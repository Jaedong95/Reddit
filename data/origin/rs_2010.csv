akj8u,depression,SarahC,tramadol - quick fix major depression fix.,"i don't have an addictive personality, so for the last 2 years i've been supplementing my anti depressants with tramadol. before i was taking it, the depressive episodes were scary - when it's been bad, i get the jumbled thoughts, inability to talk properly, dropped sentences in mid chat, incredibly tired, massive low mood, complete disappearance of any positive emotions. i occasionally look drunk. but, in the last 28 months i've kept a high stress, fast paced it job and excelled at it. i've had problems with drive - that's possibly more to do with work taking all my energy. it's been life transforming. tramadol works after a few hours and lasts around 12. you can get it online. it's an analogue of opiates - but with far less side effects, no fuzzy head, dry mouth or anything like that. the big downside is it's addictive. i think it's such a bitch that something that is so useful, and works so well and so fast can be that addictive. i've kept between 50mg to 300mg for the last two years, usually staying at 150mg day to day. i wonder if there's any more research going to be done about it's addictiveness? has anyone else had any experience with this drug? i'm interested in how useful it is in general.",20,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/akj8u/tramadol_quick_fix_major_depression_fix/,1262360328

al526,depression,unremedied,"am i depressed? also, question regarding depression and cognitive functions/emotional health","i have not told any other person about my problems, not even a doctor. i prefer to solve things on my own, but i see now that i am getting nowhere by myself. i think i may be suffering from some sort of depression and social anxiety (just guesswork really, at this point it's all self-diagnosis). i am also wondering about to what degree depression may affect memory, concentration and emotional health. i've had all of these problems for as long as i can remember (at least since early teens, i am 26 now), so i might have been depressed as long as well. i have problems concentrating, and it's starting to have detrimental effects on my performance at work and life in general. in fact i don't even rely on sequential thinking when solving problems anymore. i just hold the idea or problem in my mind, and hope something pops up. if nothing does then i'm stuck. i think ""foggy brain"" describes it well. also my memory has always (seems like) been poor, i have big problems remembering any facts. anything that is ""solid"" like names, dates, places, etc just slips away. it feels like i'm having trouble retrieving memories, not storing them though. as if all the memories are trapped in an adjoining room to the retrieval office, and there's a man in the adjoining room yelling the memories through the wall. some things gets through, the rest are muddled. i have a good ability to understand and remember complex ideas and systems though, but if asked to explain these in words then i'm at a loss again. as far as emotional health goes, i seem to have a lack of emotion. i don't get any enjoyment from anything at all. i can't remember the last time i was happy, but i'm not sad either. i don't have any suicidal thoughts, don't cry, etc. and i do have a conscience, i'm not a sociopath. i just feel empty. so, am i depressed? i'm honestly unsure myself, because of my poor memory i can't remember feeling any other way. also, could the problems described above be caused by depression? i have tried to do the suggested remedies like exercise, eating healthy, learning an instrument, playing sports, etc. but because i lack enjoyment in anything i do i find it hard to keep at it (although i'm still trying to keep at it).",13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/al526/am_i_depressed_also_question_regarding_depression/,1262551282

amt2d,depression,fastdownwardspiral,can't afford medication and going downhill fast. tell me about buying prescription drugs online.,"i was diagnosed with major depressive and generalized anxiety disorder several years ago. like many people with depression i was prescribed a variety of antidepressants until finding something that worked for me. i’ve been taking lexapro (20mg) and seroquel (10mg) since about mid 2005 and have found that particular combination worked wonders for me. in late september of 2009 i lost my job and medical coverage. i’ve since found a new job but the employer does not offer insurance. not being able to afford the doctor visits or prescriptions i had to gradually cut back on my meds until they completely ran out a couple of month’s ago. i’ve since been feeling myself spiral out of control. invasive negative thoughts, obsessing about suicide and death, severe anxiety attacks in public and become withdrawn and unable to relate to anyone. not to mention the withdrawal was fucking hell. i’m fucking miserable. i forgot how bad this used to be until it all gradually came creeping back in. the medications definitely helped and i feel without them, it’s not a matter of if i might hurt myself, but when. i’ve been researching buying drugs online but cant seem to find any information thats not vague or completely sketchy. does anyone have any experience buying prescription drugs online without a prescription? any reputable websites that aren’t going to rip me off? if it matters i live in ohio. edit for spelling",7,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/amt2d/cant_afford_medication_and_going_downhill_fast/,1262889969

b5vdu,depression,Vellon221,is this depression?,"where to start. i was with a girl coming out of high school and the following five years. all through high school, and even before i struggled with social anxiety, panic attacks and gad. the relationship was often rocky, but i put a lot of effort into it and she helped me with my problems. i finally managed to get off the xanax and live a seminormal life. about three quarters of a year ago i discovered she had been cheating on me on and off for about three months. i ended the relationship, got drunk and high for a month and then began putting myself and my life back together. i've now returned to college, have an apartment with a good friend and my two cats, etc. i've dated a couple other girls both met online and in person. i wasn't able to connect emotionally with any of these women, so they were short term affairs. things were going fairly well - i don't feel i was in denial, i was/am very cut up about the way things worked out with the original girl. starting about four weeks ago, i began to feel disconnected and gloomy. while i continue to go about my day to day life of college, and continue to spend time with my (albeit small) circle of friends, i find myself deriving only a minimum of pleasure from these occurrences. and then once i'm back at home alone my emotional state quickly plunges further and further down. i've got this black pit sitting in my gut that refuses to be shaken off. i've had horrible insomnia to top all of this off. my schoolwork is suffering and i'm worried that my friendships will be next. i've been having a lot of fantasies about selfharm although i don't think i could ever actually do it. so what i need to know is, is this depression? am i really 'depressed' and not just upset over this failed relationship and betrayal of trust? if i'm depressed, wtf do i do now? i don't have a gp, so do i just walk into a clinic?

bbst6,depression,[deleted],"i'm feeling good and happy right now, but i'm afraid that feeling is going to pass","i've been struggling with mild depression for about 2 years now. i'm a junior in college and i think it's partly due to a combination of stress and being away from home and friends. i have friends here at school, but they're nothing like my friends from home (that i've known since preschool). my friends at school seem to be more like ""time fillers"" instead of people i actually want to be around. things got really bad for me last september. my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me and school was starting again. i felt trapped and alone and helpless. slowly i pulled out of it, but things haven't been great. i've thought about my ex girlfriend a lot. and my thoughts also focus on my current lack of a girlfriend. i just sort of pushed through it feeling alone and unhappy. last week was our spring break. i went on a ski trip with my ski club from school. it was amazing. so much fun. i got to know new people, ski, and go out and party at night and have fun. it was exactly what i needed. i came back to school on an emotional high from it and a boost of confidence. the weather also turned from below freezing to spring-like. so i've just been feeling good this week. but i'm afraid it's going to go away. deep down, i know that nothing has changed. that i'm still in the same situation i've been in all year. with hard classes, mediocre friends and not much to look forward to. so i'm afraid i'm going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to come back crashing down. does anyone have any advice on how to deal with something like this? i feel like i have a fresh attitude and perspective on things, and i don't want it to go away. but i'm afraid that if i think about it too much, that's exactly what will happen.",6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bbst6/im_feeling_good_and_happy_right_now_but_im_afraid/,1268260253

bo3pt,depression,FluffyBunnikins,i need to seek help (uk) and i'm not sure where to start.,"i'm male, 26 and i've been depressed for as long as i can remember. there are many reasons for this - i'd like to believe that these are all to do with the many years of severe emotional abuse i've had to deal with, but it's possible that there is more to it. i have very rarely sought help, in any fashion. certainly no-one would help me when i was younger. the most important event was almost two years ago, when i finally went to see a gp. he was incredibly rude, did not listen at all, kept interrupting my sentances and telling me that there was nothing wrong with me - essentially that i was wasting his time. that spun me out for a few months, and i've only started to bring up enough courage to try something like that again. since then my unhappiness and lack of basic social ability (such as making eye contact - it physically hurts on occasion) has cost me jobs and relationships, the last of those was two days ago, when a girl i love more than anything, and i've been seeing for almost a year, suddenly told me she doesn't want to see me again, as my occasional bouts of misery were making her even more miserable. i'm also due to be made redundant in a couple of months, and i'm worried that i won't be able to land a new job, since i come across so appallingly in interviews. i honestly don't know where to go for help. i don't have a lot of money, and i'm very against the idea of medication (again, for a lot of reasons, some of them historical). if going to a gp is going to be anything like as painful as before, then i don't think i can stand it. i don't think i'm a suicide risk. the thought of it has always been there, but it's more comforting than anything - it's a possible exit when there doesn't seem to be any, so it can be put aside and other options can be considered. what are my options? i'm finding it very hard to think straight right now, obviously, and i've never done this kind of thing before.",10,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bo3pt/i_need_to_seek_help_uk_and_im_not_sure_where_to/,1270726131

buziz,depression,[deleted],a question to people who have overcome their depression.,"a little background info on where this question stems from. i've had depression for a number of years now and have only once tried to do anything about it. i went to a psychiatrist and was put on prozac. i started taking it and after a few weeks i started to feel genuinely happy. i wasn't just wallowing in a ball of self misery for the first time in my life. i felt optimistic about the days coming... and this scared me. even though i was happy, i was longing for the feeling of depression that i had become so accustomed to. i assume that i had made depression my 'comfort zone' and i wanted to keep it that way. i quit taking the drugs and for the next few years just did nothing but be depressed which lead to me being a complete hermit. that's another story though. today i started taking the prozac again to hopefully help get my life in order and deal with my anxiety and depression. as weird as it may sound, i actually *like* being depressed. i just feel more of myself when i'm completely down and i usually put on music that increases the feelings of depression. what i want to know is, have any other redditors that have started taking something for their depression felt uncomfortable being happy and wished to be depressed again? if so how were you able to overcome those feelings? please excuse the horrendous lack of flow in the above. writing was never my forte.",9,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/buziz/a_question_to_people_who_have_overcome_their/,1272004819

bxmza,depression,Exon,looking for help on how to deal with a loved one who has bipolar disorder,"hey reddit! so, let me start of by saying that i know the basics of bipolar disorder (aka manic depression syndrome). i know that there is a state in which the ""patient"" feels manic (happy, excited, full of energy), a normal state, and a depressive state. i'm currently seeing a girl, 25 years old, who has been diagnosed with it. now i know she has this and i would never run from it, but sometimes my efforts to help with her depressive states seem to be ineffective. for instance, currently she is not talking to me, she is staying off the radar as they say and will not communicate with me. one of the last things she told me was that she had a million things tumbling around in her head and she just needed time to figure things out. i'm scared. both that she will leave me and that there is nothing that i can do for her. what is the best approach? do i sit back and wait for her to contact me. do i try to tell her that everything is going to be fine? i'm just really confused because this ""depression"" literally showed up within hours of seeing her last and she was just fine. also, please forgive the bad typing and errors. i've been drunk for a few days now trying to decide what to do.",6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bxmza/looking_for_help_on_how_to_deal_with_a_loved_one/,1272524813

cq3mm,depression,3525252,not really depression... how to anxiety about death?,"edit: wow screwed up the title, how to handle anxiety about death? i guess this doesn't really fit here because i don't think i really am a depressed person. yeah i can often feel sad but it's not like an every day thing normally. it just seems like the anxiety subreddit is kind of dead, so i thought i would post here. whenever i stop to consider death, i have some sort of anxiety attack. i think about the permanence of death in particular and i start to be overcome with anxiety and start to hyperventilate. this often happens when i am alone and it is quiet or dark, like before going to sleep. the only way for me to overcome this at the time is to turn on the light and get up and go do something to distract myself until i fall asleep. these attacks seem to come in waves, because once i start thinking about it, it is hard not to think about it on a nightly basis. eventually, i can go a few weeks or so without thinking about it, but something will trigger it again like reading a dark book and i will be back in the routine. for example, reading the road was not a good idea. i can't bring myself to believe in anything like a heaven, anything beyond the basics of your brain goes dead and thoughts cease to fire. i wish i did believe something like this sometimes because i'd imagine it would help to believe in something after death, but i just can't convince myself. i guess i am looking for advice on how to handle this anxiety. i have read a million little phrases about how to live in the moment, go day to day, this is your only life so just enjoy it, everybody dies so why worry?, etc. how do other people deal with these thoughts? are these anxiety attacks a common thing for people? just curious.",12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cq3mm/not_really_depression_how_to_anxiety_about_death/,1279238898

[cross-post from/r/suicidewatch],"i have anxiety and depression - a lifetime of abuse from childhood. time passes, i'm in my late twenties and married. i'm a strong blue personality, and my wife is red-blue. when we have disagreements, she can make quick judgements that are only right part of the time. when this happens, i feel betrayed and alone and i 'crash'. i go into a sort of a trance/detached state. i feel as if my head is going to explode. i can't work, i can't do anything productive - i feel like if my brain is a computer, it really did crash. she and i are able to talk about it and work it out after i come out of it. we're working on my/our issues - and i've gotten better over the years. but for this, i need to get out of it first. in order for me to get out of it, to get back to clear rational thought and to feel emotionally clear again - only two things have worked. orgasm through masturbation and self harm. the nature of the self-harm is usually punching myself in the head and the face, or hitting my head on something really hard. i do it in such a way that my wife doesn't know and there would be no visible signs. i have a theory that it might be the endorphins resultant from those actions - though i could be wrong. ideally, i would like to do neither. i've been getting better at both recently and i don't want to lapse into both. recently, i've been doing more of the head punching. it used to not hurt very much but now it really hurts every time. i've given myself about 4-5 concussions over the last three years. i worry about incurring brain damage but i don't know what it would take to do so. is there a third option that i can go to that people know or have worked for others? any ideas what i can do? thanks.",7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cydxu/i_cant_stop_self_harming_can_someone_help_me_find/,1281159707

(i dont want to take medicine with side effects like suicide, also my doctor happens to be a family friend so it would be awkward to tell them i am depressed) when do i know i can drink again without having to worry about being depressed right after or that i might become an alcoholic? how do normal people feel when they are sober compared to being buzzed?",11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d1ze5/made_the_mistake_of_trying_alcohol_for_the_first/,1282015830

d973w,depression,iwillbuythatorange,just want to clarify something,"i’m 27 i’ve lived a fairly full life, i’ve studied, travelled and lived overseas, had some soul crushing relationships and some great ones, i’m fairly successful and have a decent job. i’ve had friends but have always preferred to be alone or at least do things my own way, the only reason that i feel any compulsion to interact with people and not just get off the grid and be a bum is the social/familial expectation not to. i know that on face value my life sounds ok but i’ve worked my way up through destitution, continual suicidal depression and major drug addiction so it’s not all rosy. i’ve come from rolling around in the dirt to having more money than i ever thought that i would have trough hard work, i’m not rich by any means but i just don’t want it. i’ve just been working my arse off and keeping my head down for so long and really feel like i’ve missed something. the other day i woke up and realised that i just didn’t care anymore, not just a bad day but an end game. my lease ends in two weeks, i’ve given most of my savings to a charity, cut off everyone that i know and i’m leaving my job/career in a week. i just don’t care anymore. there is a very real chance that i will be homeless for a substantial period in the near future. i have some experience living rough but i’m older now and i’m not sure that i’ll get by. i know the country/forest well so i’m planning to live in the sticks out of the way for a while. i’ve been lurking here for at least a year and have seen a few posts that really struck home and would appreciate any advice from anybody a bit older and wiser who has any idea what i’m talking about. tldr; every aspect of my life has ceased to make any sense. cut all ties. need help from those who are older, have done it before and made sense of it.",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d973w/just_want_to_clarify_something/,1283528613

(and yes, i'm aware that my analogy could use some work...) yet, that's exactly what i do in depression. the second you start feeling down and out - and this is still a revolutionary idea for me - *do something about it!* play a game, walk a dog, annoy a cat, order dessert, run some laps, go swimming, plant something, help someone else, take a smoke break, make a sandwich, look at lolcats - anything! so often, if i feel down, my first reaction is to kick myself for it - i'll 'forget' to take medications, sleep through things and blame myself for it, avoid work and dwell on it... don't do these things. its a slippery slope. once you take a step down, you'll just pick up momentum. when you feel down, think about what's making you sad - and if, like me, they're irrelevant, self-created, trivial problems - tell them to fuck themselves. take a break. indulge. do something that makes you happy - and this is important - **as soon as you can.** every second you spend depressed is another second you could spend being... well, happy! next time you feel down, just do one simple thing - **fight back.** you're worth it - remember that.",8,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dimey/depression_is_an_illness/,1285387100

dkhai,depression,throwaway7326,need some advice on whether to go to a doctor or not.,"im 16 and i'm in the uk, england to be exact. just to give a little backstory, i have been pretty depressed for about three years now. i'm not sure if 'depression' is the right word, which is one of the reasons i want to go to the doctors. anyway, i feel really down almost all of the time, i also seem to have random mood spikes and although this might just sound like general teenage behaviour it's alot more extreme. for example when i am in a bad place i will ocaisionally hyperventilate, cry and just sit in my room on the floor. i think this are panic/anxiety attacks but i'm not sure. i have these from time to time (perhaps once a month, sometimes more) and i have had two in public places. one was with one of my friends and nothing was said to trigger it, and another was at a festival after seeing one of my ex girlfriends. later that same day i ended up standing over a bridge trying to make myself jump (i was alone here) and of course i didn't but i constantly have these suicidal thought but thankfully wimp out at the last moment. it is hard for me to pinpoint exactly what it is that is making me feel so bad and what i should do about it if anything. i don't struggle to make friends, i do well at college, but life for me just seems extremely lacking. anyway, i told my bestfriend how i have been feeling recently (i don't generally like sharing my feelings but i thought this was worth it) and she suggested that i go to a doctor as she was worried about me (i'm worried about me too, of course). so my question is: should i go to a doctor? if so, how do i go to the doctor without my parents knowing? what sort of things will happen while i'm there? and how likely is it that he will prescribe me anti depressants, because i'm not sure if i really want to be drugged up. also how do they react to things like this? alot of questions but i'm kind of confused. if you need more information just ask.",4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dkhai/need_some_advice_on_whether_to_go_to_a_doctor_or/,1285765100

e2s0j,depression,sundaryourfriend,some css magic to better indicate the motivating posts from those asking for help?,"there are mainly two kinds of posts on this subreddit: those from depressed people asking for help, and those from helpful people providing resources that might help. these posts are also intended for entirely different audiences: the first kind towards the people who post the second kind, and vice versa. so my suggestion is that we separate these two kinds of posts by some visual indication so that it reaches the right audience. as someone recovering from depression, i have to admit that there have been quite a few times when i've come to this subreddit for solace, only to have my negative thinking reaffirmed by others in depression, and have ended up worse than before. one thing to note is that it is probably too much to ask people in mounting pain to remember to mark their posts with something every time. so i'd propose that posts are by default considered to be someone asking for help, unless it's tagged by some magic phrase. something like [resource] feels right (with [request] being the optional counterpart), though it perhaps is not too clear - what do you think? also, the phrase by itself may be useful, but coloring the posts differently or some other similar magic might be even more useful. if we agree on some good way of doing this, we might post the request to r/somebodymakethis and get it done. edit: it would be awesome if it's possible to dim out the negative posts by default (implicitly assuming a person is here asking for help) and ""undim"" them after we check something like ""i'm a volunteer, no problem for me"". the folks at r/android are doing all sorts of magic with css and getting input from users about carriers, etc., so a simple volunteers/others checkbox shouldn't be a problem i hope.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2s0j/some_css_magic_to_better_indicate_the_motivating/,1289192418

e6tjy,depression,doublefuck,i'm in a really bad place and i don't know what to do,"i've been depressed for almost seven years. when middle school started, i immediately had zero friends, and i was singled out as the weird girl. nobody talked to me except to make fun of me, usually in groups that would corner me and pretend to perform exorcisms on me because i wasn't christian. i coped by turning off my emotions, so that nobody would see me cry. this quickly evolved into depression. since then i've been almost completely numb. the highest my mood ever goes is ""meh"", and the only real emotions i can feel are anger and the occasional deranged fear of a panic attack. i laugh and smile and act sympathetic at all the right times in conversation, but they're just reflexes. usually i can keep a lid on my depression. i may feel awful, but i can still get my shit together, appreciate that i'm not starving in some third world country, and do the things i have to do. but lately i just keep slipping; i can't manage more than a day or two of acting normal before my mood falls so low that i can't stop crying, and i have to pretend to be sick in bed so that nobody will see me. my parents have always given me the least emotional attention of my siblings, but it's starting to get to me in a terrible way. i told them i was depressed exactly 13 months ago today, and neither of them have done anything but give me superficial offers of support. when i try to take them up on those offers, they more or less tell me that i'm a whiny bitch. they constantly call me lazy and a bullshitter for always saying i'm sick. and now they've started yelling at me for every little thing. if i raise my voice slightly or disagree and don't immediately concede the point, they start shouting, telling me that i'm the cause of their health problems. they just badger me while i repeat that i haven't done anything wrong, and i feel like i'm back in middle school. i can't talk to the one person who usually listens to me, because things have finally started going well for him, and i don't want to drag him down. i can only sleep for a few hours at a time before i wake up panicking. i average one meal a day, and i always feel sick to my stomach afterward. all i want to do is cry and hit something. i feel like i'm losing my mind. i don't see an end to this.",18,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6tjy/im_in_a_really_bad_place_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,1289888412

ejigs,depression,[deleted],why does sadness feel so good?,"it's like some kind of cathartic release sometimes, sitting here weeping. there's beauty in it, almost like a negative euphoria; it feels just as true and right as happiness. but when you're happy, you look back on the sad times as 'pathetic'; forgetting they're just as real, just as poignant. i almost crave the feeling of sadness as a release; it really is quite curious, for a 19-year old. it's occurred to me that i like being happy but hate the chase, the obsession for happiness. i hate the desires, the needs, the desires, the whole lot. it creates fake friendships, the false idea that you are getting somewhere in life, that you as an individual are important or significant in any way, the goal orientation, the ridiculous idea of 'success', whatever the hell that even means. but most of all i hate the taboo. the likes of 'don't worry, be happy'. happiness has replaced any religious god as our master and we are slaves to it. what we want, really, is satisfaction. to kick back and say 'that was okay after all'; the good times and the bad are both included in that. and to feel that way, i need to throw any notions of happiness out of the window, to just accept my feelings as what they are as all necessary parts to a whole. and sure, if i'm sad all my life, i'm performing a duty which is necessary for someone else to be 'happy'. they can look over at me, see my sadness, and think 'boy, i'm glad i'm not him!' (of course, it'd be far more respectful for that person to say 'i have utmost respect for your sadness, for you allow me to feel happiness') - indeed, their happiness *depends* on me being sad, and my sadness requires me to look at other 'happy' people and say 'wow, those lot are having a good time, why aren't i?' and so i no longer see depression as a negative thing but rather a way of life which comes and goes. i relish in it. it's the depression that 'too, will pass'.",11,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejigs/why_does_sadness_feel_so_good/,1291985349

eu325,depression,rmm45177,it's 2 in the morning and i can't sleep because i can't stop thinking about how much i've fucked up my life.,"i just turned 17 the other day and had another birthday all by myself. i've been trying to get in the mindset that having friends or not don't really matter but that's just bullshit i tell myself. the reality is that i desperately want friends but i've just gotten to the point where i've given up on having any. i keep worrying about getting older because even though i don't like school, i don't know how i'll be able to go on when its done. everyone else has their lives all planned out and they have people who care about them and will help them not fall in their face. i feel like i'm way behind. i just can't believe that i missed out on being a kid and the reality that i'll never have a 2nd chance is too much for me.",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eu325/its_2_in_the_morning_and_i_cant_sleep_because_i/,1293782885
