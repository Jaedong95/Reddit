akj8u,depression,SarahC,tramadol - quick fix major depression fix,"i don't have an addictive personality, so for the last 2 years i've been supplementing my anti depressants with tramadol before i was taking it, the depressive episodes were scary - when it's been bad, i get the jumbled thoughts, inability to talk properly, dropped sentences in mid chat, incredibly tired, massive low mood, complete disappearance of any positive emotions i occasionally look drunk but, in the last 28 months i've kept a high stress, fast paced it job and excelled at it i've had problems with drive - that's possibly more to do with work taking all my energy it's been life transforming tramadol works after a few hours and lasts around 12 you can get it online it's an analogue of opiates - but with far less side effects, no fuzzy head, dry mouth or anything like that the big downside is it's addictive i think it's such a bitch that something that is so useful, and works so well and so fast can be that addictive i've kept between 50mg to 300mg for the last two years, usually staying at 150mg day to day i wonder if there's any more research going to be done about it's addictiveness? has anyone else had any experience with this drug? i'm interested in how useful it is in general",20,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/akj8u/tramadol_quick_fix_major_depression_fix/,1262360328

al526,depression,unremedied,"am i depressed? also, question regarding depression and cognitive functions/emotional health","i have not told any other person about my problems, not even a doctor i prefer to solve things on my own, but i see now that i am getting nowhere by myself i think i may be suffering from some sort of depression and social anxiety (just guesswork really, at this point it's all self-diagnosis) i am also wondering about to what degree depression may affect memory, concentration and emotional health i've had all of these problems for as long as i can remember (at least since early teens, i am 26 now), so i might have been depressed as long as well i have problems concentrating, and it's starting to have detrimental effects on my performance at work and life in general in fact i don't even rely on sequential thinking when solving problems anymore i just hold the idea or problem in my mind, and hope something pops up if nothing does then i'm stuck i think ""foggy brain"" describes it well also my memory has always (seems like) been poor, i have big problems remembering any facts anything that is ""solid"" like names, dates, places, etc just slips away it feels like i'm having trouble retrieving memories, not storing them though as if all the memories are trapped in an adjoining room to the retrieval office, and there's a man in the adjoining room yelling the memories through the wall some things gets through, the rest are muddled i have a good ability to understand and remember complex ideas and systems though, but if asked to explain these in words then i'm at a loss again as far as emotional health goes, i seem to have a lack of emotion i don't get any enjoyment from anything at all i can't remember the last time i was happy, but i'm not sad either i don't have any suicidal thoughts, don't cry, etc and i do have a conscience, i'm not a sociopath i just feel empty so, am i depressed? i'm honestly unsure myself, because of my poor memory i can't remember feeling any other way also, could the problems described above be caused by depression? i have tried to do the suggested remedies like exercise, eating healthy, learning an instrument, playing sports, etc but because i lack enjoyment in anything i do i find it hard to keep at it (although i'm still trying to keep at it)",13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/al526/am_i_depressed_also_question_regarding_depression/,1262551282
ale8v,depression,i_am_ready,help me find the way forward,"tl;dr: i'm an irresponsible, depressed, fatalistic father miserable in his current circumstances and unsure how to change them i've always struggled with feeling like a failure, and with depression i grew up in a traditional nuclear family, where mom took care of the house and bills, and dad took care of handiwork and the cars i wasn't very interested in manual labor, and got some pretty harsh criticism from my dad that i still carry with me, even though we're on better terms now after 5 years of college, i got my girlfriend of 6 months pregnant, and dropped out school to get married rather than finish it up i managed to get on a helpdesk for a large company back in '99, and things seemed to be looking up we had an apartment, and i was able to support the 3 of us i realized quickly that my wife was not the homemaker that i was expecting, and would lie to me rather than start fights with the truth about what she spent money on, or why the money didn't go toward bills we had issues keeping a 2 bedroom apartment clean, and bills that should have been easy to cover began going unpaid we would talk about these things, but no resolution would ever come of them over the years i've been on and off anti-depressants, but i can't see the good in taking something to go numb when it doesn't change the life that i'm living fast forward 11 years and 3 more kids we now have a perpetually chaotic house that we've gone into bankruptcy to keep, a van that won't run and that i can't afford to get fixed, and this morning i find that the car that i haven't been able to afford to get an oil change for in months won't start due to the cold i realize that i'm reaping the reward of my choices, but i don't know how to make everyone around me happy i'm not a happy person by nature, mostly because i brood over all of the mistakes that i've made in the last 11 years that have brought us to this point i have no money in the bank, no equity in the house, zero chance of getting credit to fix anything, and a churning stomach i'm not trying to avoid blame my kids run wild, my house is a disaster, and i don't really even try to make things better i'm like a kid stuck waiting for someone to tell me what to do next, and while i don't like living this way, on some level i know that i want to see it all fall around me i want to fail i hope for a terminal illness or a fatal accident daily, so that it can finally come to an end i want to start over, and i know that i can't, but i have no idea how to make it better",5,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ale8v/help_me_find_the_way_forward/,1262616800

alsov,depression,BillTheRedditor,"hi reddit, i'm struggling with admitting i need help","i'm a 23 year old male who has been suffering from recurring stages of depression and anxiety for almost three years up until recently, ive been denial about how i felt, and i did everything i could to hide it from those close to me i now am considering seeking help, but still find myself struggling with going through with it i haven't talked to many people about my experiences, so i greatly appreciate this space for redditors to talk about depression my depression seems to be episodic in nature i quickly go from a relatively happy and normal state to a deep feeling of self-loathing, which could often persists for days before i feel somewhat normal again the states are sometimes triggered by a stressful event, but other times come clear out of the blue during them, i feel as though i am completely alone and disconnected from the world, not just in a social sense, but as if i were just watching a movie of my life rather than actually being present in it i feel like i succumb to panic attacks, where i suddenly feel a rush of seemingly unprovoked fear and anxiety towards a situation and become petrified by the whole experience most persistently, though, i seem to shift into periods of intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and animosity directed towards myself i sometimes focus this self-directed aggression into suicidal thoughts, but they are somewhat superficial in nature, as i've never truly felt the desire to end my life i feel as though i need to punish myself for failing at something or making a misstep in a social relationship of even the smallest degree, and that that the negativity i direct towards myself is just part of that punishment when alone, i cry a lot when around others, i try to hide how i am feeling by acting happy and smiling eventually, gradually or rapidly, i feel as though i am returning to normal it is this complete feeling of ""normalcy"" that has kept me in denial of my depression i would rationalize to myself that, because i no longer felt any feelings of gloom and doom, that there must not be anything wrong i tell myself i was just being ""dramatic"", or that stress like that is a regular part of life i brush off the thoughts of suicide, as i really have no desire to end die i again feel as though i like myself, enjoy living and being alive, and am in control of whatever situation is at hand i choose to just ignore the whole event and move on like nothing happened but after almost 3 years of going through these unpredictable ups and downs, i've come to realize that the almost unbearable intensity and frequency of these experiences, warranted or not, is not healthy i also feel as if i am allowing them to happen more and more frequently, and that they do not seem to be going away by ignoring them which brings me to my current situation: i am again in one of my normal periods, and feel relatively happy and stable not but two days ago, however, i went through another phase of panic attacks and depression, and during this time i finally opened up to my family about it they suggested i make an appointment with my doctor to get a referral to a counselor or psychologist/psychiatrist feeling like i had hit some sort of emotional ""rock-bottom"", and finally wanting to admit that i was suffering, i agreed to make the appointment, and to start seeking help for my condition the problem is, now that i again feel normal, i feel like i don't need any sort of counseling or treatment for my condition the machismo attitude of ""tough it out, be a man"" has again taken its place in my consciousness i am embarrassed to tell my doctor, whom i've known for years, that i am depressed i feel like going to therapy would be too much of a hassle, and that because all the things necessary for a happiness are around me, i have no real reason to feel depressed, so my feelings cant be legitimate i haven't lost my house or my job, i have good friends and a kind family, i have a girlfriend whom i love and care for very deeply, what would i possibly talk to a counselor about? i tell myself i'm just whining needlessly, and that others have it a lot worse, so i should just shut up about it all i fear that i'm just trying to retreat into denial again, so i've come here in hopes of getting an outside perspective have any of you been through or know someone who has been through the kinds of experiences i describe? if so, did anything help them recover? do i need to seek treatment for this, or should i try to get over it on my own? what kind of treatment do you think a doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist would recommend for my condition? i'm a bit resistant to the idea of taking medication to help with my condition, should i be? if i did start taking medication, would i have to take it indefinitely? thank you for taking the time to read through this, i would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have -bill",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/alsov/hi_reddit_im_struggling_with_admitting_i_need_help/,1262701087

aqsmy,depression,notokcupid,matt &amp; kim only go so far,"i wasn't sure if i should post this in suicide watch, but i haven't really felt that bad since summer '08 i am 19, i go to a community college when i was in middle school, i applied to a magnet school (ib) even though my parents didn't want me to because they said it was too far away i applied anyway, got accepted, and went anyway after finding out the state provided free bus transportation i met some cool people, but i never really became friends with any of them, just colleagues i guess i was set on doing something in the sciences or maths because that's what my parents have always wanted, a male child who is either a doctor, engineer, or architect at first i liked those subjects, but as my parents, the state, and people around me kept shoving stem down my throat i started to resent it i would escape to my drawings, and come up with crazy stories for myself and just isolate myself in order to get away from everything since i had no outlet other than a gamecube (which got boring) senior year came, i applied to the state unis, got accepted, but i couldn't afford any of them even with pell grant and bright future scholarship i could afford the commuter state school uni which is where my sister went (housing with parents), but i changed my mind on what i wanted to do i kept reading everywhere that i should ask myself, ""where do you want to be 10 years"", the answer was animating that's what i did i applied to the local cc and bought books on animation, on art fundamentals, color theory, looked at tutorials online, gathered soundbites, joined forums and started to go at it i was having a lot of fun, for it's exciting to see the story you came up with, seeing those lines, just come to life after pouring hours into it i was also drawing, and painting, and still am i don't have anyone to share these things with though it's fun and i show them to my parents but they look more disappointed than anything which i guess i understand since my parents are not rich by any means they immigrated here about 20 years ago and have been working multiple shifts and late nights in manual labor to give my sister and i a roof over our heads, food, and small luxuries i just feel horrible doing what i'm doing this is something that i've always felt with my parents, just huge guilt whether it was because i went to a friend's house one saturday to build a computer, or told them i was going out to buy a book at the mall it was always this stigma of being a thug of the streets; ""un vago maliante"" i used to be really good with just looking ahead and just ""keep doing what i'm doing"", but it's not working in high school i had at least some human contact because we were forced to sit next to each other in class i now just lock myself in my room, draw, read up on painting, and occasionally check out reddit and the old facebook to see how much fun those kids who went to unis are having like i said, i used to be good at just ignoring it all and focusing on what i was doing it gets really lonely though and it really sucked when my dog died last year because she was the only pal i had i do volunteer, i actually helped out in a couple of festivals, i also do exercise because i heard it's good for you all around, and i tried to start an animation club myself at the cc, but that failed i don't have a job, but have been looking even that though my parents object to, they rationalize that i'm going to get stuck doing that same job for the rest of my life and want better for me than that because, they truly have sacrificed a lot i just want some advice, some words of wisdom from anyone because i don't have anyone to talk to about this i tried out okcupid looking for friends, but gave up because it's worse than real life speaking of which, i've never had a gf, much less a kiss, nor even a ""best friend"" in my whole entire life i'm also not that repulsive 5'6"" 140lbs, not incredibly boring i've also been thinking of just becoming and engineer or something i don't like it and i hate the idea of it, and even now as i take my physics w/calc class, i just start sketching all over the margins also if it weren't for music, i probably wouldn't have made it as ""far"" as i have i probably sound cheery, but i'm at a high i guess right now it gets bad to the point where my stomach starts hurting when i realize what an isolated person i am tl;dr i'm 19, live with my parents, don't have a job, never had a gf nor a real friend in my life i gave up multiple acceptances to state unis to follow my pipe-dream of animation at a cc i have no friends, i just draw and paint all day with extreme guilt because my parents would very much rather have me in a stem job although that keeps me busy, at the end of the day, not having anyone to talk to or share this with sucks",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/aqsmy/matt_kim_only_go_so_far/,1263774084

arcq6,depression,underafalsename,what's the way out?,"back in high school, i was on medication, nothing hardcore, and i don't remember what it was called what the doctor said at the time, was that my levels of some chemicals (serotonin?) were lower than average, diet was pretty healthy at that time though at 18, i left home, and i went off the medication, because i regarded relying on it as weak, and have been off it ever since i always had an independent streak, and basically went my own way (skipped university up until 2005, did half of my degree part time on my own dime) thankfully, the it industry arrived just in time so that i could work in my hobby, and didn't end up being a bum on the streets did a fair amount of chemicals up until 21 though at 22, i decided to emigrate to new zealand, at which time i pretty much stopped everything except drinking, and stayed clean up until now (age 29), to make sure i could get residence/citizenship i kind of replaced substance abuse with wow addiction for almost four years (2005 till late 2009) things were going well, i was happy, reasonably my career did quite well, worked my way up from pretty much exactly par with gdp, to the top 3% bracket it feels like i have hit a glass ceiling of sorts though, at work, and in life, and i'm at a loss as to how to get out of it i'm an introvert by nature, and emigration didn't help on the friend front - i have made just 2 friends since moving here, despite living here for 9 years now i've lost touch with all my friends from the old country i'm not anti-social, i like hanging out with people i like, i'm just shy as all fuck, i don't get comfortable to the extent i can start taking the piss out of people, and have a good, fun, non-serious conversation until i know someone quite well my response has been to closet up and limit my exposure as you can imagine, being mr serious doesn't exactly make people enjoy my company either, especially with the opposite sex thing is, that totally isn't the sum of me, i just have a fucked sense of humor that i don't feel comfortable showing until people are cool with it i have no friends i can count on if shit gets really fucked basically - i don't know where my life is going, i keep feeling ""is this it"", and the old suicidal thoughts are rolling back in most of my friends back home are married, have bought homes, you know the whole deal here i sit with 9 years spent here, nothing to show for it, just an overpriced car, geek toys, and lots of debt my girlfriend of 7 years, bless her, is understandably wondering where things are going with us adding to the stress is the fact that her parents are extremely conservative asians (i am european) i kind of feel like i'm not going to measure up to their standards, not having a degree, and coming from a very poor background i still harbor some resentment towards my parents as well, for paying for my older brother's university studies despite being as poor as we were, whereas i've been grafting my whole life since leaving home, and now there's no money for me to study (they must have thought ""he'll be alright"") but i really resent it a lot, it's stupid and selfish i know i just begrudge it because he's doing absolutely nothing with his degree sometimes it just gets tiring swimming uphill all the fucking time i know i have no right to complain, there are many people out there in a much more dire situation but i really have difficulty finding any enjoyment in life whatsoever me and my partner went on a road-trip recently, and despite driving through what most people would regard as awe-inspiring scenery, i took a couple of snaps and just sped on i sit inside 95% of the time that i'm home, and the rest of the time i'm at work, when i'm not working weekends i used to love tech, but i just want to switch off when i get home, and veg out, watch tv, or drink escapism essentially i know i should try and finish my degree, but i can't see how i can take the amount of time that i need off to give it the attention it deserves i know that if i can find the willpower from somewhere, i'll absolutely nail it, i had a 4 0 gpa until i started playing wow but i have no willpower i find it extremely hard to follow through, whereas in my early 20s i was turbocharged (positive reinforcement maybe), and the lack of follow-through on anything is a negative spiral i have this debt hanging over me, which i've had for over 3 years now, essentially putting my life in hold becuase it just doesn't decrease in size so no house, no travels basically i'm a wage slave i couldn't survive one month without a paycheck, with my obligations i've contemplated suicide a couple of times, recently, for the first time in years basically i'm a mess and i've no idea what to do i know i have to get out of debt, but i'm absolutely terrible at doing so, i'm a real impulse buyer everyone who knows me thinks i'm this real motivated, hardworking successful guy, but it's all a big fucking lie :( all my old friends are off working at google or the next hot start-up, and i feel like an absolute failure doing this middle-of-the-road work at an anonymous company while they're out there living their dreams how do i get to being the optimistic happy guy i used to be? i feel one-dimensional and worthless now :( hold no punches, i'm perfectly capable of taking it, i'm my own biggest critic",6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/arcq6/whats_the_way_out/,1263887795

b2k61,depression,[deleted],depression vs bipolar,"hi /r/depression, recent events have raised questions in my mind as to whether my mental diagnosis is complete specifically, i've been formally diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in the past i'm trying to separate personality components from bipolar symptoms, and am probably not qualified to do it i've known my whole life i had some form of depression it runs all throughout my mom's side of the family both of my sisters have some sort of depression when i was very young, i scored the absolute lowest possible on a test of risk-taking, meaning i was extremely risk averse i had self-esteem issues throughout school and had my first major depressive episode when i was 16 due to the toxic high school environment, and my ignorance of social norms episodes two and three came during college and post-college, and were always characterized by a near complete mental breakdown the most recent one had a very minor auditory hallucination experience, of which i got so worried i immediately contacted my psychiatrist i have been on almost every ssri with limited success, and am on wellbutrin xl currently despite my depression, i remain extremely driven and headstrong, and am a ruthless perfectionist with myself i hate self-diagnosing, but a good friend of mine was discussing her recent bipolar diagnosis, and it concerned me wikipedia's list of hypomania symptoms is, well, a bit close to what i can experience from time to time generally, any time i start a new project at home or work, my view of the world drastically improves very few things can move me to this extent not only does it evict depression, but i get so excited over it i sometimes have trouble sleeping, often preoccupied with the future direction of the project, and getting very ahead of myself it is as if i become obsessed with the concept of *epic* and propagating it (i apologize for tripping an internet meme alarm, but it really fits the idea) i mostly function normally otherwise as expected, this high does not last longer than a week or two then, i return to a fairly volatile set of moods, and eventually seek out another high this bothers me because i always chalked this behavior up to being passionate about the things i do, and being sensitive about it because most people are not as sensitive, i tend to regard them as having very little emotional depth to their emotions (this isn't a good belief to hold) in actuality, they do not wear them on their sleeve, and aren't held hostage by them, like i am i become depressed if i am not allowed to be adequately creative my free time is spent entirely on creative outlets of music and programming i have difficulty relaxing in my free time because of the goals i want to achieve in both of those areas the continual good and bad stress wears on my body i fear falling in love the most, but not just because of the vulnerability the emotion overwhelms absolutely everything and is nearly debilitating i avoid it out of self-preservation does anyone have any experience with navigating the differences between depression and bipolar? i know not to seek medical advice from strangers, but i am interested in the experience of others i will be restarting therapy asap",14,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b2k61/depression_vs_bipolar/,1266300376

i just want to vent, i'm sorry the reason, i don't want to make friends i don't want to put the effort forth for me, to be social is to work at it it's not easy i have to put on a show and you know this is only when i'm down i mean just before i hit his page i was pretty happy i'm pretty sure i got a 100 on my calc test yesterday, my professor just emailed the key today to check i just finished my crit thinking final today and am fairly confident i'm going to get an a in the class now but it's just it boggles my mind, how everything just switches and right now just writing, i don't feel so bad anymore and i read the first few sentences and it's awkward i feel nothing for it i know i felt it, but i feel nothing from it why? i know i was just happy, but i don't care anymore it's to the point that i can't trust my own feelings and it's hard to know what to believe anymore when i found out my wife was cheating on me i felt dead but i was able to rationalize what happened, how i need to act, and to be wary of my emotions of course i wanted to destroy her and then what, i asked myself to keep me in check i did this, because when my ex left me in highschool (i was a total asshole), i let my own emotions control me i was destroying myself i didn't drink or do any drugs but my mind was just killing me i pretty much holed myself up in my room for about two weeks food tasted like crap i had to force myself to eat i barely slept if at all i just couldn't stop thinking i couldn't turn it off i would run down the hill from my house and sprint up as fast as i could i was defective it took about two years to completely get over her this was without communicating with her at all from the break up to when i finally wrote a letter saying how everyday i wish i could blow my brains out for everything i did to her and how sick and depressed i am i wrote a lot trying to explain my guilt over her and my depression she never responded and i was finally able to begin my closure over her i tried really hard not to blame my assholeish actions on my depressions, but i'm sure writing about both in a letter is sure to confuse i felt after the letter i did everything in my reasonable power to communicate with her, she did not want to see me in person so i left a letter at her house the thing that eats me up the most, is the what if so this really helped me i was able to walk away, knowing i did my best to communicate in person and to salvage whatever relationship (no as lovers) that was available a few years later i see her and a friend (for another friend's birthday) my ex was drunk and she said something like that letter you wrote, i really hated it her friend stopped her from saying more i couldn't have cared less i did a little i guess but her comment, confirmed my reasoning to get over her that she didn't care about me anymore and it was a waste of energy to worry about her or worried that i made her depressed too or whatever it was clear to me that i did not exist to her anymore and it's so much easier to move on after knowing that i wrote that letter in one of my darkest depressions you know that scene in dirty filthy love, where the guy goes to his ex-wifes party trying to speak with her? and the ex is just yelling at him to leave and his friend comes in, trying to save him, saying ""he only wanted to talk with you why couldn't you just talk with him??"" and it brought back so many feelings when i was writing that letter i just wanted to talk i'm sorry i was an asshole for two years i've been trying to rationalize my behavior since then i try to picture my life on a movie screen, and how i (the audience) would critisize the movie-me only a loser would do that it helps keeps things in perspective for the longest time i tried to relish in my feelings, good and bad (mostly bad, or maybe not i can't tell anymore ), that's what makes us human right? it took me years and years to finally admit that perhaps something was wrong with me the navy has these commercials, well the military does, on afn (armed forces network) that are like psa type commercials about depression there were cardboard cutouts of people just standing in a room and some guy is just walking between them like they don't matter that he's so out of place that even in a room full of friends he feels they're all strangers, because well they don't know him so the last sentence was what was going through my head, because in the navy i felt that a lot i was in for 6 since getting out i'm still sorting through my life and feelings though my moods have stabilized a lot, the more aware i am of my moods and potential triggers when it does hit man i'm just so sick of it i want to be like plath, taking those sleeping pills one by one feeling the life drift away from me or like wurtzel, taking those atarax pills one by one because frankly who cares it was actually very weird for me reading that part because i haven't heard of an atarax allergy pill since i stopped taking it maybe 15 years ago when claritin started becoming popular ah fuck it move on i appreciate anyone who can read all of this though i know it sounds very boring and not extreme at all and is very cluttered but thanks i don't feel i need advice but if anyone can share similar stories of coming to terms with their depressions, i will appreciate it if you want to say something to the effect of, people with depression do not get as in calculus or have a professional work ethic, then you can go fuck yourself i've heard this enough there's got to be more horribly depressed people with seemingly put together lives if work needs to be done, i'll do it but at the end of the day, work stays at work, and i'm at home hoping to bleed my depression away",5,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b3ig2/just_another_one_who_wants_to_share_his_story/,1266484830
b4s66,depression,rusle,my history and current predicament,"the history i'm telling you is pretty graphic and rough but i want to let it be known that i'm not trying to make this into some kind of pissing contest the reason i'm telling you is so you have some kind of background about where i am today, i'll try to get into the right amount of detail but eh, you can ask if you have further questions throughout my teens i suffered from depression and was on and off a few different kinds of anti-depressants i decided i'm not a big pill guy on account of the ed problems which would most likely exacerbate my issues (if anyone knows something weaker than lithium that doesn't have the ed problems, i'd be more than willing to look it up) it's hard to figure out where it came from, but some of it is definitely genetic part of it is probably also due to that puberty hit me in all the wrong ways i got ridiculous amounts of acne (had to go on accutane aka the strong stuff, but didn't start on it til college), i got braces + 4 (seriously 4) retainers and all the awkward puberty stuff, but i never really enjoyed the same kind of growth spurts or muscle build up or any of the good stuff that's supposed to come with the bad stuff as a result i had a horrible history with girls and whenever i'd stick my head out and try to ask a girl out it would inevitably fail i'd say that at this point in my life i've probably asked out / made real attempts to get into a romantic relationship with around 30 girls of those the longest relationship i've had has been a month, which still only amounted to having spent about 6 hours together, and the success rate of actually going out on a date is around 10% i lost my virginity when i was just shy of 21 to a girl after we had hung out as friends twice and 30 minutes after i had told her i was a virgin i tried to contact her afterward but to no avail by definition a pity fuck while it was great to get over being a virgin, there was definitely no kind of emotional fulfillment out of it i was just giving a little bit of my history of girls with that, but some other things happened during that time when i was around 16 i started having hallucinations my psychiatrist at the time said he thought it was ""depression with psychotic features"" but i'd bet he thought i just wanted attention because my hallucinations didn't fit any standard archetypes (i wasn't having severe issues with staying coherent/sociable + i was having visual hallucinations which steers away from standard psychosis, but i wasn't paranoid and the hallucinations weren't related so that steered away from schizophrenia) today i'm fairly sure that what i had was actually hypnagogic hallucinations (when you wake up and you're in a mix between your own world and a nightmare) and the rest was in my head you kind of start second guessing reality after waking up in the night to a hallucination of a dog trying to rape you (sorry about the shocker, but i think it's the best way to describe how bad these things were, i remember after my first really bad one i couldn't sleep without the lights on as a 16 year old) i also tried the whole self-mutilation bit by cutting myself but it didn't seem to do anything so i didn't do it i tried to kill myself a few times during my freshmen year of college (over the girl problems + i was being consistently bullied/mocked by my pledge brothers) i'd always run off with some means of offing myself but would back out at the last second i also used to be christian, but my faith wasn't really strong enough to deal with all that shit and that went away, which led to less support than before i've also been dealing with alcoholism, i drank myself into a hospital when i was 22, i've gotten drunk and severely beat a person with what would amount to big metal pipe i think the biggest bender i ever had was about a month and a half of getting drunk every day i used to smoke a lot of pot to self medicate, but that didn't help much except to drain my wallet so i've quit that but, luckily there's a happy part of this story through some unforeseen event i ended up getting an instrument to play an ukulele i ended up loving it and directing everything i had in it and i can say today that with no feeling of boasting that i am quite good at it it's helped a lot with my depression and my hallucinations seem to have died down to having one every 5 months or so (don't quite know why) there were of course good things too, i've always had friends and family to help me, not to mention psychiatry i think without that stuff i'd be somewhere very different right now that pretty much brings you up to speed (a couple things omitted that i don't want to talk about over the internet) what's weird is that i've done a complete 180 and am for the most part relentlessly cheerful my dilemma right now is that i had to graduate earlier than i expected (i was going to stay in college one more semester for a minor) but financial problems kept me from that at this point i decided to take a look at what i most wanted to change in my life first was finding a job second was finding a girl so i decided to be proactive on that front and do something about it and it sucked i've put in a dozen job applications (using and haven't even gotten a response yet i've messaged probably 15 girls through various websites i didn't get a response, but i did get a girl who messaged me out of the blue, we're working on setting up a date the thing is, i have pretty low hopes for this date, because (apart from my experiences in the past) this girl seems more than a little off (but then again who's talking right?) which is not to mention she lives more than an hour away and seems to be a pretty adamant baptist whereas i'm a fairly adamant atheist i really hope i'm not sabotaging myself on this one, i've been known to do it before, and god help me i'm trying not to do it this time ugh, just thinking about this kind of thing is killing me there's been lots of reasons it hasn't worked out for me and various girls including things like one girl who wouldn't kiss me after being together three weeks and would only come over when i cooked something or one girl that they thought i was a drunk or whatever what creeps me out was the last girl i tried to ask out all of a sudden lost interest in me after she found out i wasn't christian i'm really worried about that happening again thanks for reading, in some kind of sick way i hope you enjoyed it i'd love some suggestions and of

(sorry for the,"i'm 22 years old (m) and i've felt depressed and on again, off again suicidal since i was a child i've done a good job up until recent years holding myself together and presenting a good face to the rest of the world in college, however, cracks started to show despite an inglorious highschool career where i ended with no social contacts that i could even call friends, i hadn't subject my family to the full brunt of my problems i do recognize that my depression factored into my mistakes in high school, but the ensuing rejection made matters much worse so, back to college, where all my insecurities and weaknesses became magnified, especially those about women, my creative work, and my likability/worth as a person i began to seriously consider hanging myself nonetheless, the friends i made in college, mixed with the breaks and the good grades i got out of hard work in the university environment kept me going in fact, i became a praise-whore, and the direction that i got the most praise in (political science) was where i got drawn it didn't make me happy, though in fact, the more i got involved with ps, the more people (professors i admired) began to treat me like some sort of prodigy in the field, signing me up for projects and activities that would help me along that path confronted with the pressure of doing something i fervently disliked (and was drawing me away from my creative work, which i missed terribly) i cracked under the pressure and withdrew from the major, the trip i was signed up to go on, and the debate society that everyone thought that i had promise in i ended switching to being an english major and taking a few classes in more creative subjects, like theater it's been hard work catching up on all my classes, but i only ended up falling a year behind, managing to catch a scholarship along the way the time frame still eats at me sometimes when i think about all those accomplished people my age who have already graduated from ivy league schools (i'm at a small state school) and are moving on to better and brighter things than i'll ever even grasp at in my romantic relationships (and my friendships to an extent), i can't seem to set good boundaries without feeling guilty or fearing that i'll be rejected this always causes problems and always hurts everyone involved my last serious relationship went from first date to moving into my parents' house with me within six months, and i lost almost all of my friends from college in the process the relationship consumed my life i'm now out of that relationship, officially, but i haven't been able to move on i still have sex with the same girl, help her out all the time, and feel incapable of getting on with things i can't even tell if i can evaluate her fairly and if getting away from her is a good idea my life feels like an irreconcilable shiatfest and i can't seem to find a good therapist: 3 different counselors in 2 years, and the failed process makes me not want to go back and try again what do i do, reddit? edit: sorry for the botched title, i'm not sure why the text got cut off like that :-/",2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b4vsc/is_there_any_hope_for_me_sorry_for_the/,1266818467

b5ego,depression,throwaway_65535,reddit: i'm a depressed programmer and need help,"hi reddit, i'm going through a tough time at the moment and since i love and trust the reddit community i thought i'd try posting to see what advice fellow redditors can come up with i (was) a software developer and relocated to the sf bay area a year ago from nc (because i'm liberal and atheist) but have failed in the networking department and haven't made any true friends i've *noticed* symptoms of depression in myself for quite awhile now (maybe a year or two) which i think might have been triggered by a relationship breakup a couple years ago but looking back, i've had depressive tendencies my entire life depression is in my family history as well i'm generally shy and always in my head and thinking about hundreds of things, most related to social issues, religion, politics, etc these are things i'm passionate about, though since i know i don't have much control over these things, i've recently put them aside, but replaced them with other pessimistic thoughts regarding my physical health, skillset, my (lack of) career, family, etc i was laid off recently and am now unemployment and of course don't have money to throw at under-skilled psychiatrists, medicines that might not yield the desired outcome, etc one problem that i find myself in, is that due to the nature of my last job, i have a few holes in my skillset they're not major, and i'm a pretty smart guy, but the point is that i need to be able to study, program for fun, and learn some things to make myself more marketable and increase my chances of finding a job this is not something unique to me, as i think i'm a very competent developer compared to some the problem is that due to my mental state i have a very difficult time studying, focusing, conceptualizing and remembering i'm also having a hard time coping with stresses which should be quite normal, and sometimes feel like my brain has quit working, and that i need to sleep in order to reboot my brain i don't exercise and don't eat enough i have quite a bit of knowledge but not much willpower the only way i am able to cope is to do passive things that require no thought, or things like playing video games which are still fun for me and have no associated negative emotions this post is probably tldr and all over the place, but i guess the basic problem is that due to what is probably depression, i'm in somewhat of a downward spiral slowly losing my financial gains, health, friends, my mind, career, etc i don't have family i can turn to, since my parents are very religious and my problems would unnecessarily burden them (and probably make things worse for me rather than better) they might be able to aid me financially if it came to that, but likely not emotionally redditors: i think the main thing that would help me right now is to meet people who can relate to what i've described convential wisdom says that you should hang around people who are the type of people you want to become, but at this point, doing that has failed because those types of people aren't looking to build a relationship with me, and i can no longer relate to them instead i need friends who have gone through the same thing, or friends who are carefree and like to play video games or smoke weed etc basically cool, non-judgemental people this could help me more than any psychologist since it's not information i'm lacking then again, perhaps i do need meds, but i'm not sure it's difficult to explain but basically my friends back home were fun but right-wing, religious, or not intellectual because i had a professional career, everyone i've met in the bay area is intelligent, yet busy and not going to waste time on things i'm interested in i'm a good person and loyal friend, just no longer a high achiever because i feel the need to de-stress as much as possible wtb: hippies thanks, if you've managed to read this far and thanks reddit, just for existing you always give me hope in humanity",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b5ego/reddit_im_a_depressed_programmer_and_need_help/,1266920401

i’ve read just about every reddit post about the friend zone for advice, but… the thing is that i have already done this (twice actually) the first time was back in high school, and i did it all wrong i blamed her for not liking me back and for some reason i thought that guilt tripping her into liking me would work the best part was that i did it all online i’ve chalked that experience up as being a novice person, i’ve grown from it and it definitely taught me a lot about perspective she wouldn’t talk to me for 6 months after that i thought i lost her as a friend blah blah, i grew up and we eventually started talking again and our friendship resumed where it left off the second time was the night before i went off to college (she was a year younger and still in high school) essentially, i just wanted to be able to move on and get her out of my head as she was the only thing on my mind i sat down with her in person and told her she was the most beautiful person i’d ever met, that i was sorry for practically throwing away our friendship earlier, and that if i got a kiss then hopefully i’d be able to move on with my life i got the kiss (woot!), went home, went to college, stayed in fairly good contact with her for the next year, and believed that i was sufficiently cured of her… until she got a boyfriend and i realized just how jealous i was while she was with the boyfriend, she didn’t talk to me as much and was always too busy to hang out (which was to be expected, i know, it was just hard for me to swallow since i wasn’t in a relationship of my own) after he dumped her, we became pretty close again and that’s where we are now anyway, i have interpersonal emotion anxiety issues i find it very difficult to open up to girls and tell them how i feel about them especially in person i’ve done it three times, but i had to psych myself up so much it’s a joke that fear of just putting myself out there is debilitating; it makes me physically sick i’ll forget what i’m saying as i say it and lock up and freeze i discovered this morning that it’s getting even worse like anybody else i exist with a lot of cognitive dissonance, so i’ve convinced myself that it’s ok that i’ll never be with her and that it’s most important to keep her in my life as a friend, despite not truly believing any of that bullshit so after hanging out with her this weekend at her school, i knew she was still down about being dumped, and i just wanted to tell her she was beautiful and that her boyfriend was an idiot for throwing the best thing in his life away, and that everything will be ok (completely platonically i swear!) i psyched myself up for 2 hours this morning to tell her that, and right when the moment of truth came and i was about to say it, i bailed and said goodbye and left to go back to my school i can’t even talk to my friends anymore; the anxiety is so bad getting back to serious matters, i’m almost positive my depression would go away if i got laid by any chick, just something from which to build confidence i just can’t find the motivation to try anymore i’ve had so many close calls fail to pan out, and on top of it, this chick has totally fucked up my head i’m perfectly aware of the self-fulfilling prophecies i am creating for myself, and i think i actually enjoy being caught in the cycle, in some sick cognitively dissonanced way i could never bring myself to commit suicide my mom’s brother died in a car accident before i was born i was told that i was named after my grandfather, but i’m pretty i was actually named after my dead uncle (we all have the same name just to be clear) i cannot imagine how hard that must be to lose someone close to you like that, and i couldn’t bear to do that again to my mom, so that’s ruled out today i realized that this is also the only reason suicide has been ruled out i’m aware how pathetic this sounds literally my only problem is that i have no problems, except the ones i create for myself i’m honestly whineier than holden caulfield, and i’ve been described recently as a curmudgeon oftentimes i wish something horrible had actually happened in my life, so at least i would have a legitimate excuse for wanting people to pity me i know how horrible that is when my dog of 14 years died last year, i was actually comforted by the fact that at least people would feel bad for me (if only for a short while) thank you for reading this i know i just have to get over it, grow a pair, and just get back out there and over my anxiety, but it’s hard pretending to be fine when your head is just a shitstorm of contradictions **tl;dr virgin with anxiety talking to girls, one girl in particular, enjoys being pitied, no real problems in life**",7,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b7p0l/i_am_a_curmudgeon/,1267429426

bgdiu,depression,UsagiMimi,"i'm on a ""vacation"" and really don't want to go home (explanation/recent history inside)","well, i'll start with the present i'm from minnesota, i'm a vacation to meet, well, my girlfriend that i met online, and her friends things are going wonderfully i guess i should explain here that i am transgendered, just because it plays into everything but things are going wonderfully, better than i'd ever imagined she's the first person i've ever known i can honestly say loves me she loves me for everything about me i've had partners in the past, but nothing like this i come from a background of extremely low self esteem from my childhood and other things now, to add to a bit of depression, and i always knew this we could never live together she has two adopted kids and a ""husband "" their relationship is open, he knows about me and everything, but due to adoption services since they originally adopted the kids (whom were her best friends, both died by a drunk driver) when married, adoption services has threatened to take them away if they got divorced, oh, and they've had the kids 4 years now anyways, about 4 years ago, right before i actually moved out on my own for the first time when i was 18 to escape my rather abusive family i was in a car accident the injury wasn't so apparent right away, only a good amount of pain for the first few months then, as i was working and saving for college for the first time, 4 months after the accident i started having job performance issues, i could no longer do my job, due to the pain i was in, and the muscles in my left shoulder got weaker and weaker and weaker, and have left me unable to lift much i was forced to move back home to minnesota, from atlanta, ga, by my medical insurance for further treatment anyway, it was back to my family i got suicidal for a few reasons, and deeply depressed for about two years i couldn't find a job which i could work, the only 2 friends i had, had moved away in the 6 months i was gone (i was homeschooled, so small circle of rl people i ever knew) and yeah, it sucked eventually i was able to open up a small online 3d modeling business, which after a year and a half of building up, brings me about $800 a month which i'm using to pay off debts i gathered, and medical payments since my car insurance dropped medical coverage after $60,000 in diagnostics, physical therapy, etc, didn't help well, this fall, i finally came out to my mother (i never could my father, or i'd lose the only home i have) about being transgendered it didn't go well, but it was tolerated shortly after, my sister, my only sibling alive (my brother died of a drug overdose) got her 3rd dui she is definitely an alcoholic and such the amount of sympathy and support she has gotten my entire life has been astounding in comparison with my own my parents bought her 4 cars, she totaled every one my parents refused to even help with a down payment on my car anyways they've been extremely supportive with her, and over time, my mother has been more and more mentally violent about my transgenderism i finally did get into a clinic specializing in it, and was diagnosed as definitely transgender, things went to hell with her after that because she realized it was a ""phase "" during this time, i met my partner online, and she supported me 100% of the way with everything she's the only one i used saved up flier miles to get round trip plane tickets from mn to oklahoma where she lives, and about a month's income on a cheap, but decent hotel and the rest for two weeks i go back on saturday i've been dreading it, constantly just dreading it, because the entire time i've been here, every stress, almost everything that made me feel depressed every day when i woke up is gone it's just not there for the first time in 4 years i've felt truly happy then tonight, i had a phone call from my mother next monday, i have an appointment with my psychiatrist, which honestly i'll probably need, being back home but my sister goes to court for sentencing for her drunk driving that day, and my mom will be out of town i was called to be notified, i have to go for moral support for her (which if you knew her past with me, violently attacking me, kicking me out of my room when she was drunk, after dragging some guy home at 3 a m in the middle of the night all through my childhood to have sex with in my bed, etc ) you'd understand a little bit of the problem i do love her, and i have supported her but if i miss the appointment with my psychiatrist, the next one isn't for a month, and i already know there are no re-opening reschedules anyhow, i asked her- since recently she's said very hurtful things to me about being different at all, none the less transgendered ""why should she get moral support and i get none, ever?"" her answer was ""she hasn't done anything wrong "" it's her 3rd dui, technically her 5th, but two were over 10 years ago i've never even had a speeding ticket apparently something illegal/being alcoholic &lt; just trying to be myself, and stop being suicidal ranting really helped, sorry for the inconvenience thank you all and yeah, i'm trying to get to move out, but i won't be able to for at least 9 months also, i can't be on disability yet (i've consulted a couple lawyers about it, and i am in a lawsuit over the car accident, but that's going painfully slow the accident was 100% the person's fault who hit me was stopped at a stop light, then rear ended at 40 mph ) again, heh,

bj9aa,depression,throwawayaccount212,i'm on my way to getting what i (think i) want; but yet i feel like shit all the time?,"first up; i do apologise if this is a bit long or whatever, i've never really done this before and i don't really have anywhere to turn, i'm not really sure if there's a pinpoint reason as to why i feel down all the time, so i might just write everything that's happened recently and maybe someone can help me out in saying that, my family's really nice and supportive, but to a point; i have friends but i generally am too big/eccentric when we hang out so it's kinda hard to turn around and be all serious/deep i've been brought up around computers, had the internet when i was young and have pretty much loved computers/video games for as long as i can remember, and as such, i'm in my 2nd year of studying bachelor of computer science and am aspiring to be a programmer/game developer when that's all done i recently just came off a 4-5 year addiction to world of warcraft (3 weeks clean after raiding 5-6 nights a week) and with that, i was wanting to focus on my uni work and get the grades i deserved -- as in previous semesters, i'd be 1-3 marks off getting into the next band (credit/distinction/highdistinction) and always getting bummed about it, and especially leaving things to the last minute because i prioritised wow/video games over my uni work the thing is, this all seems fine on paper; i'm also unemployed with no licence/car, which does bother me at times, and it could be a contributing factor as to why i feel like shit, but i'm not sure the point of this (and that made me write this in the first place) is the fact that i currently have programming assignments, in the same language as the industry standard, in the situation that if i nail these and do well, i could turn around and put it in my portfolio and start building myself up as a programmer so when i'm done at uni i can kickstart my career; and yet i feel like i should be excited to do it, because i'd get crucial experience in doing what i love well, thats the thing i'm not sure anymore i've spent the past 2 days procrastinating even though it's due in like 4 days i seriously can't be bothered doing it, and it's been the same for every other programming assignment i've recieved in the past 2-3 years i should be excited because this is what i've told people and what i've believed i want to do for the rest of my life, and yet i'm already predicting i'll be doing this up until the due date/hour i believe this is a main part of why i feel like shit, but lately i haven't really had the energy to do anything; yesterday i woke up relatively early (10-11), watched tv for a few hours, moped around on reddit/facebook/youtube for a few hours, watched more tv, ate food then went back to bed this is pretty much how my days have been going, with the exception of dragging myself to uni 4 days a week; all the while i think i should be excited (or at least wanting) to do this uni work which is essentially what i'm aiming to do in a real company in just 2+ years from now another contributing factor (i imagine): my uncle did compuer science, at the same university, and went on to travel across the world (australia -&gt; usa) to work at a highly prestigious company and i used to look up to him, thinking that i would complete my degree (maybe with honours) then look at making the same jump to work in such companies; however he recently passed away, which, to be quite honest, sucks i wanted to sit down with him and ask him about life after uni in this field and everything (sadly; we weren't able to meet up irl that much due to the whole ""other side of the world"" thing), and especially after going through the funeral and all that, and thanks to family/friends, i started to realise that i bare great resemblance to him, which makes it hard because the option of contacting him one way or another was there before, and i imagine i would have used that in great depth later on, but having that taken away makes it difficult i'm sorry if this is long, and seems a bit merit less compared to other people here, but i just want someone to tell me that it's kind of normal to experience this throughout uni/college i haven't told anyone, and i'm starting to think my parents are thinking i'm just lazy, but i seriously can't be fucked doing anything anymore; i'm not sure if it's because i killed a 4-5 year wow addiction cold turkey, or if it's the fact that my uncle passed away in which having him around could have helped me get through some of this, i don't know this might be a dead end, i'm not sure, but i'm hoping someone will read this and be able to help me from what i gather from the people on reddit (especially /r/depression + /r/suicidewatch) is that you guys/girls are incredibly nice :)",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj9aa/im_on_my_way_to_getting_what_i_think_i_want_but/,1269768943

bjg67,depression,itsfakenameyouknow,"i think i have found the source and or triggers for my depression, and i need your advice","right off the bat i will say the negative factor in my life is my father so here is the basic background story i lived with my mother up until college and the divorce was before i can remember then for college i moved in with my father because he lives near my uni living with him isn't the worst thing ever read as: he doesn't beat me he is gone during the week, but calls all the time to have me do silly shit for him on weekends he comes home and usually want some help with a project i don't mind helping him, but he is very short tempered being 62 years old he is frugal, petty and just obnoxious i feel sorry for him at many point because he is very angry at the world and there is no way i can help him he blames other people for everything, and something rarely, if ever, his fault all he does is watch soccer and old tv shows he is stuck in the 1970s (yes, i'm aware that it appears i am blaming him for my problems, but i am doing so with this explanation and i am attempting a realistic portrayal of events plus he doesn't directly cause most problems, he just makes them worse with his outlook ) problems in life only really affect me more than normal when my dad is involved sometimes after an argument i will be so stressed and just have to cry or do something to distract myself and i can't get schoolwork done he will be petty and overthink things which wastes my time plus i do not want to end up old, bitter, and friendless as he is the only perk to living with him is that rent is free i have been living with him for 2 years and it is getting slightly worse, although we were never really good at any point would i be better off getting a student apartment at ~$400 a month (which i can probably afford, probably without taking out loans) or should i suck it up, get over it, and hope he doesn't kick me out? thanks reddit! just typing that out has helped me quite a lot",7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bjg67/i_think_i_have_found_the_source_and_or_triggers/,1269818235

bkel1,depression,depressedsoul,i am so lost,"as far back as i can remember i have always been sad i may not have always looked sad or depressed because i spent most of my life living a lie i have always pretended to be fine, when deep down i was wallowing in misery i am 24 years old, and have been struggling with depression most of my life i feel as if every time i reach a peak from climbing out of depression, i fall down a valley the valleys seem to get deeper and deeper each time each time i think i hit rock bottom, but now i feel worse than ever i regret most of my life, and i am not at peace with almost anything i have ever done the only thing that i am happy with was preventing some random girl who i had just met from killing herself in front of me i felt her pain, and told her not to give up i loved her for the brief time i knew her and truthfully that was the only time i had a really deep connection with anyone i am so lost i have been living a lie for so long i have only been in school because that's where i thought i should be, but it's not where i want to be i want to backpack and travel but i feel as though i am going to destroy that path as i did with everything else the person that people think they know is also a lie i have been acting most of my life, and no one really knows me, they have only had peeks at who i am if you feel like reading a lot, here is a bit of a backstory of my life: things took a turn for the worse when i was about 13 my parents were constantly arguing as far back as i can remember, and my father was prone to smashing and breaking things during those fights well one morning i awoke to screaming and banging i told my younger sister to stay in the room while i went to assess the situation i immediately discovered my parents literally fighting, fists were flying my father proceeded to headbutt my mom, breaking her nose they immediately saw me standing there watching in horror my mother grabs me as she tells me to protect to her, that's the first time that i saw real fear in someone's eyes i tell my father to get the fuck out of the here and look at what you did i push him down my front stairs that day seemed to be the day that i became broken i was fractured in so many places and became disillusioned i realized that the world was such an ugly place something inside of me began to change i began to act out on the ugliness, and i eventually came to actually enjoy it i gave up on excelling at school, while regularly stealing and vandalizing anything i began drinking at a young age even though my father was an alcoholic but none of this was internal, it was all an external reaction my real problems began to manifest with sex and masturbation by the time i was fifteen i had pretty much got off to every type of porn there was and frequenting perverse chatrooms when i wasn't destroying or stealing outside, i was destroying myself inside i had become a sex addict, and at the same time i hated myself for it i barely graduated high school due to barely attending i then grew a lump in my chest, which was later proved benign, and i thought it was breast cancer i hid it until it became excruciatingly painful after the surgery, i isolated myself to my room for a year and a half while playing an mmorpg and masturbating to all types of disgusting shit i eventually broke out and tried to reinvent myself i became more outgoing and started dating, each time i failed how could someone love me if i could not love myself? i then enrolled in a local college, and at the same time became somewhat of a fitness freak with my newly obtained fit body, i began seeking random sex with people off of craigslist and adultfriendfinder while i was doing well at school, i spent the rest of my time seeking sex from anyone and everyone by the time i was 22, i had been with every gender, male, female, transguys and transgirls, and even couples none of it made me feel any better, in fact it made me feel even worse over the course of a couple of months, i had two breakdowns both times my body was acting on its own yelling random garbage while my consciousness was somewhere else the first time i was hospitalized because i broke into a random basement and punched through a window my friends later saw me running down the street with blood gushing down my arm i ""awoke"" tied down to a hospital bed, watching myself continue to yell random garbage until i regained control over myself to this day, i still try to remember what i experienced and the closest i can come to explaining it is that they were both similar to salvia trips that lasted hours i eventually transferred to a state college where my sex addiction took the backseat to drinking i became friends with heavy drinkers and partiers i was drinking almost everyday i then proceeded to get kicked off campus, and eventually failed out i moved back in with my parents and i began to hate them i realized they are nothing but overgrown children who should have never had a child, let alone three children i began to have panic attacks and was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder i was prescribed clonazepam and prozac but i didn't have health insurance and couldn't afford to keep up with the medication at the same time i developed a serious paranoia of people talking behind my back i thought i was becoming schizophrenic but i found out that my family thought i had a coke problem (i have only done coke twice in my life) eventually the panic attacks stopped, and i transferred to an art school while at the same time moving out of my parent's house i am now on a leave of absence from school, while seeking therapy i am now taking celexa along with clonazepam while diagnosed with bipolar ii my sex addiction is back, and i struggle with it everyday i am unemployed and i try hard to occupy myself with other tasks i read constantly but sometimes my thoughts become so overwhelming that i cannot concentrate i also have days where i spontaneously binge drink for the past two years i have been smoking weed regularly and to me it is the only thing that has kept me going when i am not high, i am agitated, depressed, angry and really sad i am writing all this now because i just broke down crying while i was in the shower tl;dr i basically lived a life of constant self loathing i am a sex addict who is known to use other substances as an escape edit: i never mentioned that i was a guy",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bkel1/i_am_so_lost/,1269990051

bluzw,depression,downwardspiral22,college graduation: feeling immeasurably lonely and unstable,"i'm a senior at college, and as i'm about to graduate i notice everyone is filled with profound happiness as they spend their last couple of weeks with their close friends with whom they've forged great friendships with over these past four years i don't have that i don't know why i've tried hard to be a social person throughout college i've met a great amount of people, but i never went past the acquaintance phase the people i did choose to be my close friends are now complete degenerates who do nothing but play video games all day and all night i want to desperately go out and socialize and meet new people, so i contact these friends who are in such tight-knit social circles but when i join them, it just feels odd they are so close with each other and have so many inside-jokes that i just don't feel welcome i always get the feeling that i am just tagging along, and so i don't want to put any further pressure on these friends to bring me along this isn't so bad in the winter time, when it's shitty out and i'm studying all the time anyway with the recent spring weather, however, it's unbearable i go to a school in a big city, so as i walk down the street i just see a ton of people (all my age, or a little older) just having a grand old time drinking in the outdoor restaurants, holding hands, just having a great time this kills me this reminds me of when i was graduating high school, when the same exact feelings came over me i had made a lot of friends throughout high school, and throughout my sophomore and junior years but by senior year it seemed like everyone became closer friends behind my back and i was just the constant outcast i realize this isn't really true, but it's just how i feel i can't explain it, but now i don't see any of my friends from high school anymore i don't even bother, because i don't consider them friends i don't enjoy my time with them the same can be said for the vast majority of people i've met in college i never got to know them well enough (which is my fault) and so i don't know them well enough to have that close bond, and thus i can't share those warm, glorious feelings of the college days winding down all i have are close friends who play video games all day, who were not like this a year ago this is what i come home to, and this is what i end up in the presence of it takes a supreme toll on me, because it just makes me depressed i don't even play video games with them, but i just feel immeasurably depressed i feel lonely and unstable, and i have never felt this bad before in my life i don't want to do anything at this point i can't read anything, watch anything, smoke anything, eat anything, or talk to anyone i don't know what to do i may have depression, and i am considering talking to my doctor about this but i can't see him until monday i also have exams this week which is freaking me out i just don't know what to do, and i just want someone to talk to me anyone say something please",8,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bluzw/college_graduation_feeling_immeasurably_lonely/,1270263897

bmzhl,depression,big_manjini,"please, help i'm 28, depressed, and running out of hope i don't want to","to start with, yes, there is going to be a lot of text i'm getting some stuff off my chest, but i also want to be as explicit as possible so that anyone who might have something relevant to share, no matter how small, can do it i realize i'm asking you a big favor in getting through this wall of text but i'd really appreciate it only problem is that it's a super long typed up thing, so i apparently need to chop it into parts, so please refer to the comments for the rest of it the summary is this: i'm a 28 year old virgin, relatively successful, relatively in shape, who has plenty to look forward to and still has things he enjoys in life, but who is losing a battle against a crippling inferiority complex and the resulting depression my best theory for the origins of my issues are as follows: i grew up in the rural midwest in a town of about 1,000 people my family was something of a local dynasty with a reputation, established over several generations, of being handsome local sports stars i realize now how meaningless it sounds to be a small town sports hero, but the world i grew up in felt a lot smaller in a town of 1,000 people, being a local sports star is about as close to celebrity as you can get the signs welcoming you to town proudly list all the years we managed to take state championship in each sport ask anyone in town about their home team, and their chest would swell with pride as they recounted tales of battles won against schools ten times our size to bring the state championship home again one of my uncles was a 3 time state champion wrestler and set several records at the state level in football my father was similar athletically successful and had since become assistant coach of the hometown wrestling team these men, among others, started off a new generation of the dynasty with a bang: though i had no brothers, i had plenty of cousins -- there were six other boys within four years of age of me who shared my family name most of those boys grew to fulfill the family reputation nicely it started with blue ribbons in pee-wee wrestling and ended with year after year of state championships in football all across the state these strapping young lads had the heart of many a high school girl wrapped around their finger, a couple of them so remarkably handsome that it wasn't uncommon to catch out of town girls giggling over them as though they were the cover to tiger beat this newest generation of the dynasty seemed to be the best one yet and as you likely already guessed, i didn't exactly fit in with these other six it's not that we weren't close -- we were a tight knit family we grew up together, i was exceptionally close to most of them, and they are still among my best friends but as we grew older they took to sports pretty naturally and were celebrated by the entire town and family they were also nice guys overall, polite and well behaved they were even multi-talented and excelled in band and choir, taking home state awards regularly i, on the other hand, had interests elsewhere i did sports to fit in, but never enjoyed it much (and sometimes flat out wanted to quit) i also did music, and genuinely enjoyed that, but i never had the natural talent for it my cousins did i was much more interested in computers, technology, video games, public speaking, acting, storytelling, and fantasy novels at some of these things i excelled -- in grade school i was teased for my insatiable appetite for all things nintendo, in high school i had a reputation as the go-to computer guy and my typing speed seemed to be a novelty to my peers but i was rather homely in appearance and sometimes outright embarrassing at sports, and it wasn't long before my ""black sheep"" reputation proceeded me i want to stress that while teenagers could be cruel about it, my family most certainly wasn't i never got on all that well with my father, but it wasn't because he was cruel to me it's just that we had no common ground -- he was born and raised a farmer in a small town, and he was content in everything that life had to offer he enjoyed the home town sports games and watching football on sunday he believed in hard work and the character of manual labor and being in the sun i honestly had very little interest in sports and wanted to instead by spending every moment i could in front of the computer he hated to see me in front of the computer and so i grew up being afraid of getting ""caught"" using the home computer (after we were able to afford one of our own, anyways) that's all getting a little off course -- the point is that i grew up relatively happy, but unsurprisingly developed a kind of inferiority complex though a few girls showed interest in me in my younger days, it never amounted to anything more than making out, and i always felt out of place in my own family through no fault of their own and so when i entered college in 1999, it was as an insecure, poorly dressed, and not particularly attractive computer science major i wish i could say i got out of my family's shadow, but that's not true either -- during my four years of higher education, five of those six cousins were playing college ball for my college or one

bo3pt,depression,FluffyBunnikins,i need to seek help (uk) and i'm not sure where to start,"i'm male, 26 and i've been depressed for as long as i can remember there are many reasons for this - i'd like to believe that these are all to do with the many years of severe emotional abuse i've had to deal with, but it's possible that there is more to it i have very rarely sought help, in any fashion certainly no-one would help me when i was younger the most important event was almost two years ago, when i finally went to see a gp he was incredibly rude, did not listen at all, kept interrupting my sentances and telling me that there was nothing wrong with me - essentially that i was wasting his time that spun me out for a few months, and i've only started to bring up enough courage to try something like that again since then my unhappiness and lack of basic social ability (such as making eye contact - it physically hurts on occasion) has cost me jobs and relationships, the last of those was two days ago, when a girl i love more than anything, and i've been seeing for almost a year, suddenly told me she doesn't want to see me again, as my occasional bouts of misery were making her even more miserable i'm also due to be made redundant in a couple of months, and i'm worried that i won't be able to land a new job, since i come across so appallingly in interviews i honestly don't know where to go for help i don't have a lot of money, and i'm very against the idea of medication (again, for a lot of reasons, some of them historical) if going to a gp is going to be anything like as painful as before, then i don't think i can stand it i don't think i'm a suicide risk the thought of it has always been there, but it's more comforting than anything - it's a possible exit when there doesn't seem to be any, so it can be put aside and other options can be considered what are my options? i'm finding it very hard to think straight right now, obviously, and i've never done this kind of thing before",10,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bo3pt/i_need_to_seek_help_uk_and_im_not_sure_where_to/,1270726131

bubik,depression,merrythoughts,i am on my 9th day of taking prozac (fluoxetine) i have some questions about it,"first off, i'm an rn, so i've already accessed all the resources i can get my hands on i just want to hear real people's ideas and experiences background: i've been feeling unwell for eight months now, with nothing showing up on diagnostic tests i started feeling depressed and hopeless, as i'm only 26 and have always felt very healthy and energetic this has been stressful for my husband, family, and me i had urges to run away from it all i also have had general anxiety-- getting some panic attacks here and there, but mostly just always ruminating about my mystery illness and wondering, ""am i dying from some obscure cancer?"" current problem: i got a 'script for prozac, and i started taking it i am a over one week into it, and i have had terrible paresthesia of my feet/ankles the last four days when i walk too long, my toes tingle, but when i lay down in bed, i have **hot, stabbing pain** this has kept me from sleeping the last three nights, and my anxiety has sky-rocketed i had a dr appointment to talk about the paresthesia, but, ended up having the *worst* panic attack ever right there in the waiting room embarrassing, and plus, i fear that it invalidates my whole health history, as the doctor will now brush all my symptoms off as being part of my anxiety (i realize this is a possibility, but i want to keep checking things off the list ) he gave me my first prescription ever of xanax and has me coming in to do some lab work tomorrow questions: 1)anybody else experience paresthesia (tingling, prickling, numbness) in the legs or arms after beginning an ssri? 2) anybody else have a major increase in anxiety after beginning an ssri? 3) if so, did these side effects go away after a few days, or did they persist? 4) i was prescribed both lexapro and prozac, as i wanted to chose which one i started after doing my own personal research i chose prozac, as the side effects didn't seem as severe has anybody had a good experience with lexapro? or, a good experience with switching from prozac to lexapro? i realize paresthesia, increased anxiety, etc can indeed be side effects, but, i'm trying to figure out if i should stay on it and see what happens, or get off it entirely, or try lexapro instead i'm not sure if my mood/irritability has improved since being on prozac yet, as i've been too anxiety ridden to know so those who have a history with ssris, i would love some insight with your personal experiences thank you! **tl;dr- what were your side effects from taking prozac/lexapro/other ssris?** **edit**: i took a xanax, and the paresthesia is gone, which is good news i'm thinking that prozac might just be exacerbating my anxiety way more than the average individual",24,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bubik/i_am_on_my_9th_day_of_taking_prozac_fluoxetine_i/,1271887999

buziz,depression,[deleted],a question to people who have overcome their depression,"a little background info on where this question stems from i've had depression for a number of years now and have only once tried to do anything about it i went to a psychiatrist and was put on prozac i started taking it and after a few weeks i started to feel genuinely happy i wasn't just wallowing in a ball of self misery for the first time in my life i felt optimistic about the days coming and this scared me even though i was happy, i was longing for the feeling of depression that i had become so accustomed to i assume that i had made depression my 'comfort zone' and i wanted to keep it that way i quit taking the drugs and for the next few years just did nothing but be depressed which lead to me being a complete hermit that's another story though today i started taking the prozac again to hopefully help get my life in order and deal with my anxiety and depression as weird as it may sound, i actually *like* being depressed i just feel more of myself when i'm completely down and i usually put on music that increases the feelings of depression what i want to know is, have any other redditors that have started taking something for their depression felt uncomfortable being happy and wished to be depressed again? if so how were you able to overcome those feelings? please excuse the horrendous lack of flow in the above writing was never my forte",9,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/buziz/a_question_to_people_who_have_overcome_their/,1272004819

bzopk,depression,splashit,"hey reddit, what's going on with me?","throw away here's lists of things i feel like are problems i feel like i was depressed in high school, but got over it completely in college however, for the last few months i notice that my mood fluctuates all the time, and often for little good reason i can be the happiest person around one minute, and then suddenly fall into a mopey stupor that takes a night's sleep to get out of i don't feel that i have a ton of reasons to be depressed my family is financially stable, i attend a top-10 university (freshman) and am not having huge trouble with school i have friends unfortunately, sometimes i find myself being a total dick to my friends when i'm in a bad mood (again, often the source of the bad mood is either miniscule or nonexistant) an example of something that pissed me off happened less than 20 minutes ago i was talking on the phone with my mother, and she used the expression ""when push comes to shove,"" which is one of her go-to expressions this might sound stupid but my parents' mannerisms are very predictable and bother me a whole lot i was tempted to let out a noise and throw the phone against the wall entirely because she said that one phrase yeah i definitely have some family issues i'm an only child, and i've noticed that at college, while other people talk about their families a lot, i rarely do about a week ago, one of my close friends asked me to talk about my family i did, and started feeling queasy and pissed off as i did so eventually another one of my friends cut in with something about her own family and i blew up, saying that she shouldn't have interrupted me sometimes i have a horrible temper, other times i can be incredibly patient i am *never* in a good mood when i speak to my parents, and if they call, when i answer the phone it gets rid of my good mood, if i was in one my dad yelled a lot, and would get angry at me for stuff i never thought was a big deal one memory that just now popped into my head was during a piano recital years and years ago-- i must have been 8? i had to play *la cucaracha* i messed up playing, and was really embarrassed i tried again and messed up extremely embarrassed, i just went back to my seat without finishing the song it was ok at the recital, but once we got away from other people, my dad freaked out on me this is how it usually goes he's nice when any other people are around, but freaks out when it's just me or my mom and i then he tries to apologize by saying he didn't mean it but the damage is always already done another memory is during christmas eve, when the fireplace flue clogged and the room filled with smoke my dad yelled to the point that i ran to my room and locked the door, stayed there crying while hearing him yelling downstairs i can never go anywhere on a trip with my dad, because he finds the smallest things to get pissed off at like we're running a little late for something unimportant or the guy in front of us in the car lane isn't moving quickly enough and i'm afraid that i'm turning into this, which i hate i don't smoke weed regularly now, but i would smoke a couple times a week since about a year ago everything seemed fine, although one time a couple months ago i had a panic attack from it my mind moved incredibly fast and i freaked out, having no one to talk me out of it i took a break from smoking, then did it twice more with normal results the third time since the first panic attack i had another, worse panic attack it was a total freakout three or maybe three hundred literal *eternities* passed in 12 minutes i started thinking bad stuff, came to the conclusion that the universe was a cosmic joke, and while i saw the irony, i still hated it i feel like there's some real anxiety problems associated with/caused by these experiences also, i stopped going out to parties, etc i had a girlfriend for a while, we broke up, and i was fine, but then somehow i just stopped going out haven't seen any play lately another thing i hate myself for getting pissed off at is one of my good friends she has a long-distance boyfriend who she has basically invested her entire life into she talks to him every night online i was fine having to hear about it before, albeit thinking it silly, but i started getting attracted to her after maybe 4 months of knowing her and now it pisses me off to no end when she talks about him, considering he just isn't around i know this is stupid and petty, something i need to get over, but right now it just isn't happening and it sends me into a bad mood i'm going to see a counselor tomorrow sorry for the long read, and i welcome any and all comments",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bzopk/hey_reddit_whats_going_on_with_me/,1272941209

c02nx,depression,ArmageddonAardvark,an undelivered letter to my wife,"a simple, 6 minute phone call today finally pushed me over the edge; it may be the best thing that has ever happened to me for the first time, i am finally able to articulate all the problems i've been dealing with for the last several months i've spent the last 4 hours crying, and writing a letter to my wife outlining everything below is what came out ***** **tl;dr - i don't feel my wife respects me, which has made me angry/resentful/jealous of her success ** *why am i always so angry? so tired? so depressed?* i feel trapped every day i go to a job i hate every afternoon i pick up our son every evening i sit on the couch, alone, waiting for you to come home **i feel like a live-in housekeeper/nanny with a part-time day job; i feel that's how you see me too ** you love me, of that i have no doubt you appreciate the things i do but i don't think you **respect** me how can you? i don't even respect myself i'm not successful like you i don't have an important job like you i don't have friends like you i don't have a life of my own, i play a supporting role in yours i'm entirely dependent on you if you were to leave me, i'd have nothing i'm all debt and no future i'd be another 30-something, living at home in my parent's basement because i couldn't make it on my own, again *so why all the anger?* i'm not mad at you, i'm jealous every night when you get home late, it's a reminder that i have a worthless job every text messages you get is a reminder that i have no friends left why do i get mad when you spend all day and night texting people from work? because it feels like you're trying to escape, that you feel trapped too when you finally get home, then spend half the night talking with other people, it feels like you'd rather spend time with them you **respect** them they have important jobs **they live the life you want, the life you know you'll never have with me ** i don't care that you talk to friends, or that you stop by the bar to hang out for a few minutes on the way home i'm not mad at you, i'm dissatisfied with my own life, and seeing that you'd rather be with them only adds to my depression *""what about you?"", you'll ask you go to the bars with friends i've never met, and always seem more excited, more talkative, happier, when other people come to house * that is all true but do you know why? **it's because those people see me the way i see you ** they think **i'm** successful they are jealous of **my** life they respect **me** for those few hours, every couple of months, i respect myself *why haven't you told me about this?* * i didn't know i had a vague idea of what's been eating at me for months, but couldn't quite identify what specifically was wrong * i don't know how i've started to tell you a dozen times but because i didn't know that the problem lay with me, i blamed you i resented you for having the life i wanted, and instead of talking about it, i attacked it * i don't know why you can't fix this i don't know if i can fix this you once told me about a conversation you had regarding your attitude toward a coworker you don't respect him your manager said she didn't want you to feel that way you said you'd work with him, that you would get along with him, but that you couldn't change how you felt about him just because she wanted you to that's how i feel i could tell you, but no matter how much you want it, i can't change how i think you feel about me * because i'm afraid if i tell you how i feel, the idea is now in your head you'll deny it of course you'll tell me all the reasons why you love me you'll list all the things i've accomplished but that idea will be in your head you'll fight it you'll try to come home earlier for a week or two you'll say you'll stop talking/texting people when you're at home but it won't last even if it did, it won't matter **i can't get happiness by taking your's away ** you'll try to find me a new job you'll look at websites, and ask for my resume to send to a friend of a friend but nothing will come of it, and that idea will still be in your head one day you'll wake up and realize that i'm right you'll realize that you'll never be have the life you want with me you'll realize that there are guys, guys whom you respect, who are just waiting for an opportunity to be with you you'll finally decide that you have to do what's right for you, and that means leaving the guy who's holding you back, leaving me i'll understand because i know i'm the one holding you back from all the things you want in life i can't be mad, because i'm the one who put that idea in your head in the first place *will a new job make you happy?* i've worked jobs i hated before, so why the urgency now? why the desperation to find something new? while it's true i hate my job, this time is different this time i'm not trying to run away from something i don't like, but toward something else i feel that a new job, a **better** job, will make all the other problems disappear if i only made more money, if i only had a more impressive title, if i only worked in a position **you respected**, then i would have no reason to be resentful/jealous of you but the truth is, that is never going to happen any position i'm offered would mean giving up all the things we love about my job; the schedule, the paid time off, the benefits to make up for that, i'd have to get more money than i'm worth i've spent too long in a job too far from my desired field i simply don't have the skills or experience to do anything else i don't even think i have it in me to keep trying it's not the rejection that hurts it's that with each new application, i convince myself that this is the one i **believe** that i've finally found the job of which we can both be proud each time, i build my expectations higher than the last, and each rejection means i'm falling further, falling harder than the previous i'm tired, i'm broken, and i'm beaten i don't think i can go through it again *so what do we do now?* i don't know i need to finally accept that this is my life once i do that, maybe i can re-define what a successful life, what fulfilling life, means to me maybe then i'll be able to appreciate my life for what it is perhaps happiness isn't getting what you want, it's wanting what you have i don't know that i'll ever stop being jealous of you i don't know that i'll ever shake this feeling that you don't respect me as you said, you can't change how you feel, no matter how much someone wants you to feel differently **but i'm trying** ***** if anyone made it to this point, thank you i want to be clear though, i'm not looking for sympathy, for solidarity, or for suggestions i *will* talk to my wife sooner rather than later i'm just just home alone today, and really needed an outlet to get this off my chest so really, thank you &lt;/rant&gt;",5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c02nx/an_undelivered_letter_to_my_wife/,1273001457

my mother lied not only was i now forced to live with a brother who actually wanted me dead my parents ignored me and told everyone i was mentally ill my sister who i was extremely close to and gave me the only good childhood memories i had was now treating me like a stranger now at this point my memories get hazy, between 12 and 16 i know what happened but i cant remember the time lines after coming home like that i stopped caring, about everything just like the day i stopped talking i started cutting myself in my arm, i stopped eating, i started drugs and alcohol and pick up bad boyfriends because i thought they would love me i was admitted a few times for trying to kill myself and from age 14 to 16 i lived almost non stop in a mental hospital i watched friends die to the same things i was doing and still i couldn't stop myself when i was 16 the head psychiatrist called me into his office i had never seen him before but suddenly he wanted to see me he sat me down i will never forget what he first words he said to me: you are going to die there was little no emotions in his face and he said it clean and simple ""you are going to die, you are so self destructive that one day you will just drop dead i guess you've showed your parents then uh?"" i left his office without saying anything and the first thought that popped in my head was: i don't want to die! i threw away my drugs and my scale and started eating again it took me a few more months but i eventually also stopped cutting in myself 6 months later i left the hospital i never realised i wasn't cured yet and still all my emotions blocked i started a relationship with laurens the first year was a dream so happy was i he loved me and cared for me and he seemed so ""mature"" after that year and i moved in with him he started to change he started saying things like how he would cheat on me if i didn't have sex with him that night and how horrible i was to live with and how lucky i was that he would even conciser putting up with me that was also the year that the dockters told me i have fibromyalgie a condition that causes me to be in a lot of pain 2 years later he destroyed every little piece of self worth i had left i was nothing a empty shell, just sleeping, trying not to feel the pain one day we got into a fight and he had pushed me around before but this was different his eyes were filled with rage i only just ducked the fist that was coming after me and as soon as i realised what happened something inside me snapped all the anger of all the years of the things that happened in my life seemed to come to this point i raised my head and looked deep into his eyes i told him i was not afraid of him and he needed to leave, right now! just like that day when i was 12 and went to the police, i don't know how i found the courage to do it, but i did he cried, he begged, he got angry, he told me i was nothing without him, then he cried some more and eventually left",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c7p6s/one_hell_of_a_ride/,1274740474

cawm1,depression,Worthless_Useless,i need advice,"tl;dr: i'm a depressed, spoiled brat who is too dumb to realize how good he has it, and instead is paranoid that everyone wants him to go away this is my first thing to ever post to reddit (i've been lurking for a long time), but i am at the end of my rope, and i need an audience to hear me please forgive me if my writing is a little scattered i have an awesome family who has supported me emotionally and financially on many occasions (i am living with my parents right now while i am working on my masters degree) i am in no financial trouble, i live in a wealthy area of town, i have never gone wanting for anything that i needed however, i am incredibly depressed (hence the whole posting to /r/depression) the fact that i'm not just giddy with how fortunate i am frustrates me, and makes me feel like i'm just a spoiled brat however, i think that most of my trouble stems from the fact that i view myself as an abject failure i used to say that my one redeeming quality was my intelligence (that is, the only thing that i had that i could be proud of was my intelligence) however, even that is falling away as it's looking like i'm going to finish my master's thesis a year after i had initially planned my schoolwork is essentially destroying the one pillar of strength that i used to be able to lean on for most of my life, i have been several years behind my age group socially being fat, depression, adhd, and overall nerdiness have contributed to me being a social outcast for my childhood and teenage years at some point, i became so frustrated with this, that i essentially started treating social interactions like a puzzle i would find out some way that i was screwing up in social interactions, or something that was causing me to repel people, and i would make a note to avoid doing that thing over the years, this has resulted in my now being what one would consider socially normal, but also entirely generic in any social situation, i spend all my effort to ensure that i don't step on any toes, that i don't say anything offensive, that i don't say anything inappropriate, and this has not only turned all social situations into events that are exhausting and frustrating, but also has resulted in a large portion of my identity being hidden from people who know me (or at least think they do) i know there are ""friends"" i have that are always depressed and don't ever hide it, and they completely drain me eventually, no one wants to be around someone who is always miserable therefore, i go through significant efforts to make sure that almost no one knows how depressed i really am, because i don't want to lose the few friends i do have because i'm always such a downer in addition, i know there are people who are drawn to me but who also exhaust me they just drain me emotionally, as i am always trying to be nice to them, but i wish i never had to deal with them and that they would just go away my natural inclination is to assume that anyone that i actually do want to be around feels this way about me i basically live my life assuming that i am a burden to all people that i care about, and that they would be better off and even prefer if i just disappeared all in all, i feel like no one would ever want to be around me if i actually let the real me show (i e , the depressed me) i feel like i have nothing special to offer anyone in any relationship (friendship or romantic) especially from the romantic standpoint, i have reasonably high standards from what i want from a girl (not unrealistic, but certainly enough to eliminate a lot of women) i see no reason why any woman who meets these standards would be interested in a guy who is such a neurotic mess i see no value in myself, and i feel like i have nothing to offer anyone else, so i basically assume that i'll never get a real romantic relationship with the kind of woman that i desire i am not withdrawing from social situations on the contrary, i can't stand to be by myself anymore, so i find something to do almost every night i play several sports, run occasionally, and do other social interactions however, even hanging out with many people, i feel lonely and rejected i am getting to a breaking point where i am starting to put myself at risk of physical harm (i am punching things, and slamming my head against things) i feel like i am an abject failure, and the only reason that i wouldn't seriously consider suicide is because i don't want to let down my family and people that actually do care about me however, i am rapidly going downhill, and i simply need advice i can't approach the people that actually know me because i don't want to be rejected, so i'm appealing to you, reddit please forgive me for submitting such a long-winded post (my verbosity is among the many things that cause me to be a social outcast) i will try to answer any questions that you have for me, but i must be going to bed soon, so i will attempt to answer tomorrow (i have no clue how quickly/slowly responses actually come in for these types of subreddits) thank you in advance for any help update: i have visited with the school counselor and will begin therapy twice a week with him in addition, i am taking the steps to move out of my parents' place an into my own apartment, which i am getting

cd4o8,depression,tooanxious,"terribly anxious, seeking advice concerning personal motivation and ideas for improvement","note: i apologize for the length i have had anxiety since i was a child, as well as panic attacks during school i developed a high amount of social anxiety because i was terrified to humiliate myself - this began around 3rd grade and is still a problem as a college student i might consider myself bipolar but i have never been properly diagnosed no one knows about my issues because my family has the belief that psychology is another way to steal your money, and every friend i told decided i was lying in order to garner attention i have even had a close friend who had gone through therapy for his anxiety tell me that i should just, ""get over it "" so, basically what i'm saying is that i'm terrified to tell anyone, especially at a professional level when i did try to muster the courage to tell an authority figure (my guidance counselor in high school) she gave me the sage advice to ""participate in class more"" and that was the end of it i am bitter, i suppose the people i do know who have experienced anxiety and depression have such a huge sense of entitlement to their ""issues"" that they disregard everyone else's problems as silly compared to theirs i am older now, and i am going back to college in the fall i have to pay for school myself and i have no money for a therapist even if i did have the opportunity, i don't think i would have the courage - i feel like at this point i have completely sealed myself off from talking to anyone about it i am extremely paranoid when it comes to talking to others, and i have the terrible problem of assuming people are always trying to make fun of me, humiliate me, or insult me i think having a therapist would be the ultimate of my worst fears as such, i'd like to know if there are ways that i can help myself without the use of professional help or medication this may sound silly, but i know that if i didn't clarify, the number one answer will be ""seek help"" which i am unable to do, for financial reasons as well as personal ones i won't do it i am not at the right place in my life i am not suicidal my university has free counseling sessions, which i can take advantage of if i so choose since i know someone will recommend exercising, know that i have anxiety to the point that i cannot and will not work out anywhere out of my home, unless it's a quick stroll on the street if there are too many people outside i get anxious and paranoid when i was in my teens, i was terrified of becoming fat to the point of having anxiety attacks over it, and i developed what i choose to self-diagnose as an exercise obsession, eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown of sorts - an anxiety attack that lasted for many hours and left me jittery and nervous for a month because of this i am very afraid of heavy exercise and tend to get very nervous doing so i have tried yoga, which i enjoy, but it has not helped my mental state i had a lot of time on my hands one summer so i spent it doing yoga for 2 hours a day for 2 months i felt very flexible, but my interactions with other people as well as my paranoia had not diminished of course if i still experienced such strong panic attacks i would probably look into medical help, but for 2 years they have mysteriously disappeared however, i have not noticed an improvement in my mental state because of this i understand that it may sound as if i don't want to improve or help myself, especially considering my aversion to professional treatment i am worried that if i seek help it will not work professional treatment is my last option, so i would like to refrain from choosing this option unless i begin to have panic attacks or my life becomes considerably unlivable i know this has developed into a sort of rant, but believe me when i tell you that i have never discussed the finer points of my depression and anxiety with anyone who actually accepted that i indeed had a problem finally, a summary: as an anxious individual, how can i replace my paranoid emotions with healthier ones? i have heard people say that you must train yourself to think happier thoughts how does one do this? shouting ""life is great"" in my head while i'm shaking from personal contact doesn't seem to help much joking aside i am seriously asking also, what kinds of low-impact exercise can i try to stimulate my brain a little more? and what kinds of foods are known to improve anxiety or depression? and lastly, what can i do to encourage myself to be more open and true to who i am? it feels as if my brain has constructed a thick wall of cement around myself so that i cannot even penetrate it tldr: i need advice on how to ""fix"" my anxiety, disregarding the obvious choice of professional help and medication",23,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cd4o8/terribly_anxious_seeking_advice_concerning/,1276091004

this out anonymously to someone i guess i am depressed (?), but i feel like i alternate wildly between being really angry (sometimes) and just defeated, deflated, and sad (often) i can actually feel a profound heaviness in my chest i snap easily at people, but then i also cry at the drop of a hat over the silliest things that i see or hear and i do ridiculous stuff like listening to cry-inducing songs on repeat hoping i'll reach catharsis sometimes i don't know how i hold it together i almost had a breakdown at a coffeeshop the other day when i must've looked so pitiful that the barista said ""you look sad is everything okay?"" i don't think i would ever commit suicide because i do believe that i can make things better for myself somehow (?!) but i still entertain the idea as a ""fantasy "" i like to think about how it would give people pause and i have to admit that i like thinking about how it would jar and hurt the few people in my life, even though i'm not really that close to anyone i thought over time that i would just become numb to the shittiness, but instead, i've become hyper-senstitive and unstable i almost feel kind of paranoid how fucked up is this: i like to imagine the ways that i can hurt people's feelings but then i feel so guilty and terrible and monstrous i don't believe i am a good person here's some background on me i know it will be kind of long, but i think it will help me to write it out (incidentally, one of the things i find frustrating--whether it's the thought of talking to a therapist or just making small talk in the hope of pursuing friends--is that it takes so long to get people ""caught up "") i grew up in what was basically a white trash family it wasn't physically abusive, but there was an alcoholic stepfather in the picture, the presence of religion, lots of redneck fighting between family members, and their general disgust that i turned out to be gay (i came out as i was graduating from hs in the 90s) i was always a black sheep for being nerdy and not conventionally masculine i lived for school and did well enough to attend a good college on a scholarship the future looked bright, but i was also very sheltered, with a really limited worldview i did very well in college--on paper--but never found a true passion i was just good at getting as in everything, and i focused on the competition rather than the actual learning i also struggled with having a different class background from my peers, feeling like i was always backward and culturally ""behind"" no matter what i did anger and resentment occasionally bubbled up, but despite this, i enjoyed a close-knit group of friends in college--a little coterie of about 6 people it seemed like we did everything together i guess i had mistakenly thought that the rest of life would be like college: that i'd always have a core group of friends, a default set of people who were like a family to me, considering that i no longer saw my own family i've lost that and worry i'll never find it again ever since i graduated from college, going on ten years now, things have slowly crumbled apart i had a good job for about two years before quitting, but then i really dicked around, unsure how to proceed there was a new plan every couple of months, and it seemed like i never finished anything i started this went on for about 7 years i began a grad program and quit i'd start a job and then leave after six months i'd decide i didn't like the city i was in, and then i'd pick up and move i think that every time i did this, i was looking for a fresh start, hoping that it would somehow magically be like college and that i'd quickly find a group of friends i had a lot of random sex (always protected though i had a lot of different partners) sometimes i'd make one good friend for a period, and we'd spend time together constantly in a weird intense platonic friendship way but it always ended when someone moved, or there was a falling out, or the friend got a boyfriend i never became part of any group to this day, i only have one friend in my city, and we only hang out together, alone, separate from his other friends who are big partiers i guess i was/am kind of like a serial monogamist but with friendships and this whole time, i never dated anyone longer than a couple of months after i have sex with a guy a couple of times, i find him uninteresting or just annoying and if i date someone and begin to care about him emotionally, i lose all sexual attraction to him i'm also feeling increasingly unattractive myself and am beginning to put on some weight, though i'm only at 5-10 185 right now when i used to be 5-10 165 i don't look awful yet, but my friend told me i was ""letting myself go "" what else well i was in terrible debt a few years back (from never keeping a steady job) and had to declare bankruptcy while that sucks, it did allow me to get a fresh start, and i am managing my money better i was able to start grad school with a smidge of renewed clarity and i think i have a direction for the future (though i've been slow to look for internships and part time work) i also ended up in a good roommate situation so there are upsides to my current situation but i've been in this city (a large one) for several years now, and it still sucks i feel so alone and helpless meanwhile, i see all these other people who are happy and active, whether it's straight married couple walking their kids or gaggles of gay guys out for a night on the town i don't seem to enjoy the things that others enjoy i don't like going to bars, and i don't like drinking i'm not sportive i can't stand theater or even movies it's summer, and i don't even like these stupid outdoor festivals that everyone is obsessed with i hate dinner parties and other pretentious shit that a lot of the gay guys i encounter are into (one of the sub-themes is that i really resent gay culture because of how superficial it feels ) i sometimes feel like i am defined by what i dislike rather than what i like meanwhile, all of my friends from college are living these absurdly charmed lives they're attorneys, consultants, professors, pharmacists, journalists, and so on and now they're mostly married and have popped out a kid or two they own condos and houses and seem so thrilled by it all they've made it look so easy and natural i am jealous on one hand, but i also don't want the same things they do it seems like they've stopped being interesting people a few more things: i'm tremendously impatient with people i judge quickly, even though i know i shouldn't i have a hard time finding other people who share my values i'm an atheist i also don't see the appeal of alcohol, and i never use drugs or smoke pot i'm not a ladder climber and don't really want to make a lot of money i just want to have a job that i enjoy that doesn't make the world any worse and that will pay me enough to live comfortably on (for me that would be $40-45k a year after i'm done with my master's) what really gives me the sinking feeling is when i see lonely old people lugging their stuff to the laundry mat or counting change for coffee at mcdonald's i worry that i will be like that, with no one to care about except a cat or two okay, well there's obviously more, but i don't want to take up everyone's entire day this was long enough as-is! thanks for letting me dump out all this shit i'll take any thoughts or suggestions [i suppose i could pursue counseling through my university, but one of the people who works in the counseling

cgnem,depression,anonbcofobvs,does having suicidal thoughts automatically mean that you're depressed?,"for a long time, i've had the occasional suicidal thought it usually happens when i'm sad or unhappy about something, and i don't see any solution for fix to the underlying problem -- i just have to accept it and move on, but in the meantime i'm sad and while i'm sad and feeling helpless, i will sometimes think about killing myself an example: i broke up with a girl when she moved away last year, and since then we've been talking on and off rationally, i don't see any way that we will get together again -- i want to, and she says that she could possibly see it happening one day, but at the moment she has a boyfriend and wants to see where things go with him meanwhile, i'm graduating in a year and need to start looking for jobs, but those jobs will likely not be near where she is living so all of this makes me sad yet, for whatever reason, i'm unable to move past the idea of being with her so i'm sad about it i'm sad when i hear about things that she's doing with her boyfriend, i'm sad when i talk to her and she says that she and her boyfriend are having problems but she's confused as to what to do and isn't breaking up with him and so at night when i'm falling asleep, i think about just killing myself stabbing, gunshot, etc running away into a remote part of the country and killing myself in a shallow grave so that it looks like i just disappeared and my parents don't know that i killed myself all sorts of things i know that i'd never go through with this sort of thing - i could never do it to my family it would destroy my mom and dad so, i *know* that i won't do it i just think about it is this normal? it's not a new thing (i just picked one example of something that triggers these thoughts now) i've had these types of thoughts for at least 10 years, in varying amounts depending on whether i'm sort of profoundly sad or not i was about to say that i function just fine on a day to day basis but then i realized that it's not true i didn't do any work today, didn't do any yesterday, and in fact only did about 4 hours of real work this entire week i still go to work, and sit at my desk, and socialize as normal but i don't really accomplish anything and i should -- i have plenty to do i'm just not doing it i saw a therapist last year, but it was for ""crisis counseling"" or something and at the time i was dealing with relationship issues with a girl, and getting over the girl before her maybe i am depressed? i've just always assumed that the occasional suicidal thought wasn't a big deal, because i knew i would never act on it it's just an idea that pops into my head, and then i think about the practical aspects of it and end up dismissing it but a friend said something about how their dad is having suicidal thoughts and so he's depressed, and i never thought that those two things were linked definitively like that are they? thanks for any thoughts that you have i'm going to go to bed, but i'll check this tomorrow at some point, so don't freak out if i don't reply to things :p",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cgnem/does_having_suicidal_thoughts_automatically_mean/,1276922495

cjxv7,depression,childhoodtrauma000,coping mechanisms from childhood trauma not working so well in young adulthood help?,"hey /r/depression, i'm gonna go out on a limb and request some serious advice a little back story my father died when i was five years old, at which point my mother became an alcoholic this progressed for a few years, getting worse and worse until she became pretty obviously suicidal i have lots of bad memories from this time of my life, such as: - my mom falling down the stairs (drunk), me hearing the noise and coming to see what it was, seeing her unconscious body at the bottom of the stairs with a lot of blood pouring out of her face i was home alone so i had to call the ambulance to take her away i think i was eight at the time - having to run home from school at lunch time to put my mother (who would be drunk) to bed, so that when the neighbour's kids came over (they ate lunch at our house) they wouldn't have to see her - her collapsing in the kitchen and cracking her head open on the table again, blood everywhere - her repeatedly telling me she wanted to die, to which i would reply ""when you say that, it makes me want to die too"" i was 10 at the time needless to say, i wasn't a very happy kid from ages 6 to about 11 one morning, i woke up late for school and went upstairs to see why my mom hadn't woke me up (she normally did at this point in my life) i found her unconscious in her bedroom, half on her bed and half on the floor, with an open pill bottle tipped over and pills all over the floor i tried to wake her but she didn't respond i called the ambulance and they carted her away, and luckily she didn't die after that, social services split my family into a few different temporary homes i lived with a neighbour for a few weeks, and my two brothers and two sisters went to live with friends my mom was sent to rehab, and she managed to get the treatment and help she needed she came home a few weeks later, and she hasn't relapsed into her alcoholism or suicidal tendencies since then i'm 22 now, and i'm doing a lot of introspection about my childhood specifically, i'm trying to identify all the behaviours i used back then to help cope with the emotional trauma i've noticed that every serious relationship i've ever had has disintegrated over time, because i tend to grow distant and drift away from the girl i'm dating part of me thinks that it's related to my childhood, given that isolation and escapism were the ways i learned to cope with bad things going on around me i recently had a 2-year relationship implode on me because i couldn't emotionally connect with her anymore i had become depressed and distant, and let the relationship die over the span of a few months i just stopped caring about anything now, i'm trying to pick up the pieces and move forward, hopefully never making the same mistake again so if you're still here, thanks for reading all that i guess my main question is, how do you unlearn the behaviours that originated as a result of childhood emotional trauma, when they are clearly not beneficial to my life anymore? i'm reading books on cognitive behaviour therapy at taking 20mg citalopram daily for depression, but i still barely feel like i have the capacity to be intimate with anyone anymore can anyone give me some advice? has anyone been through something similar?",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cjxv7/coping_mechanisms_from_childhood_trauma_not/,1277768376

cq3mm,depression,3525252,not really depression how to anxiety about death?,"edit: wow screwed up the title, how to handle anxiety about death? i guess this doesn't really fit here because i don't think i really am a depressed person yeah i can often feel sad but it's not like an every day thing normally it just seems like the anxiety subreddit is kind of dead, so i thought i would post here whenever i stop to consider death, i have some sort of anxiety attack i think about the permanence of death in particular and i start to be overcome with anxiety and start to hyperventilate this often happens when i am alone and it is quiet or dark, like before going to sleep the only way for me to overcome this at the time is to turn on the light and get up and go do something to distract myself until i fall asleep these attacks seem to come in waves, because once i start thinking about it, it is hard not to think about it on a nightly basis eventually, i can go a few weeks or so without thinking about it, but something will trigger it again like reading a dark book and i will be back in the routine for example, reading the road was not a good idea i can't bring myself to believe in anything like a heaven, anything beyond the basics of your brain goes dead and thoughts cease to fire i wish i did believe something like this sometimes because i'd imagine it would help to believe in something after death, but i just can't convince myself i guess i am looking for advice on how to handle this anxiety i have read a million little phrases about how to live in the moment, go day to day, this is your only life so just enjoy it, everybody dies so why worry?, etc how do other people deal with these thoughts? are these anxiety attacks a common thing for people? just curious",12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cq3mm/not_really_depression_how_to_anxiety_about_death/,1279238898

ct8nj,depression,somethingrandom101,i feel my life goals are unobtainable and therefore have 0 motivation to do anything,"i'm not sure how to write something like this, hopefully it'll make enough sense for someone to read it and help me out basically, it's what the title says i'm currently doing computer science @ uni, with the main aim of programming video games sadly though; it's incredibly hard to get anywhere near the industry and for the most part, i just feel it's incredibly unique (especially with the millions of other people who want to do something similar, majority of which who are probably better/smarter than i) and therefore i feel it's totally unobtainable to the point where i don't even try to get anywhere i've tried to get myself to do self-projects and demos which will help me when i graduate (hell, even bought a $1500 macbook which i'm still paying off because i thought i could make some iphone applications and take my career in that direction) but i have no motivation because of the fact that i'll never eventuate to anything like that and i just get the overwhelming feeling that i shouldn't even bother because it won't get me anywhere all i've done (in terms of programming) outside of uni work are basic tutorials that's not the only thing; i've been recently i've been interested in doing a bit of djing (as i've liked trance music forever) but considering there are probably thousands of people who are in the same position trying to get somewhere with it, i just find that, again, it's so unique the fact that there aren't exactly many good djs compared to the thousands who want to get there depresses me because i find it so unobtainable to the extent where i don't even want to practice i've considered sharing what i have recorded to people but i'm just too ashamed to share it considering my skill level and the skill level of many others, it seems to be a bit of a realitycheck that i'll never be that good (i haven't even told that many people because i'm that ashamed) it just saddens me because i feel like i'm wasting my time and that i should be doing something else and trying to get somewhere like my friends/family so, basically, i just feel like shit all the time now i do things that need to be done, but when i get some time to myself or anything of the sort, i find myself being incredibly bored and don't even bother trying to better myself in anything because the skill required in either programming or djing is so high to be picked over the thousands of people wanting to be there i'm 20, and not sure what i want to do in life, and the fact that i'm 2/3 done in a degree scares me because i'm not sure if i want to be a programmer i really, really don't want to find out that computer science/programming isn't my thing and i don't want to waste peoples time/money in making this realisation; but i seriously get bummed out at the thought of this kind of thing it's like how everyone says that everyone is always good at that one thing; i just don't know what my 'thing' is, and i'm really bummed out about that because i'm starting to think it's a bit of a lie people say you're meant to work for the things you love and that it shouldn't feel like work but i can't find any real motivation to do anything because i just feel i'll never get there i can seriously see myself, after graduation, just sitting around home doing nothing i want to change this, but i just can't get over this whole attitude i'm hoping someone can shed some light for me, as i'm not really sure how to progress from here luckily uni starts again on monday so i'll be able to focus on that and not have to think about this kind of thing for the next few months *edit: thanks guys; for some reason i can only see 3 (out of 5) comments, but i'm amazed at the number of upvotes and comments, i seriously didn't think that many people would be interested in helping me out i'm focusing on my studies at the moment and just trying to change my attitude as well as reading histories of the top people in programming/djing and trying to drum into my head the fact that everyone started from nothing thanks again :)*",7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ct8nj/i_feel_my_life_goals_are_unobtainable_and/,1279983945

cu0yb,depression,ilessthanthreemath,a warning about using lamictal/lamotrigine,"just wanted to throw this out there, writing this based off of personal experience as those who take it may well know, lamictal (generic lamotrigine) carries a black box warning about stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe, possibly fatal skin rashes) obviously, one should consult their doctor immediately when symptoms start to appear one less severe (and less spoken of) side effect, however, is short-term memory loss most people seem to learn to deal with it in my case, however, it's only gotten worse as the months have gone by in the first few months, i would have minor problems remembering minor things like the location of my keys or wallet later, i started to develop concentration problems where my mind would wander and i couldn't focus properly i would also occasionally go to bed and wake up to see that i had sent out emails or gone on a farming run in guild wars since i always have my smartphone with me, i tried to ""deal with it"" like my doctor suggested and tried writing down everything important (since lamictal works fairly well for treating my problems and there's nothing else really like it) now, recently, it's gotten to the point where my short-term and long-term memory have both pretty much been fried i experience massive gaps in my day in addition to the sporadic forgetfulness i was at home the other day and couldn't remember anything that had happened that morning not waking up, not driving to campus for summer classes, not taking notes (which i obviously had, there was insane, almost illegible scribbling in my notebook), not the drive back i also can't recall certain things from the past year, things that i shouldn't forget names of people, places, things i've done i *know* that i took a course during the first summer semester a few weeks ago but i can't recall anything about that entire month and a half i don't know what i did in the course (i passed it, but the notes are entirely nonsensical) i don't know what i did in my free time while out of class it's a complete blank i have a new set of semi-expensive headphones but have no recollection of *when* i bought them without looking at the invoice (about three months ago) trying to think hard about things that happened a while ago usually ends up with a minor headache and no concrete answers **tl;dr: if you have memory problems with lamictal, don't screw around, don't try to ""deal with it"" like i tried to do talk to your doctor and jump ship before you can't manage it anymore ** i'm not saying that lamictal is a bad drug - without it, i don't know what kind of shape i would be in today either more miserable with my memory intact, or dead in a gutter, i don't know right now, i'm at a loss as to what to do stepping down the dosage didn't make it less noticible before (and i can't go off it), so my doctor is making me try a third option: supplementing the current cocktail of stuff with something to try to boost focus and concentration i don't have high hopes that this is going to work at all",14,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cu0yb/a_warning_about_using_lamictallamotrigine/,1280192571

cwozq,depression,viciouscycles,is this depression? or is it just me unable to cope?,"throw away account here i'm a 26 year old female i feel like my life is a roller coaster i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when i was 12 i would say it was a year or so later when i started to feel really depressed after moving out of state when i was 9, i didn't make any good friends until i was in high school, so i was pretty lonely most of the time i was diagnosed with poly-cystic ovarian syndrome when i was in the hospital with a kidney infection when i was 18 this past january i was told i have an under active thyroid and put on levothyroxin back in april i was told i had very low vitamin d levels and have been taking supplements since i have also battled with being over weight most of my life i finally got a therapist around 14 or 15 years old i knew i was depressed and had suicidal thoughts i put a knife to my wrist a couple times, but never did much damage i had tried to tell my mom that i was depressed and needed help but she just said ""it's normal for teenagers to feel this way because of hormones "" she finally agreed to let me see a therapist when i told her i had ""tried"" to kill myself x_x i went to therapy, was taking zoloft &amp; welbutrin, and began to improve my psychiatrist tried to put me on topamax at one point as well, but i had a bad reaction to it eventually i came off welbutrin and then zoloft too i felt better fast forward a couple years, i felt the depression coming back i went back to the same therapist, but it wasn't working i felt worse going there than i did without it so i stopped going and somehow i managed to pull myself through it and i started to feel better again fast forward to 2006 and that's when i moved out of my parent's i was ecstatic to be out (i have a much better relationship with them now compared to when i lived with them), but i did have a some really awful experiences with the first 2 roommates that caused me a lot of anxiety and financial stress my friends either moved away or were off at college i started to feel lonely and depressed; but this bout was different i was experiencing drastic mood swings one day i was very depressed, and another i was full of energy and really happy i ended up seeing the same therapist again and a new psychiatrist the therapist didn't help me much (she kept trying to pressure me to join her yoga class, which i have no interest in) the psychiatrist thought i had bipolar disorder though and i was put on prozac and lamictal eventually i felt better and things were looking good i even met my boyfriend in march 2007 eventually i stopped taking the meds (mostly to cut back on expenses, cus i was barely making it) my financial state has always caused me a lot of anxiety, especially when the medical expenses just pile up fast forward to summer 2009 huge change at my job a lot of lay offs of course, but my old position (which i was perfectly content with and enjoyed) disappeared and i was put in a new position that caused me great anxiety i felt inexperienced (there was only one competent person, and the entire office needed him to help) and i was more in the ""spot light"" than i was in the previous position i started having nightmares and a lot of anxiety eventually it got so bad that i just stayed home from work for a week because i couldn't motivate myself to go in well, skipping the details, i ended up quitting i saw my primary doctor and got a rx for prozac for the anxiety i managed to find a new job at the end of august i finished the one month supply of prozac and felt like i didn't need it anymore my new job started out great, but eventually the same thing happened; huge changes and stress the turn over rate was pretty high and the one manager that was great ended up quitting the new manager was incompetent and had a pretty awful management style (ugh micromanaging) this was around the same time i was dealing with extreme exhaustion and told i had low vitamin d the stress and anxiety built up, i end up in the e r one day, and i feel like i can't deal with the job i asked if i could work part time or from home (they did not have issues with my performance and loved me there), but hr said no so i gave them my two week's notice and i quit i have been unemployed since june 5th and i've applied to so many jobs i am qualified for, but have not even gotten an interview my depression is getting worse and i feel like i just keep entering these cycles i can go for a year or more and feel fine for the most part, but then i still get this cycle of awful depression eventually i think i get a handle on things, but then i fall apart again eventually i know i need to go back to therapy, but i have no income now so i can't afford it i'm scared about going back on meds because i'm afraid long term use will cause me to gain weight and it's so hard as it is for me not to gain weight due to my other medical problems i am scared of losing everything, including what i value the most, my independence the last thing i want is to have to ask my parents for money and/or to move back to their house i am crying every day because of how miserable i feel my boyfriend tells me i'll feel better once i get a job, but i don't know if that's true and who is to say that job won't be stressful? i may just fall apart again my father has always told me i am too sensitive and i need to ""get a thicker skin"" my sister told me i ""can't handle life"" i've never had any ambitions or goals or a lot of interests i went to college but just got an associates in liberal arts because i never found anything i wanted to major in or make into a career i am so depressed, lonely, and tired when i am not job hunting, i am in bed trying to sleep so i don't have to be conscious to deal with my sadness and anxiety i know it will pass eventually, it always went away before but then i also know it always comes back so will i ever actually beat this? or am i really stuck with these cycles for life? i know there are people out there who go through way worse things in life and can deal with them and be happy, but it doesn't seem to be that way for me so then i feel awful because i can't cope and i know my family looks down on me for it it hurt so much when my sister told me i can't handle life i always looked up to her growing up, and when she said that, it was like a big slap in the face and made me realize how she really views me she doesn't believe in depression at all and thinks i use it just as an excuse and that i am a ""spoiled brat"" i really wish i had more friends irl i have plenty online or people i know irl that live out of state, but my ""local"" friends are few and they never call me or ask me to hang out (yet they'll talk to me online no problem) and if i initiate plans with them, they'll suddenly bail or not show up without even telling me it feels pointless to try to hang out with them if they're that flaky i have my boyfriend right now, but then i feel like i am ""depending"" on him to make me happy and that scares me because i know that's not right i should be able to happy on my own and i don't want to depend on him to feel some sort of happiness but on top of it all, i've been having bad dreams (daydreams too) about losing him, usually him dying or leaving me i'm really hitting rock bottom here and i don't know what to do because i have no income and can't afford the therapy or meds i probably need i'm also angry as hell that i may need to rely on the meds to function like a ""normal"" person sorry if i jumped around a lot i'm just typing my feelings/thoughts as they come :/",12,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cwozq/is_this_depression_or_is_it_just_me_unable_to_cope/,1280809466

i think most people, myself included, did it / do it because they hope to be a provider for their family i'm 36 &amp; it's obvious that i'll never have kids at this point that breaks my heart &amp; really makes me angry so, that's some of my back story my dream - honestly, the only dream i seem to have these days - is to pack up &amp; live the life of a van dweller google it if you don't know what i'm talking about pack up, hit the road with my camera &amp; just live say the hell with life as i've been trained to live it sacrifice, struggle, figure out where i'm going from day to day &amp; just fucking live no rat race no bullshit just life be a nomad thing is, though - i'm not sure if this is a realistic thought i mean, i dream about this! i actually have dreams about what my life would be like on the road i've always enjoyed road trips / wanderlust i think i'd be happy however, 36 years of life has taught me that you're supposed to have a steady job &amp; income you're supposed to have all of these things that we all have if you don't you're abnormal furthermore, i don't know if this is just my depression talking if i weren't depressed, would i still feel the same?

d6k5t,depression,paintpaint,all i want is a hug from someone who really cares about me,"hello, reddit i am an 18 year old guy i am in my last year of school now, and i know i should be working really hard to get a good degree i find it extremely hard to focus on important but unenjoyable things such as homework or school, i can hardly stay alert to a topic that doesn't interest me for an hour which is why my grades in school aren't the best ones in classes that i'm not interested in, like, for example mathematics on the other hand, i do score really good grades in classes i am interested in, like philosophy and politics but whenever i decide do do my homework, i drift away and start thinking about other stuff i know this sounds rather common, but i'm not exaggerating when i say that i just can't work on things i don't like i really can't but i need to so today, my parents wrote me a very serious letter telling me to work harder because these months will decide over my future which is true this made me think about myself too if you meet me first, you will probably think of me of a happy, friendly, active, and intelligent person i do lots of different activities, including ""cool"" extreme sports and so on i like to think that i know what to wear, i am not particularly ugly and i don't stand out in a negative way i find it easy to talk to people and to make new contacts and i think that i'm not stupid but inside, i feel really bad and hopeless when people spend more time with me, they realize that all those ""cool"" things, the ""underground"" music i listen to, the sports i do, the cloths i wear are only coverups for my real self they are like accessories since i spend so much time with maintaining my cool self, i feel like my real self is slowly dying and the artificial me is becoming myself because of that, although i do have social contacts, i party, do sports, etc, nobody really wants to be my friend i realized yesterday that i don't have any true friends the people i spend my time with spend time with the artificial me they don't know me and if they did, they wouldn't spend time with me i am very afraid of my future all i want is someone who knows me, nobody does right now, a hug from someone who really cares about what i think and am, it's really all that i need but i can't just take off my mask i had suicidal thoughts in the last few hours but i know that i couldn't do that, especially because of my parents but if it weren't for them, there would be no reason for me not to do it i just wanted to write this down, this has already helped me, so i might as well post it tl;dr: average depressed teenager **edit** : thanks for your replies, i feel a lot better already, read through some other questions on here and realized that this is quite normal in my age life's ahead of me, if i worry too much i won't change a thing, i'll just have to keep going through this and it'll be alright i'll start being more honest and true to people, that will help me find out who really likes *me* i have the feeling like my relationship with my parents is getting worse though, them writing a letter to me instead of talking to me hurt me i also thought about ways to make new contacts since this would be easier than to change the relationship i already have with my friends",14,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d6k5t/all_i_want_is_a_hug_from_someone_who_really_cares/,1283004793

private school kids are weird anyway and i was weird even for them not cute socially inept like screech or whatever, like i wouldn't be surprised if people thought “why is that autistic boy attending a normal school?” makin weird noises to be funny and stuff my first semester of sophomore year i had no friends, the second one, i had one, who had transferred from the private school i went to freshman year i wasn't even bullied, just sorta ignored that entire year i sorta drifted through school life, talking to no one, at lunch i'd eat in the back of the library trying to avoid the library people because they didn't want people eating in there, i'd grab a random book off the shelves and just read imagine doing that once, then for a week/month/semester/entire school year i'd go home at night, do my homework, and surf forums/chans cause that's where i knew people all this while other people were hanging out with friends/having sex/ making mistakes and learning life lessons my only solace was when maybe every other month my middle school friends all going to the same private school would be all like “hey, we're doin something, wanna come along?” it's not like i was never given a chance, a couple times girls in class would ask “why do you never talk?” sympathetically, but i had literally no idea how to respond other than mumbling “i've got nothing to say” or something i had spent my entire adolescence online/playing video games/reading comics and had nothing outside of those things i knew how to talk talk about junior and senior years weren't that bad, eventually i found a couple other internet dorks and i ended up discovering media tech/film, and finished off high school with some friends i had never gotten drunk/smoked weed until last year i look back at my high school and feel like i wasted years of my life, and that compared to other people my age i'm immature because of my inexperience ever since maybe junior year i'd been helping out with a local film production company (everyone there 5-10 years my senior) and the summer before college i fell hard for a girl who crewed on one of their features after bumbling my way through the summer awkwardly asking basically everyone for advice to the point that it became a joke i ended up asking her to “hang out” and we hung out maybe twice before she went off to college we are presently located back in the same town and i still occasionally facebook-stalk to see how she's been, and when she's on chat consider saying something but chicken out my first semester of college i went to another town but ended up hating it/missing my city/flunking out/only making friends with the people in my dorm and even in the honors dorm with the other social retards i was the “weird one” the next semester i came back home and i'm now going to community i've made no friends at community college (suprise!!!) and most of my high school friends are gone for college today i spend most of my time lurking the internet and reading webcomics, i'd like to go out and socialize but none of my few friends are into that sort of thing, and if i don't already know anyone somewhere i won't talk i want desperately to break out from where i am and i only realized this (sad as it may be) from the internet i learned how other people are living their lives, dating and socializing and partying, about music and culture and how to not act like a huge spergy nerd i've never been formally diagnosed with asperger's syndrome and i don't want to self-diagnose like a tool, but i've been helped massively by a lot of the resources out there for aspies and even things as simple as etiquette guides i feel like over the past year i've grown massively w/r/t healthy ideas about social interaction/women/other humans/myself i can actually do alright now talking to people about something other than mario!

d76us,depression,carryoncamping,terrible experience last night,"last night i went to bed very early as i felt incredibly depressed, i couldn't eat dinner and struggled to find the strength to even talk to my parents in bed i thought for a number of hours about the stress related anxiety that i had been diagnosed with around christmas and thought how most likely i had also been depressed for a long period of time as well i came to the conclusion that it was either the depression causing the anxiety due to the fact that i have been continually putting on a front (to myself and others) that everything is ok or it may have been the frustrating and restrictive nature of the anxiety has led to depression i felt relieved in a way, that i had recognised this and gotten some emotional release, i didnt feel anxious, as i was happy that i could begin to address the depression and move on and that this thin veneer of happiness that i had tried to maintain had fallen away i lay thinking for a while longer until suddenly i was hit by a terrible panic attack which led to me feeling incredibly detached and panicked for 2-3 mins (very dark uncontrollable thoughts) followed by the physical symptoms (which lasted through till the early hours) after having this attack i have come to realise that i have had a couple of much more minor attacks in the past couple of weeks this has left me feeling helpless today as i went from feeling good in a way that i was beginning to try and move on from this; to feeling helpless and terrible within a couple of hours i feel incredibly low today and feel as though i cant go on (not suicidal, just exhausted in away from having to deal with this for so long) i also feel physically sick and am having trouble eating i have an exam tomorrow and have to submit a 10,000 word dissertation by the end of the month both of these things are looking incredibly challenging to me **edit:** i am 20 and in the uk; i have not been drinking in order to control the problem i have had trouble sleeping in the sense that i go to bed at 1-2 am and don't get out of bed till around midday perhaps adjusting my sleeping pattern may help? i went to the doctor at christmas and was referred to a councillor who told me to do breathing exercises and listen to stress relief tapes in order to try to reduce the anxiety feeling as i did then it was pretty tough to take this on and to try and implement it into my daily routine however, i eventually got to a stage whereby i felt that i could control the anxiety (it did not go away completely) at this point the breathing exercises/tape listening phased out i am feeling pretty overwhelmed today and i am really just completly fed up of feeling anxious and trying to put on this false pretence to myself and others that i am ok when really i feel pretty awful",6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d76us/terrible_experience_last_night/,1283170327

none of them know each other, so i just float between everyone else's groups of friends feeling like a i don't belong with any of them when i call or text people i just get ignored, and no one ever calls or texts me to see what i'm doing or if i'd like to join them anywhere three people came to my birthday this year, which was three more than last year, i guess i haven't had a girlfriend in years and feel like i can't even talk to women without making an ass of myself, and on the few occasions i've gotten a woman to come home with recently i haven't been able to preform in the bedroom, i just feel dead down there unless i'm masturbating sometimes i want to just pack the basics and skip town and start new somewhere, but then i think that isolating myself even more can't be healthy, and on top of that i don't have the money necessary for such a move although it seems all i do these days is isolate myself in my house it was a beautiful day outside today, but i just couldn't get motivated to go outside i just sat in bed and played video games on my phone and surfed the web i used to love to cook, but now i just eat out because i'm lazy when i ate that is i've lost my appetite my stomach is grumbling as i type this, but i just don't feel like eating my sleep schedule is destroyed sometimes i don't go to sleep until 5am i often wake up around 10-12 regardless of when i went to bed the night before my memory is fucked i can't remember things seconds after i hear them sometimes or plots of tv shows or movies or food that i ate the next day it's awful, i feel like an idiot and i now have crippling social anxiety i feel like nothing i have to say is worth saying because i live such an uninteresting life, what could i possibly have to add to any conversation and lastly i've been self-medicating i never used to drink or smoke too much, i was really good at being responsible with alcohol and marijuana, but i've been smoking a lot of pot recently, even though i know it bums me out, i just hope that it'll make the show i'm watching funnier or the food i'm eating taste better then on the few nights i do go out with friends i drink too much because i feel like it's the only way i'm capable of interacting with people i want to fix this but i don't know what to do i know i should be exercising i'm not overweight but i have no muscle tone or stamina of course i can't get motivated enough to start an exercise routine it seems like everything i want to do costs money i don't have, and i can't seem to find a job that will actually pay me i'd love to join a gym, or see a therapist or get medication but i can't afford it and it drives me fucking nuts i feel like i'm stuck in this pit and i can't get out tl;dr: how can i treat my depression when i have no money and no motivation?",12,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dae68/broke_lonely_and_unmotivated_how_can_i_get_out_of/,1283820274

(and yes, i'm aware that my analogy could use some work ) yet, that's exactly what i do in depression the second you start feeling down and out - and this is still a revolutionary idea for me - *do something about it!* play a game, walk a dog, annoy a cat, order dessert, run some laps, go swimming, plant something, help someone else, take a smoke break, make a sandwich, look at lolcats - anything! so often, if i feel down, my first reaction is to kick myself for it - i'll 'forget' to take medications, sleep through things and blame myself for it, avoid work and dwell on it don't do these things its a slippery slope once you take a step down, you'll just pick up momentum when you feel down, think about what's making you sad - and if, like me, they're irrelevant, self-created, trivial problems - tell them to fuck themselves take a break indulge do something that makes you happy - and this is important - **as soon as you can ** every second you spend depressed is another second you could spend being well, happy! next time you feel down, just do one simple thing - **fight back ** you're worth it - remember that",8,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dimey/depression_is_an_illness/,1285387100

""where is happiness?"" i still believe in a sort of god, but these days whatever it is should be so abstract the word god becomes meaningless to apply towards whatever it is to this day i have received no answer i sniffled, i picked myself up, and put one foot ahead of the other i feel often times, i have made too many mistakes too many mistakes that i just don't know how to fix and there is not enough time i could literally list them all, all the events in my life that lead up to me being 24 years old and being completely burnt out; best friend dying, failing out of high school, losing every single friend (completely honest, if you could even call them friends), a pitiful family that is only tied by blood it really only scratches the surface albeit, i have managed a few successes; receiving my ged certification, starting college—both of which were in this very same year—maintaining a dreadful boring job, mostly because i have to when i passed my ged and i stated i was going to college, nobody in the immediate household cared i got a pat on a back and a reminder the rent is due big help family has ever been rent is about 70% of the money i make from my (dead end) job i can only afford one class this semester, and probably only 2-3 classes if possible, even if i were to get student loans also i just feel dumb again, once i am back in school like i just don't belong even for just one class, and its an english class! something i was at least decent at in high school i've just been horribly depressed, lonely, for so long it's beginning to seem like a fact of nature: ""people are islands unto themselves "" just like the sun rises and earth rotates i've had maybe two relationships in my life and both of those failed, due to distance, due to other things i don't even know if i am capable of reciprocating real love anymore i can say the words, even put 'emotion' behind them i mean, honestly, i don't even care if my father or mother or brothers passed away right now then again, i don't think they'd care too much either if i hit the bucket i don't think i see human beings as human beings anymore going back, i'm not doing too well in college, even if its only one class i can't seem to focus, and understand even the logistics of grammar, or at least when it comes to presenting proper exercises if i am having problems in a subject i use to be considered good in, what is going to happen when i get to math? if i can even afford to keep up going to college i think maybe its because i am pulling full time hours at my dead end grocery store job, and it could possibly be, but then how else am i going to pay the rent that my family forces upon me? i just don't know what to do anymore i hate this place my family moved to, i hate the people where we came from i don't feel at home within' my own family i don't have any friends since they ditched me even before moving here, and i haven't made any real lasting relationships since living here two years i don't have the money to go out, eat out if i could move i would, but i have nowhere to go nor the money to support myself, even if it was a shared apartment found off of craigslist to a lesser degree, i don't know what i want anymore what i want to be, what i want to do who i should even be? i thought i was on the right track getting my ged, getting my ass in college even if my own family doesn't give a damn every step i take seems like another two steps back i can't even live a life due to monetary constraints or have hobbies i'm pretty much at the quarter part of my life, the pinnacle position where the opportunities of life should be presenting themselves, but all i see is closed doors i tried to start up a hobby with photography i lurked the subreddit for roughly a year, and saved up all my money and bought a dslr i probably only gone out on shootouts twice i don't feel inspired by anything when i look up on flickr for inspiration of what photographs people take around my area, its all the same, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, ocean, maybe a few model photographs; florida doesn't inspire in the past couple weeks, all i can manage is thinking about dying, or of trying to scrounge up so money to buy a motorcycle—to drive off and never be heard from again i don't like it here—in florida—or anywhere i don't have a home i only have two friends, who are 2 hours away, and 2000 miles away respectively i hate my job so much anger at my family for never helping and always taking i am tired of being lonely, yet loneliness is all i know i don't even feel like a human being anymore in so many ways, i am still that young little boy crying out to father be it god or something entirely else, demanding answers demanding reason for this bullshit of a reality except that is a lie i don't care anymore, i just want to be gone—off on a motorcycle—retired in alaska far from civilization—dead i just don't understand anything anymore and it's been that way for a long time",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dks7v/i_just_dont_know/,1285809845

i did not feel as though my current ‘plane’ of consciousness typed that it was as though something in me, below this plane, told me to i’m not sure i’m not making this up maybe i’m trying to appear interesting i worry that i may only be pretending to think that i’m pretending i convince myself that that is how it is and then it is so something of my own creation i’m not sure if i mean that do i mean that something in me just said something: “get out” i think that one was me making it up to fill space but there was something but my mind is preventing me from recalling the phrase i worry i make up that voice the one on the lower plane, the other me (i may or may not mean the dame other me as before) could just be me making it up or it could be a cry for help i don’t know now something in me wants me to type ”help” in all caps i;m not sure wheather it’s a genuine call for help or part of me trying to fake it to debase the actual times that voice speaks up so i’ll no longer listen to it because i’ll assume it’s a hoax concocted by myself for some reason i can’t explain this is why i question myself this is why i say i don’t know my own motivations i don’t know who i am i don’t i need help but i have no way of explaining this to someone maybe what i’ve typed will help maybe part of me tells me to write those one word sentences in for style this is one of those things that makes me thing that the way i portray many of my own problems is insincere as a result of the same thing that made me type those one word sentences i hear a woman’s voice screaming, “help me” in my head it was only there for a few moments i only heard it a few times i woke ~8am for work today ~9 i had a 3shot espresso ~12 i had a medium mocha (3shots) on my way to my psych discussion i ate a chicken croissant had a sip of a mt dew in my dorm i had a largish dinner spinach with french (plate) french fries, sesae rice and 2 corndogs milk and apple juice to drink mocha at espresso expose afterwards , must have been 7:30 finished that not sure when mt dew afterwards drank a peace tea 2-4:30 i would think not sure i’m at the present i’m going to set an alarm and try to write the paper when i get up this was typed from 4-5am i believe it is currently 5:05 and i remember starting shortly before or after 4 though i could be mistaken but i believe that is a semi reliable recollection i really need help",5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dlewt/i_wrote_this_late_at_night_i_wasnt_stable_nor_am/,1285923156

dmgmd,depression,[deleted],went on a weekend trip to visit a girl ended in disappointment,"i feel like i just need someone to talk to or someone to listen i guess i've been struggling with some mild depression for a few years now sometimes better, sometimes worse i find that it depends heavily on what's going on in my life when things start going badly or i get stressed out, i feel like everything just builds up and i go downhill this past week was bad for me i'm a senior in college and i'm starting to freak out about graduation and finding a job (even though it's not until april) first off, last week was our career fair at our school (where companies come to recruit for 2 days) and it was really stressful thinking that i had to find a career from this also, none of the companies i submitted my resume to have gotten back to me second, my grandfather died my mom didn't have a great relationship with him (especially in the past few years) and so i wasn't very close to him but it's still weird he's really the first person close to me that i've lost, and i'm not sure how to react it i haven't really yet third, and most influential, i went to visit a girl i had a romantic interest in over this past weekend we met over the summer and there was instant attraction i really like her she's cute and fun and outgoing and just generally awesome to be around we go to different schools, and i made plans a few weeks ago to visit her i was literally counting down the days until thursday when i went to see her and it was a complete let down instead of a joyous, fun reunion from the summer, i kind of felt like a second thought to her i spent a lot of time alone in her apartment while she went to do things (such as preparing for a concert she planned, doing homework / going to class, and work) even when we went out to parties, she seemed to ignore me she'd introduce me to someone and then go and talk to them, leaving me standing alone just not what i expected the last straw was today i worked hard to plan my flights so that i'd leave late in the day, giving us a full sunday together except she scheduled a work shift and ""couldn't switch it"" (although it didn't seem like she tried very hard) so as i mentioned above, i was left sitting in her apartment alone today, killing time until i had to call a cab to get to the airport so basically, something that was supposed to be a fun getaway turned into something completely depressing i didn't know what to expect from this summer fling, especially because it was long distance, but it's just a shock that the weekend turned out like this why would she have encouraged me to visit if she didn't really want to see me? so right now my confidence is shot i feel like i have nothing to look forward to my classes are just getting more and more intense and i'll soon have to lock myself in the library most days after class the weather is getting cold and the days shorter this one girl i had an interest in, that i looked forward to talking to each night, is seemingly out of the picture i've had this type of feeling before, but i'm not sure what to do to help it usually i just try to grind through it i just feel lethargic and unmotivated like nothing would be worth my time any words of encouragement?",12,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dmgmd/went_on_a_weekend_trip_to_visit_a_girl_ended_in/,1286166619

dnknr,depression,[deleted],"i am experienced with depression i know advice doesn't always help depressed people, but here's some anyway","i just learned about r/depression i'm so glad it's here i have had experience with depression since i was 12 or 13, and i'm 36 now i have had a long history with the black eyed dog i want to share with you some of my experiences and some things i've learned along the way i have suffered a lot over the years from this illness i missed a lot of valuable adolescent experiences and growth opportunities at the time i saw several reasons that this happened: they weren't worth my time, or i didn't have the energy, or they were associated with people i hated i wasn't until much later that i put the pieces together and realized that all this negativity had a root i'm still learning how to deal with it i don't consider myself an expert by any means, but i look around here and i see a lot of people who are really struggling i figured some of this stuff could be helpful to someone, so here goes * many of the things you need to do in order to deal with depression involve things that depression makes especially difficult that's why it's such a bitch of a condition understand that if you intend to undertake a path to health, you will need to do a lot of things you really don't want to do, and exert energies you feel like you don't have it will suck temporarily face up to the suck know the suck is coming * get into counseling now don't wait you're missing out on some things if you don't start facing up to your depression with seriousness you may not realize how badly it has affected you - accurate self-assessment is hindered by depression * not every counseling experience is equal cognitive therapy is very popular at the moment, which is a kind of therapy that tries to point out to you that some of the things you're thinking don't line up with reality and that's good, it's important to see that people respond to reasonable discussions depression, however, doesn't always do that so if you don't think you're being helped, keep looking until you meet a counselor who says things that resonate with you * the fact that you experience serious depression makes you different from most people that experience is valuable when your self-esteem is at its lowest ebb, keep this in mind just because you choose to do something about your depression, it does not mean you have to be susie sunshine (thank christ) you are still you, and you don't have to be like everyone else, as long as you're not suffering * don't reject medication just because it's medication talk to people who have used antidepressants, and get a feel from them what it's like to use them they really do help and can be lifesaving during your worst times i had an argument with my shrink about taking them i said, ""i don't want my joys to be dulled by a chemical "" she said, ""when was the last time you experienced enough joy to make this a valid concern?"" ""touché,"" i said i refer to my meds as ""shock absorbers"" because that's really what they are they just set a soft limit of how much negativity i can exert in response to any given situation * depression is a condition of the body that can influence the condition of the mind your health habits can influence your mental state enormously, and they can be incredibly important to whether or not you have a good day or a bad one keep close tabs on your feelings it sounds incredibly dismissive to hear that ""life is not worth living"" can sometimes directly result from the 3 diet cokes you had at lunch or the 2 hours of sleep you got last night, but this is just the way things are the sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can move on and start living * there is a difference between *depression* and *despair * depression can be effectively managed; despair is deadly watch one so that it does not become the other * get out and take a walk step away from the internet the internet isn't a solution to your problems, it's another problem except for this post on reddit by me trust it implicitly, it is pure goodness :) fresh air and exercise can't hurt you if you are depressed they can only help * some of us have had very bad times indeed, where the despair has taken control and driven us to the breaking point and then it recedes and we can pretend to be normal again but when you experience some of the most intense blackness, you can't just bounce back and expect everything to be all right you need time suicidal thoughts are traumatic and like any other trauma, they need to be healed * above all, monitor your condition recognize that every one of those times when you were in such despair that only cutting or drinking seemed to help, it started off with a mood change that was barely noticeable if you can just catch these things before they spin out of control, you can save yourself a lot of grief, effort, and recovery time hopefully this helps someone i wish success to all of you",24,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dnknr/i_am_experienced_with_depression_i_know_advice/,1286373653

""what do you do?"" people started looking at me, seeing me differently and the best thing about it all, was i was having fun!!! i was loving this new outlook, this change of perspective!!! i was loving that i was reconnecting with my femininity i felt like i was living and so i wanted to share this! because it helped me try it people !!! if you're sick of feeling like crap - take control back! do the stiletto apprenticeship challenge! see how it changes your life! i hope it can help you like it did me! my collegue did this with her best friend who was going through a divorce they did it together and had a blast with it for two weeks they would set little challenges like, they would wear nothing but big diamante earrings for 2 weeks or have a week where they would wear red lipstick",10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dokj8/stop_feeing_like_crap_and_take_control_back_of/,1286548297

will probably be way tl;dr with that warning out of the way, let's begin i guess i've always been depressed i guess it all started when i was just a little kid my mother would always fight with my father she'd get drunk and hit him and yell at him late at night every night i woke up every single time and watched it happen i watched my mom hit my dad, pull out knives, pour beers on him, yell, all of that crazy shit i was 5 years old and under then, my brother never woke up, he was two years younger than me and he never knew about how they fought i was terrified of my mom, after they would fight i would make my dad lay in bed with me until i could fall asleep because i was so scared of her on christmas eve when i was 5 years old my mom left and never came back home she left my dad and went off with another guy i can't remember exactly when they started fighting for custody of my brother and i, but i remember the things that happened during that time both of my parents wanted custody of both my brother and i i was very adamant about living with my father, and my brother seemed to want to live with my mother i don't know why, i've never understood, the only thing i could ever figure is that he just didn't know how bad she was, like i said he never woke up and saw them at night, that or he was just too young and he really didn't remember them together, i really don't know i remember being at my mothers apartment, it was just her and i there, she kept asking me if my father did drugs, i kept telling her no, every time i told her no, she sent me up to my brothers room and made me sit there until the next time she called me out and asked me the same question, this repeated all day until 7:00 came and it was time for my dad to pick me up she recorded all of my telephone calls, i know i was young and had very few rights to privacy, but what she did with the phone calls is what i have a problem with i was in about 7th grade and my boyfriend and i had just kissed/made out for the very first time the previous night, when i went to my moms house, my boyfriend and i talked on the phone and very shyly discussed the previous night my mom interpreted our conversation about kissing, into a conversation about having sex, she brought the tape to my fathers house the next day and played it, to my horror, in front of my father and i i tried to explain, she wouldn't listen, she made me take a pregnancy test one day after it happened at the time, i didn't know that a pregnancy test wouldn't show anything the next day, but now i do she would do things like this all of the time just to fuck with me and be hateful she's told me that she has cancer to get me to forgive her for all of the stupid shit she's done to me knowing that it was a lie literally fifteen minutes after i found out my grandfather died, my mother told me how selfish it is to be sad when people die my point here is, my mom has always been evil to me i'm a female and i've had an extraordinarily hard time getting through life with no woman influence as a teenager this was especially difficult fast forward a bit here to my senior year of high school about ten days after my senior year started, my grandfather passed away my father and i moved into my grandfathers house when i was in the fifth grade because he fell and broke a hip and needed someone to take care of him ever since he broke his hip, it was just one thing after another, his health was very bad and it wasn't uncommon for him to be in the hospital for weeks at a time many times a year he was diabetic, had to get a feeding tube, couldn't walk very well, required a nurse to come daily, etc before he died, he was in the hospital for several weeks i didn't visit him often during that time for lots of reasons, i was really busy, band camp 9 hours a day for two weeks, senior year starting, i was a stupid fucking selfish kid shit that i look back and know how unimportant it was i was a stupid kid and can't forgive myself for not being there with him, for not visiting more, for not spending more time with him more than anything, i hate myself for this since he's died i haven't been able to make myself visit his grave, i don't think my father has either, i hate it, i can't think about him without crying since high school, i've done nothing i have lupus, i'm so depressed that i literally have not left my house more than ten times in five years, three hospital visits, one funeral, my brothers graduation, and maybe my grand parents house for one or two holidays i'am absolutely fucking paralyzed with fear that my father, and other people i love, but especially him, will die i know that everyone in this world will die and that it is a part of life but rationality has no effect on my fear i still live with my father, i wake him up several times a night just to make sure he isn't dead i can't explain how posessed with this fear that i am i'm so ashamed, i'm so ashamed of what i'am that i just don't know how to get any sort of help i can't bring myself to tell my father about it i have no health insurance so i'm not really sure what my options would even be if i could bring myself to try to get help i'm so tired of living like this, i can't take it any more how do i change myself? how do i get free of this? if you made it through this, thank you for your time **tl;dr:** i'm depressed, my mother is terrible to me, i'm rendered completely inert by fear of my father and loved ones dying, i have lupus, no health insurance, uneducated, miserable and all of the

well for one i always feel apathetic towards life, towards people this is because i am afraid to feel anything else i never feel sympathy and when i do i try to avoid it i don't listen to any music unless i am extremely depressed i try everything i can to disguise my individuality i weir the same gray shirt with blue jeans every day to school i try everything in my power not to be noticed or express any divergence from the crowd of course this makes me stand out in some instances i am the kid who weirs the same cloths every single day and when asked why i truthfully reply, ""it’s easier this way"" this is true because i fret over the most insignificant things relating to those that have to do with appetence this isn't true for all though, i don't care about grades, i don't care about my opinions being struck down, in fact i love to argue but something about my individuality excluding my opinions causes extreme anxiety for me depression, i assume, is a common feeling after one makes a big mistake but for me everything is a big mistake especially with regard to social situations so every time i mess up a conversation, either because i am out of practice or get nervous during it and can't think, i feel like i have failed and enter a temporary depression that last the remainder of the day because my life is so dominated by addiction i feel that i do not have self control i feel like i am being pulled around by my id and super ego (i know it’s not commonly accepted anymore to divide the human mind in this way but it’s easier to explain this way) but i have no control i cannot go and say that i want to change this in my life so i am going to do this or something as simple as today i am going up to this person and saying hi, today i am going to finish my homework now! simple things are completely out of my reach free will i do not doubt it for i sent a ranting email to someone despite my super egos objections to it, and without any addiction motivation that was the furthers i have ever come to breaking the changes this lack of control leads to the fluctuating of me to the point that i am not me in 6 hours to make it more clear now i am person 1 in 6 hours i will be person 2 and maybe in another six i will be person 1 again i have a friend and my friendship with him is as important as anything i went to school with him sense 5 grades till my current 11th grade i understand his thoughts, i think; he wants to put me down to put himself up i am ok with it for i know what he says is true but it sometimes gets annoying everything i say every opinion contrary to his met with illogical criticism of my intelligence social life and success something that i ponder everyday is confirmed to be as big of failure as i believe it to be for example he constantly asks me what type of music i listen to he knows the answer i don't like any music, or so i say for expressing any individuality would make me open to criticism he then will say something along the lines of ""every lesions to music"" how can you not like music he goes through the history on my computer and laughs at things i have searched if i read smart stuff he will laugh at it i am only better at rock climbing in a jim in comparison to him and he won’t admit that it is so he will ask me what i have done over the weekend and i will reply with the truth that i have done nothing he then laughs at me despite already knowing the answer if he treats me so bad the only reason i hang out with him is because he has the exact same interests as me and i wouldn't have anyone else to do anything with when he isn't around tomorrow i might get a haircut my friend rightly pointed out that i will get the same haircut that will grow back bad because i am afraid of change ""that is the same reason why you weir that shirt everyday"" the truth is i am not afraid of change i am afraid of making a bad impression i am afraid of being stuck with a mistake i have realized my dream before of lying next to a girl it happened in costa rica when i wasn't afraid of what i said because i would be out of there in two weeks and in a bus ride i was laying next to her i would never do that in the states because i hate the glory and prize that seems to rest on women it’s like men are hunters and women are to be shot, stuffed and shown to their friends in order to prove their manlyness same applies if a man were to stuff a less impressive animal then he would be thought lets of so what i am really afraid of is being stuck with something that i cannot change, stuck with regret that i need to change in order to get on with my life so that i am make mistakes without suffering them more then i should",13,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dsc2e/depressed_huge_amounts_of_anxiety_and_lacking/,1287307952

dvlv2,depression,is_something_wrong,"what can you share about your own experience, given mine?","so, i'm a 20 year old guy, and i have some things i'd like to talk about and get some feedback on i should start by saying that i'm in one of the top 10 colleges in the country i'm of average height and average build (but not fit, the pot belly is evident in a t-shirt after a meal) i don't know if i'm good looking, i've never had anyone tell me so except for an internet person or two, but when i look in the mirror sometimes, i do think i am quite handsome at other times, i'm disgusted with the pictures that people have taken of me oh, and i have a loving and well educated family and some great opportunities ahead of me, if i don't continue to waste them anyways, the last month and a half has been *especially* depressing for me, mainly because the fact that i had never been in a relationship (with a girl) really ate into me a lot i realize that it's because i've never been in a relationship that i tend to idealize very much the grapes that i've never had are always sweeter so i made lame (i e /r/r4r, chatroulette, omegle, etc yeah, laugh) attempts at getting a relationship the defining characteristic of all these attempts was that they were all purely online, i never tried to meet up with or talk to someone who was physically near me this was because i could hide my flaws behind the wall of the internet all of it was also an emotionally rocky experience i'd get attached to the people i met very fast, i'd doubt myself, hate myself when i was ""rejected"", began to contemplate suicide, etc anyways, after spending the last five days almost constantly on omegle after coming back from school, with tag lines like ""i'm on a quest a quest for true love"", i finally realized how futile and ultimately self-betraying all of this was so yesterday and today, i spent time becoming who i used to be and who i used to be is not a better person, just an apathetic person i re-installed a few of the games i loved playing and pretty much distracted myself to the point where i actually don't care about the ""true love quest"" so much anymore yay? the thing is that for the last 2 years, after i started college i've rarely not hated myself i don't hate myself because of others, i hate myself because i have no willpower my first semseter in college was no shining achievement, but no grand failure either it was just one filled with homesickness (away for the first time) and laziness which eventually led to stress as the work would pile up the second term should have been better, i should have learned from my mistakes, but i didn't it too was no shining achievement i hated myself for being weak and repeating the same mistakes by the end of my first summer, i was pumped with hope for what i could do in my second year i started off the semester great, but after some good achievement in midterms, began to slack off again i finished the term with my best performance yet, but it would be the apogee of my achievement because ever since last year (in about mid-october) when i had started slacking off again, i have not been able to stop slacking off i spent my summer away from home, doing research at college, but it was an extremely depressing summer mainly because i had very little human contact (i shut myself in my room, never said high to my res-mates, ignored people who knocked on my door, etc ), because of my superbly low self-esteem after years of failure and my continued willingness to not put any effort as summer came to end, my depression began to tailspin one of the ways i'd distract myself from misery (i've never drank or smoked to distract myself, and i'm not interested in doing so) was by watching movies all movies have romance i have never had romance i was depressed notions began to take hold and grow, desperation was the fruit and the last month and a half but another harvest of regret add to this that because of the lack of much social activity in my life, over the past two years my personal hygiene habits have also degenerated my room is an absolute mess, during the worst times i have delivery sushi boxes a week old stacked where my textbooks should be, bags of chips all around my desk and laptop, papers everywhere, clothes everywhere, bags unpacked, etc etc i have picked up some terrible, terrible habits like picking my nose when i'm bored now which is extremely hard for me to admit even on here or not brushing my teeth regularly, etc about the only thing i do properly is that i shower often (every day or two), but i haven't washed my towel for a month and a half it's so despicable, i *hate* myself more than *anything* or *anyone* in the world but maybe what's really bad is that i think (perhaps falsely) that i'm semi-good at hiding my condition no one has ever cared to ask me if i'm okay, ever my parents of course are disappointed with my performance, and i've told them more of the truth about my condition of life recently, but i just avoid talking to them out of shame i feel extremely weak saying this, because i can't understand it without judging myself, and i don't expect anyone to understand it without judging me: but i have no hope for myself because i've proved again and again, that i am incapable of doing the right things at the right time for myself, leading again and again, to avoidable failure so, i'd like to hear your thoughts, particularly if you've gone through (or know someone about the experiences of someone who has gone through) similar stages of depravity and depression in your (their) life a question in particular i'd really like to have an answer to: are some people just, dare i say, *born* to fail regardless of the chances given to them?

(because the fact that i went from catholic, to public, to catholic, to public school had nothing to do with the type of education i received ) my mom has always compared me to my sister a lot (yet she denies it) my friends in high school saw how much she'd compare me to her and how proud she was of my sister and would question me about it, before i even brought it up she brags about my sister's artistic skills constantly and goes on and on about it, but of course me being without any talent, she has nothing to brag about she even admitted to me that she has a hard time explaining to people what i do for work, when i've explained my jobs to her several times in the past she talks about my sister even to *my* friends i can remember bringing over a friend and she just sat there talking about my sister the entire time and then after we left he said ""what was that all about? i never even met or spoke to your sister "" he also pointed out that she has several pictures displayed in the living room of my sister and her fiance, but none of me and my boyfriend (we've been together for 3 1/2 years) it's always been kind of obvious to me that she doesn't consider my relationship with my boyfriend as ""valid"" as my sister's relationship yesterday i went to their house and apparently my sister was getting her final fitting done there when i walked in, the seamstress was packing up to leave my mom came down stairs and said ""you missed all the fun!"" and i said ""that's ok "" and she said ""thanks "" sarcastically which made me question why she said that and she said ""for making it seem so unimportant!"" and i was really confused and said ""i'm sorry, i didn't know it was a requirement for me to be here for this?"" and she got really defensive and said ""it was a joke! you were supposed to take it as a joke!"" and i got frustrated and walked away and said ""whatever "" and she said ""that's better!"" this is not the first time she did something like this she always makes snide remarks and can never just say something nice and leave it at that after i got my last job that worked out, she said ""i'm happy for you, but if you don't end up liking it, can you *please* not leave until you have another job lined up?"" and it just aggravates me more because she seemed incredibly supportive of my decision to leave before, and only after i wasn't getting interviews for months did her opinion change yesterday, my dad gave me an article about hunting for jobs and i was reading it when he wasn't around and asked my mom why he was giving me an article like this when i already had a job and she said ""well in the past we know how your jobs start out great but then you hate them and leave, so he's just preparing you for the future "" and i just got so angry and said ""yes i know! you keep telling me things i have already thought about! i am in therapy and going to see a psychiatrist so please stop bringing things like this up!"" and she just snorted and said ""guess i've been told "" anyway, my therapist and i both agree that my family will never understand me or the things i struggle with internally they will never understand what it means to suffer from depression/anxiety my parents have never had problems loaning me money or helping me financially (but they still make me feel inadequate about it), but the understanding and emotional support has never been there i have come to the realization that i want to get them out of my life i don't want them in my life as much or at all, but my sister's wedding is in two weeks, so this will have to wait after the wedding, i'm not sure how to go about telling my family to stay out of my life i don't know how to tell them that they are what is keeping me from recovery and trying to feel better about myself i don't know if it would be permanent or temporary it's just really hard and confusing for me that my boyfriend and friends think i'm this strong amazing person for dealing with so much in my life (even stuff outside of my family issues), yet my family perceives me so differently and i know that once i say ""get out of my life"" (not necessarily in those words), that it will only further prove their perception of me (and my mom will play the guilt trip card), which i really don't want but i know at the same time after over a decade of dealing with this, they'll never understand me or the mental illness i get told there is nothing wrong with me by my boyfriend, friends, and therapist, yet my family constantly tells me or insinuates it as the opposite did anyone else here have to do something similar? what did you do? what were the results?",13,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dvp94/need_advice_about_my_family/,1287940879

dw7f2,depression,[deleted],the nature of depression and apathy,"i've been becoming increasingly antisocial, therefore i know that this is the only opportunity my thoughts will be given to exist outside of my mind i don't understand why i feel it's necessary that i not be the only one to know them, this isn't self consistent with anything i'm going to describe it may be important to note that this depressed state is entirely illogical this is what makes it interesting to me for all intents and purposes i have no rational reason to be in my current state of mind i'm young and healthy, i have a stable income and a stable home, i'm a graduate student and i'm intellectually stimulated, and there isn't anything in particular that can be deemed depressing about my life the sheer irrationality of it makes it all but impossible for me to find this at least to some degree thought provoking the foremost and also most interesting aspect of my current state of mind is the insurmountable internal swell of apathy that has been permeating into all aspects of myself allow me to elaborate through example the first activity i began losing interest in was any hobby of mine that i had previously enjoyed i used to be rather fond of tae kwon do, brewing, occasional rock climbing, and cooking those were the first things to begin to taper off with time, until i stopped participating in any of them all together to an even greater extreme, i've also lost all enthusiasm for food in general i've hardly been eating, and i'm largely apathetic to it i essentially only eat if the degree of starvation is such that it is causing irritating physical pain, making sleep difficult, or that i am becoming so light headed that i frequently feel as though i will faint while doing things as normally innocuous as standing up or riding my bike to the office this has caused me to lose nearly 30lbs, i was not overweight to begin with the next thing to begin wearing away was my enthusiasm for politics i had previously enjoyed staying current on political issues and found ideas in a political context intriguing and mentally stimulating i've been becoming apathetic to the degree that i no longer read news whatsoever, when i previously used to spend at least an hour a day and frequently more concerning myself with news and politics the next facet of my life to be broadly spattered with the indiscriminate heaving of apathy was any affection i previously had for my cats i have two two-year-old cats that i have become completely indifferent towards, possibly even further to the extent that i have begun to irrationally resent them i've decided that i am not capable of caring for them, and it is likely best that they be placed anywhere else i'm planning on giving them up to whichever nearby shelter will take them at first i had thought that i wanted to surrender them to a no-kill shelter, but i realized that these are universally packed to the gills right now, to such an extent that many no-kill shelters have begun surrendering their cats to kill shelters themselves i also realized a mildly disturbing truth, which is that i am emotionless regarding whether they survive or not the next chronological detail awash and crumbling in apathy is my enthusiasm for school work i'm in a competitive scientific graduate program, which i entered with a hearty devotion, and has subsequently been degraded into an irritation and inescapable nuisance i find myself reluctantly leaving my apartment to sit in my office, generally arriving late once there i find myself often staring at my work for large quantities of time, making no attempt to progress simply sitting, staring, and not thinking i've fallen behind on my work, to a degree that i'm not certain that i am capable of returning to the schedule i had hoped to keep to i don't particularly care if it gets done, and i don't particularly care if my work progresses my relationship with my family has also been suffering, and the degree to which i alienate them is growing with time i no longer talk to them voluntarily i used to either call one of my parents or my grandparents nearly every day that, or they would call me and i would be willing to hold a decent conversation after some time i stopped calling willfully now i don't answer if they call, or respond to messages or emails of any sort towards the end of talking to my parents, i would be surprisingly hostile now i feel it's best if i stop communication entirely the last, and by far the most painful, aspect of my life to be swathed in the now universal and inescapable indifference is my relationship with my long term girlfriend we've been together for nearly 4 years now, and are currently maintaining our relationship at a distance we had been talking about getting married some time in the next few years i moved a considerable distance to pursue my graduate education, and so now we hardly see each other i used to talk with her at least once a day, trying to video chat as much as possible then i started losing interest in the video chats next i stopped wanting to hold a conversation on the phone, and communicated in short text messages now i've stopped communicating entirely i had previously been very optimistic about our future, hoping that sooner or later she would move in and we could continue our previous course of things when we used to live together now i'm losing that hope, and bit by bit the image of my future is being blotched with only a bleak and solitary future it's becoming difficult to imagine anything else for me now my enthusiasm for any facet of my life is essentially dissolved into the vast expanses of apathy i've begun becoming indifferent to my waking hours, spending more time asleep than ever the sleep, however, is not very sound in reality i feel poorly rested perpetually, even though my time spent sleeping has increased dramatically it's generally fragmented and unsatisfying because of this, i spend my waking hours inundated with a dense haze enveloping my thoughts and actions i feel as though i'm losing my mind, and my behavior has become erratic and unusual the strangest part of this ordeal is that i am not optimistic about improvement and don't particularly care if it happens even though i am thoroughly aware of the degree to which my state has worsened, i'm not agitated by it and have no motivation to reverse it this is a very strange series of events that has been transpiring for me, and one to which i can offer no explanation i don't feel that i am capable of understanding it, and that in itself is something that i find interesting it seems by definition impossible it's rather eerie to consider that once this course of action is put into motion, it becomes nearly absurd to consider any alternative as it is a self-feeding process, which will irreversibly progress forward until every possible consumable is enveloped resection of the rot requires the rot to first be cured i've entered a paradox, which may be why this seems at least mildly interesting i appreciated collecting my ideas, and laying them out in a chronological progression, if for no other reason than for the sake of organization i feel as though i have a greater definition of the issue at hand, even if i can generate no further comprehension for the reason among the nonsense",7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dw7f2/the_nature_of_depression_and_apathy/,1288032986
dwc91,depression,Betterbee,help taking the first step,"hey reddit, (23yr old male - australia) this is not my first post on reddit, but i've never really opened up to people about my depression i've recently started making some small steps, i opened up to a friend about some of the things on my mind, and she surprised me by how accepting she was about the thing si have done (these are personal failings i am referring to i've not filled out a tax return since i started working, flunked out of uni because i was too scared of going to classes, and started lieing to my, then, girlfriend and family about my life situation i maintained that i was still in uni, but eventually broke down and confessed to my girlfriend about what had happened it damaged the relationship, she was understandbly hurt but stuck with me but the confrontation didn't help me and i fell further into the same patterns to 'protect' myself against the shame of anyone else knowing about my failings eventually i managed to push my girlfriend away enough the she broke up with me, and i crashed i stopped going to work, and just stayed in my room i lost my job, my lease, i aquired about $500 in debts to utility companies which i still have as of yet to pay off (tanked my credit rating) and had to move back in with my parents for a year even when living with them i couldn't open up and talk about my problems my dad tried to get me on centrelink for which i was eligible after a while, but i tried to deceive him, i said i'd put in paper work for my application when i hadn't there was no reason not to, besides my own feelings of shame and guilt i was a burden on my parents, and i wanted desperately to get back on my feet and find a job but i was in not position to do such a thing (my dad lives on a stretch of isolated highway in the country) centrelink was the best option as i could at least give a little back, but something about being back on the doll terrified me like it was a step backwards, like i was a kid fresh out of school so i lied, held out until he found out and then there was a shit storm before i moved to my mums things were a bit better here - i got on centrelink, a doc put me on medication for depression, and i started to get back on track emotionally i went off the meds after 8 months as it didn't feel like they were helping it's been two years since then and i've though that i was making progress, but i realise i haven't changed and i still carry the demons around with me worse still i look at myself today and i have no life so to speak i've stopped contacting all my friends, given up on making new ones, i dont even think about women in a serious way anymore at least i wouldn't inflict my company on one for whom i had any real feelings i go to work and i come home and sit on my computer i realise i don't even browse the web for a coherent prupose or hobby i just vacuum up whatever vaguely interesting information i come across on reddit last night my sis and brother in law were devising ways i could approach a girl at work who's cute i said maybe 5 words for that whole conversation, and all i wanted to do was open up to them and explain who i am and what i'm feeling but i couldn't and i didn't how do i tell them that i find myself crying in the sheds at work when no one is around? that i can't think seriously about a girl because what kind of relationship can i offer someone else when i can't manage my own affairs? i guess i'm just tired of it all i look back to the person i was even 5 years ago and i don't see the resemblence anymore i would like to start seeing a therapist but i'm out country and have no licence to get around so i guess i'm asking for help and advice if you've got any to spare, reddit i don't know what to do, and i think it's time to admit that i'm terrified that this is person condemned to be for the rest of my life i'm sorry for the wall of text, and despite it all i'm sure i've breezed over a lot but any help from you guys and girls would be unreal thank you in advance and i apologise for the formatting, grammar, etc - i had to type this on my iphone from work tldr i've spent years keeping everything in and it's destroying me i need to open up to my family - they're the most important thing to me inthe world and i'm driving them away please help me find a way to open up",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dwc91/help_taking_the_first_step/,1288051473

edit: one more thing i noticed is, i tend to compare my knowledge of one technology with others and i get disappointed that i cannot be on the same level as them and when i try to, i get overwhelmed by all the stuff i need to know, and just give up then and there edit: i do have other interests: automotive, architecture, structural engineering, boxing **original post (no need to read)** before i applied for the job, i totally cleaned up my resume, made it ""fit"" for the requirements, wrote a very specific cover letter, etc long story short, i gave it my best now, after a phone interview, i was told i did not pass because my conversational skills are not that good, although i did great on the written part i gave it my best and i failed i failed at life i am not good at anything, in fact, i do not have any strengths i am a mediocre person i know a bit of everything, i do not have any special talents how do i get back to society? how do i pull myself up? this all happened after getting rejected by a girl (i went to visit her, traveled to a different country, and she ended up with another guy who i found out played her later) i have very few friends but they are not here, in california i want to go back home but i can't not enough savings, and i still have around $2,000 debts, credit card and personal, not to mention the money needed for the plane tickets i don't know, i'm confused i am basically writing anything that comes to mind i'm afraid of what's coming to me in the future i don't want this life anymore i am sick of being very non-sociable, but i cannot find anyone else to talk to one of my best friend (and the only friend i have here in california) is always hanging out with his gf i call myself a programmer, yet, i cannot or do not even have one finished program i give up too easily if i get bored or encounter a difficult problem i do not have any reason to live",57,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dxl4v/my_interviewer_told_me_i_did_not_pass_because_i/,1288248894

dxs5b,depression,uncletbag,overwhelmed,"hi, everyone this is my first post on reddit; i've been having a tough time recently and i just wanted to share i'm one of those people who has a tough time discussing things like this with my family/friends perhaps i should begin with where i was one year ago, and where i am today i would kind of like just to get it all out there and never talk about it again one year ago, i tried to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation i grew up in a conservative environment in the south, and that, in many ways, shaped an intense self-hatred that developed for 24 years during that time, i tried to cope with my problems by ignoring them after a number of failed relationships with girls, i honestly planned on remaining in the closet and being alone forever in college i had the opportunity to be myself, but i shut myself down and refused to admit that i was gay of course, the loneliness and isolation that i felt ate away at me year after year when i graduated college and began my first job, my friends all began getting married and starting families, which only intensified my feelings of loneliness when things reached a breaking point, i decided that i should try and deal with my sexuality once and for all, so i came out to my best friend at the time (who worked at the same company) unfortunately, he did not react well he told me that it didn't bother him, but we stopped hanging out after that the worst part is that he outed me to several of my coworkers after that, a once friendly work environment became awkward and tense i felt more isolated than ever i had given up hope of ever finding a positive solution to my problem, so i decided to kill myself i bought a nitrogen tank, some trash bags, a hose and some sleeping pills i planned everything out, i didn't want my death to be messy because i didn't to hurt my family more than i had to i said goodbye to my friends and family (via text, of all things), took a fistful of sleeping pills, and turned on the gas death was supposed to arrive in five minutes, but the sleeping pills didn't kick in i couldn't keep the bag over my head without instinctively pulling it off again due to the feeling of suffocation fifteen minutes later, the cops showed up at my door, and i was taken to a mental health facility for a week i quit my job after that (my boss to this day doesn't know why i quit other than “medical reasons”), and i moved back in with my folks after that, things got so much better my folks were supportive of me in every way i stayed with them for almost a year because i couldn't find another job but during that time, i started dating my first boyfriend was a pilot, and we were together for 8 months we had both never dated another guy before, and, as weird as i'm sure it sounds to some of you, there was something very sweet and innocent about the whole thing looking back, those were some of my happier times of my life it was tough not being able to work, but it was nice to have something that i thought i would never have the work thing is what eventually drove us apart, i believe i had nothing to do all day, i spent time working out and playing games, but it's like he and i were not on equal footing i felt inadequate and i'm sure that came across i would often be negative, because i was stressed about not working we ended up drifting apart it is hard to watch someone who once cared about you slowly lose that spark the relationship ended somewhat “mutually,” but honestly i was, by far, more hurt by the whole thing he was the one good thing in my life at that time fast forward to a few months after our break-up, and i am enrolled in grad school i finally have a thing, i don't feel lost but at the same time, he has moved to the middle east to work for an airline out there and, as much as i hate to say it, has in many ways forgotten about me he mentioned before he left that maybe we could start over in three years when he returns to the us, but i know in my heart that that won't happen if he really wanted to be with me, he would have stayed grad school is stressful i live far away from campus and don't have any time to be social most of my classmates are pretty serious, and i haven't made any good friends like i did when i was an undergraduate i spend most of my time driving between school and my part-time tutoring job and, at the moment, i feel overwhelmed i am incredibly lonely i don't want to slip back into the depression that dealt with for 24 years, but i am having trouble coping with a life that is all work and no fun i haven't been able to get over my last relationship because i haven't had anything to move on with i don't have any real friends here unfortunately i want to make time to meet people, but most of my efforts have been thwarted by my schedule i feel like i am on the verge of cracking last night, i stayed up all night completing an assignment and when i came home i crashed into a ball and asked myself “who am i doing this for? where is this going to take me?” meanwhile, i see pictures of my ex on fb enjoying his new life, traveling the world with his friends and possible new interests i can't help but look at my life and become incredibly depressed my life is a lab underground it is books and homework and loneliness i feel abandoned by him, and everyone else i want to stay positive, i want to push forward i just don't know how much more i can do in these circumstances i feel like i'm always pushing a boulder away anyway, that was incredibly long i

no, but they found the strength to make it through, day by day you have clearly found that strength, and you must keep making it through, day by day by day **2 i'm blowing everything out of proportion ** you are absolutely not blowing things out of proportion you are going through a very, very difficult time in your life back to the athlete/chess player/rockstar example, some people make their living with their heads, some with their bodies, and all those are valid mental struggles are just as important and valid as physical struggles you are going through mental hell if you were going through physical hell, your wounds would be more visible, you'd probably get more sympathy, people wouldn't be as quick to judge and yet you're going through a mental struggle now, which is just as much of a struggle and just as difficult to bear some of you are going through both mental and physical struggles, and others too (spiritual, etc) you have it so tough but think of how brave you are that you've made it so far, alive **3 i'm the worst piece of shit who has ever lived i should just do the world a favor and take myself out of the world ** do you blame a person with a cleft lip for their disability? should you deny the handicapped disability access to buildings? no, because we recognize that some people have problems which are beyond their control and which we shouldn't fault or blame them for you have something which is affecting the way you function and the way you view the world, as you know by the sheer fact that you're here, and your priorities now shouldn't be on comparing yourself to other people, or overanalyzing how you treat them, but on getting through people are very forgiving i'm sure you forgive people all the time for things that are outside their control so why are you so hard on yourself? there are things happening in your head which are outside your control and trust me, friends, family, even acquaintances and strangers can be more forgiving and understanding than we often give them credit for besides, when you do end up making it through, you are going to be so much of a stronger person for having had survived this **4 everyone else is doing so well; look how happy they are ** everyone is fighting their own battles, to greater or lesser extents often we don't even know until someone really lets us inside, but the most well-adjusted people i've met have sometimes confessed to me stories of depression, desperation, abuse, and despair which does *not* mean that they all understand what you're going through you're not just depressed, you can't just get over it with some chocolate and a movie but many of them at least understand what it's like to feel so low you think you'll never get out, and many are putting on a brave face just the same way you are an estimated 10% of americans have some kind of diagnosable mental illness often it's hard to find other people who feel like you do, but support groups and even online groups like this one can really help to make you feel like you're not the only person suffering in a world of cheerful, happy people who are ""somehow"" doing better **5 it'll never get better ** it can i promise you're going to have to trust me i made it through with the help of friends, family, therapy, and meds it was never easy but i'm here now, graduating from a good school and doing okay on most days the most important thing is, i'm still here there were times when the only thing keeping me going was luck, and if that's all you got, then cultivate it -- do any of you have anything to add?

spent most of my daycare time off in a corner looking at my hands, or generally behaving autistically **age 4** - fell off a low balcony and landed directly, 180 degrees on my head; i went to the hospital for concussion and i don't remember anything from my stay beyond flashes of plastic curtains and confusion - failed to make friends or feel included in kindergarten **age 6 / grade 1** - got locked in my school's pool changing room after the after-school swimming lessons, presumably because everyone forgot i was there my mom had to somehow get the attention of the janitor so that i could be let out -

i become the second-smartest kid in the class when a new kid shows up and becomes my new best friend he and another common friend of ours go biking all the time and play videogames and micro machines and whatnot - i get an n64 for christmas and begin my spiral into videogame obsession i also get my first tastes of starcraft, doom, quake, half-life, and counter-strike during this year, making one other friend in the process **grade 7** - sex ed; we're shown an overhead of the vagina, which i have never seen or even though much of before, and i pop an insta-boner this is the only thing that assures me i'm not gay (not that i have a problem with other people being gay) -

e2gn8,depression,K-Bar,how to inspire myself with depression?,"sorry for all the posts it makes me kinda feel like a tool, but its the only place i can actually get stuff off my chest i can't keep up with any hobby or passion with depression i end up discouraging myself before i even start thinking ""what's the point? at this rate, it'll all be pointless anyway "" i want to start working out again i was doing great in my last year of college, but once spring quarter started, my depression got worse, and i stopped doing it now, its about six months later, and i'm still in the same place i really want to start again, but i can't seem to find the motivation anymore one big worry is that if i did it, and achieved that body i've always wanted, that's all i'll have a hot body (which is argumentative, since i have nf1, and although its a minor case, bumps all over the tummy is probably a turn off to a lot of people i don't know many that could get past something like that) i'll have an ok body with a not okay face that if i lose weight, no man/woman (i'm pansexual) still will not want me i'm pretty androgynous, so i get mistaken for a guy a lot one because of my voice (but i can't do anything about that i used to think a deep voice was kinda sexy to some, but i doubt it really) two, because my face really isn't all that feminine i'm a tomboy, but if i suddenly try methods to glam it up, it will just look wasted and awkward on me i'm insanely jealous of people who aren't skinny, but are still cute and attractive i know the whole excuse about ""personality"" does a lot, but i think outside of depression, i have a great personality (which more than enough people have said to me) and obviously, at 22 and never even being kissed, its not true at least for me but aside from all of this, i still need to do it i just can't find my inspiration to do it but, i'm imagining its my only shot at ever finding someone who's interested in something more than a friendship, i just need the support to do it **edit:** i've been thinking about this thread i hated posting it, because after the support, i feel a lot better than i did a minute ago i think i do need to just force myself to make myself happy happier at least i can enjoy the simple moments in life listening to music or writing a movie script like i did last night its fun, and it makes me feel good i need to realize that small moments like that is what makes happiness, not looks i need to start focusing on what i am, what i have physically, and work with it i'm not ugly i think i'm pretty average (seems like the only time i get hit on though, is by creepy, old, homeless guys) i do need to make some changes, but if i want to be a 'tomboy' then i can be one i constantly get told i can't, and that's not what a lady should do, but what do they know about me? i'm friendly, funny, sensitive and pretty damn compassionate (for people other than myself at least) i don't see how wearing heels emphasizes that i've meet a lot of glam gals that are huge bitches and no redeemable personality at all true, they may get attention for their looks, but that's all it is for the looks i want something special i'm fairly low maintenance, but i want have a body that looks good, not really for me, but for the person i may be able to attract with it i want to be attractive to at least someone, because that way it would be a major intensive to keep it up i'm a pansexual, but i do lean more in the direction of the ladies i'm not ""butch"" by any means, but having a bit of muscle for cuddle purposes is a plus for me i'm a nurturer, what can i say? that was a major stream of consciousness uh, thanks for the people that responded i feel like i should delete my comments, since i didn't really believe in my words anyway, but that seems fake i wrote them, i shouldn't have to hide it ignorance can only be fixed if you are aware of it, i guess thanks reddit you guys and gals rock and roll all night sweet suzie",28,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2gn8/how_to_inspire_myself_with_depression/,1289132703
e2jfh,depression,SonLostInLife,my 30 yo son has dropped out of my life i worry about him and it's creating a festering wound in my own life,"(i will try to be as concise as possible but i'm very emotional ) my older son is almost 30 and has never found a life this is about him as a child he was bright and athletic and terribly shy he was also incredibly well behaved too much so - i remember telling him to put the books away and go play from the time he was a preschooler he dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot in middle school i had to take him to meet with a teacher so that he could understand that when she said she wanted a ""professional effort"" she wasn't addressing him but trying to motivate the rest of the class he met his best friend of many years at that time he was a natural athlete with local soccer teams trying to ""recruit"" him when he was 10 he loved soccer and even though his father and i divorced when he was 4, his father made sure that he could afford to play for any team that he wanted through high school he played soccer and studied hard, taking university classes during his junior year during his junior year his father stepped up and said he'd help our son with the air force academy application process his father is a great schmoozer and successful businessman so they had dinner with the local recruiter and all the requirements were carefully spelled out for them during the latter half of his junior year i started getting calls from his father asking me to nudge our son to complete paperwork or take other action necessary for the usafa application process i could tell that our son was dragging his feet so i asked if he was certain that he wanted to attend usafa he maintained he was and even refused to submit applications to other schools with high act and sat scores, he was getting offers from schools, sight unseen, for a free ride still he wouldn't apply anywhere else his senior year he signed up for 1 class at his high school and the rest at the u it took 2 weeks for me to realize that he wasn't spending any time at home on homework i knew he had free time on campus and thought he was doing his work there but i finally asked him about it 20 questions later i learned he had been getting up, showering and dressing, and heading out to ""school "" only he didn't go to school; he waited until i was gone to work and went home he quit school at that point while shocked, i realized that not every kid does everything in traditional ways and this was certainly not a traditional kid while his father was flabbergasted, i knew that i couldn't force him to attend school so i told him he had a choice: school or get a job he promptly got a job we met with his hs counselor who was willing to work him into classes at that late date but he refused and kept working then, of his own accord, he scheduled an appointment with his counselor and reentered high school for the 2nd semester due to his college credits from his junior year he was able to graduate with the rest of his class before i found out that he had quit school, he continued to get dressed up and interviewed with congressional types in his quest to attend usafa i asked him why he did that if he wasn't going to finish hs his reply: they said great things about him and it felt good well, he was rewarded he received appointment letters from every congressional type he met he had his choice of any military school in the us but they all respected his first choice and listed usafa first he went to usafa that summer his letters to me were frequent and increasingly depressed (forgot to mention that as someone with chronic major depression, i recognized that he, too, was depressed ) when i received a letter talking about his thoughts of suicide i didn't know what to think, do, or say i wrote to him every single day, driving nearly an hour one way to the airport post office if necessary to ensure that a letter went out every day i wrote with all the encouragement i could but when he finally was allowed to call home (dooley day out) his talk was all about getting out of there but he was worried about what his father would say i contacted other mothers of basic cadets who suggested i contact a chaplain as they have unfettered access to the cadets while my son is an atheist, it felt like the safest way to have someone there visit and talk to him to learn his true state of mind about a week later i received a call saying that i should pick up my son at the airport with flight info it turns out that he was very sick with strep and had a fever of 103 deg when they moved him to the infirmary as the first step of processing him out had my call to the chaplain triggered his discharge when in reality he was just sick and needed treatment? i'll never know he has had all kinds of ups and downs, mostly downs, since then at one point i was able to insist that he seek counseling he knew he was suffering from depression and agreed to speak honestly to the psychiatrist i left it up to him whether to take meds if they were recommended my primary goal was to ensure he didn't have to wait the usual 6-8 weeks to see a psychiatrist for the first time if he experienced a crisis he tried meds (this was a number of years ago) and said they helped a little but he wasn't interested in them as long as he maintained contact and i could visit him from time to time i felt that he was ok he's had 2 failed attempts to attend college he cut his father out of his life for at least a year or 2 along the way and now, this year, when his younger brother graduated from college, he cut me out too he refuses to respond to any communications from me i have trouble periodically worrying about him i can kind of push it to the back of my mind a lot of the time but recently it's been harder to keep it there the absence of him in my life is like a festering wound that i can't seem to heal this is something that i would never have expected in my wildest imaginings we didn't have a fight but, looking back, i can see that i haven't known him (not for lack of trying) for nearly 15 years he keeps all emotion to himself i don't know how to reach him i don't know if i should keep trying i don't know how to go about my own life without periodic depressive episodes when i realize that another month or holiday has gone by with no word from him i am just coming up from a day from hell yesterday i completely crumbled into the pit but i knew it was centered solely around my concern about my son today i'm very shaky i don't know any other parents whose adult child has done severed ties in this manner so i don't know what possible outcomes there are i don't have any more ideas about how to breach the divide i write short, cheerful notes from time to time i leave brief, upbeat messages on his phone occasionally i sent an invitation to come for thanksgiving and/or christmas and asked that he let me know i've asked that he just email or im me and let me know if he's ok the silence is deafening about me - i'm clear about my depression i have great medical care for it and take meds regularly i know that if it weren't for the meds i'd be suicidal when i was a small child (as young as age 5 or 6) i frequently wished i had never been born or when i went to bed i would ""pray"" that i wouldn't wake up it's genetic and it's strong does anyone have any ideas? any experience with a situation like mine? thanks, if you've read this far tl;dr my (depressed) son has completely shut me out of his life i'm scared for him and it's eroding my own life **edit** - omg, i just realized how much i made this about my suffering i guess that's because it's my suffering that drove me to post my suffering, though, is secondary to my son's if i knew that he was doing ok and just didn't want me in his life right now, i think that would be much easier to deal with i suspect there is still something he needs from me but damn_it_so_much seems to have hit the nail on the head i can only guess but i think he might want to handle life on his own and sees seeking help as yet another ""failure"" to add to his perceived list of failures through his sports and other events when he was growing up i tried to teach that ""failures"" are a natural part of life and mostly learning experiences of course, guesses and thinking don't identify the problem(s) or issue(s) he's having i also see how jumbled my original post was to clarify - i'm very proud of son he has worked hard and, i suspect, struggled too much i admire and respect him as well i was well into my 30s before i was diagnosed with depression so i know how hard that fight is it feels to me like he is fighting other battles, ones that he won't/can't share with me **edit2** - i am beyond words with gratitude for the opportunity to ""talk"" about this issue with such a broad range of people your honesty and your insights are all important because i know that i have to make a decision that i can live with for now i lacked thoughts from people who could look at the situation from different perspectives also, a special thank you for those who protested my deletion i hadn't looked at my post from your perspectives i'm accustomed to seeing eyes glaze over when i talk about this with the few friends and family who know me well; i didn't want to add something of less than no value to reddit and expected a lot less than i received any other comments, perspectives are still very much welcome i will be checking here frequently thanks, all of you",43,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2jfh/my_30_yo_son_has_dropped_out_of_my_life_i_worry/,1289150693

e2s0j,depression,sundaryourfriend,some css magic to better indicate the motivating posts from those asking for help?,"there are mainly two kinds of posts on this subreddit: those from depressed people asking for help, and those from helpful people providing resources that might help these posts are also intended for entirely different audiences: the first kind towards the people who post the second kind, and vice versa so my suggestion is that we separate these two kinds of posts by some visual indication so that it reaches the right audience as someone recovering from depression, i have to admit that there have been quite a few times when i've come to this subreddit for solace, only to have my negative thinking reaffirmed by others in depression, and have ended up worse than before one thing to note is that it is probably too much to ask people in mounting pain to remember to mark their posts with something every time so i'd propose that posts are by default considered to be someone asking for help, unless it's tagged by some magic phrase something like [resource] feels right (with [request] being the optional counterpart), though it perhaps is not too clear - what do you think? also, the phrase by itself may be useful, but coloring the posts differently or some other similar magic might be even more useful if we agree on some good way of doing this, we might post the request to r/somebodymakethis and get it done edit: it would be awesome if it's possible to dim out the negative posts by default (implicitly assuming a person is here asking for help) and ""undim"" them after we check something like ""i'm a volunteer, no problem for me"" the folks at r/android are doing all sorts of magic with css and getting input from users about carriers, etc , so a simple volunteers/others checkbox shouldn't be a problem i hope",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2s0j/some_css_magic_to_better_indicate_the_motivating/,1289192418

e2umj,depression,23YearOldGuy,i really don't feel like the person i used to be or anywhere close the person i want to be,"i really don't know where to start and i lost track on how often i tried to write this down already so here it goes the last 5 years of my life have been one big mess i'm 23 years old now and got thrown out of my parents apartment the summer after i turned 18 i had never cared for myself for and before my mothers disvorce my life was going perfect and there was never a mention of me going out the house that early, i diddn't even have problems at home i bounced around at friends while i tried to stay in college without even having school books i got a place of my own and dropped out 2 months later because i could not pay for school and my apartment at the same time after dropping out i got kicked out of my apartment and stayed at my friend for a good year i found a girlfriend and she offered me to move in with her and this was the greatest time of my life, i was able to make some money every month and pay the rent the year following our breakup my life went downhill really fast mett the wrong people, noticed that my old friends did not have any interest in my anymore and got depressed i was behind on my rent for 5 months i often wouldn't eat anything for 2-4 days obviously i got kicked out after a while and i called my real dad who was living in another country if i could stay with him for a while till i sorted out some stuff moving there for a while was the best decision i could have made because the only alternative would have been being homeless i lived there for 2 years and it was a living hell my dad did not have a job, was an alcoholic and would come into my room a few times every week telling me how much of a shitty son i was i managed to make a bit of money and wanted to save it for school or at least to get the fuck out of there, but whenever he noticed he took at least half because he needed to pay the ""rent"" too and no pay would mean he would kick me out the best thing he ever did was laugh into my face and told me i was an idiot after i sat down with him and told him i was feeling depressed all the time because of we how we where threating eachother after that happened i really did not give a shit anymore, i took unwanted risks in order for me to get away from him, make his life worse if possible and just hope he will forget me last december i told him i was going to leave to the netherlands (home country) by februari 2010 by any means even if it would mean i would have to be homeless i made a few calls to my mom and she told me my stepdad did not want to have me there anymore fine by me, i would leave anyways i did something i am good at and something i only resort to in moments like these, something i hate myself for and i made about 500 euros illegally i send another email to my mom which must have sounded quite suicidal (not on purpose) because she mailed me the same day and even called me that it was ok to stay there for a few weeks i moved there and slept on the ground on a make shift bed made out of blankets for the following 4 months till i was able to afford a matress i would never really talk to my parents at all this summer i made some decent money over the internet and saved it up to get my own apartment from where i am writing this post right now my life seemed pretty much on track i had bills and debts but that was the least of my concern, i was getting money each month and was able to pay for my rent and food even tho everything sounds perfect i really don't know if i could feel any shittier the last 4 years have been a living hell for me and even tho my life is going great i am still suffering from it i can't relate to nobody anymore people just seem to be like everyday objects to me living their life, i don't really care what they think or what they do or what their opions are and it saddens me people want to be my friends now but whenever i hang out with them i want them to leave as soon as possible so i can be alone by myself in those last 4 years i have turned into this social awkward blob of insecure person that i hate before i could walk around feel great, flirt with girls and talk up random people right now i feel like everybody that doesn't know is avoiding me for me being me, and girls aren't even looking because i'm probably pretty ugly =/ i started talking to my ex i dated in highschool a few months ago, we would talk for 5-10 hours a day over skype and had an awesome time but then when she asked me if she could meet me again for a booty call (yes) i pussied out and came up with mistakes, and then another and another time since i diddn't want her to see me i bought a webcam and we started to cam, after the first day she stopped talking to me and i took a huge hit because this just comfirms that i'm indeed not the person i was a few years ago last week i made an appointment with a physchologist and he will be calling me next week i think its a step into the right direction but i have no clue where to start talking about my problems and my thoughts i could write them down but then i still don't know where to talk since i feel that there is so much wrong with me =/ right now i feel pretty depressed but i have never really been suicidal i'm always thought about saving that if i ever reach a point of no return whats funny is that i have been talking about suicide and killing myself since i have been 10 or 12 whenever somebody would ask me how i thought i would die i would answer that i would throw myself of a building or shoot myself trough the head at the age of 50 =/ well not that funny perhaps i exercise each day and have a pretty healthy diet but the main thing concerning me is how i look, what i wear and what other people think about me even tho when they think something about me i do not care i also have no sense of fashion to make it worse i have a closet of 50 almost identically looking stuff some of them are really thight fitting stuff and some of them are baggy and i just mix them **so thats my story** i really don't know why i am posting this here but its something i needed to get off

e3h3h,depression,isthereawayout,please advise,"to begin, not new to reddit just made a new account for the sole purpose of trying to get some help/ideas also i'm sorry this is probably going to get pretty long i think it started when i was very young, but i think for protective reasons i don't remember much of my childhood i was bullied everyday i was in elementary school physically, verbally, i don't really remember a day where i didn't cry myself to sleep, which unfortunately made my brother whom i shared a room with all my life aware that i was upset but he was only a grade below me so when we went to school it seemed like everyone knew i was upset, which seemed to make me an even bigger target i am shocked to this day at how purely evil kids can be fast forward to middle school, nothing really changed except now i played soccer i was no good at all, to this day i am really no good but now i had to spend an extra hour with my peers, who all seemed to hate me they bullying still never stopped it just got worse, but i could see that their were other people who were no good at soccer and were taking shit from the teammates as well i thought we could band together and protect ourselves, but being the manipulative children todays society creates, the good players were able to quit picking on some kids just so that they would pick on the others for them, the cycle was never ending, i always wanted to quit but my parents would never let me quit unless i joined something else while in middle school i was finally able to find friends that i truly cared about and to this day they truly care about me while in middle school my best friend went through this cutting phase i can still remember the day i went over to his house to play and we were in his kitchen when he snapped in front of me and his mom he grabbed a knife and started cutting his arm me and my friends did our best to try to help him and something we did must have worked because now he is just a normal college kid, he has lost much of the darkness that seemed to plague him when we were younger moving on to highschool, the bullying in sports got out of hand one of the upperclassman who was picked on ended up getting severely injured because of a senior the senior had the kid get in the back of his truck for whatever reason he slammed on his brakes send the kid in the bed flying he had to get a steel plate inserted into his skull because of what had happened about two weeks ago i found out that the kid had taken his life, stating he felt he didn't belong it baffled me, he had gone to college graduated and landed a job working for the university he attended yet he still felt he didn't belong in this world the hazing got so bad the administration for the school district had a talk with our team about what was going on, but it did nothing in 11th grade, i finally got a girlfriend, i loved her she loved me i was so afraid of not knowing what to do with her though that we never even kissed i was paralyzed by my fear of something new, that i had never done before it is my understanding that this is why we broke up but i really do not know, i have never gotten closure from the incident and i don't think i ever will but we broke up in october of my senior year since that moment i have not made a positive choice in my life maybe after a week of being broken up with my girlfriend i began to date her best friend that made my ex hate me, we are on ok terms right now but we really don't keep in contact i let my new girlfriend lead the way because i was so paralyzed by my fear of the unknown it got to the point where everyone said i was whipped, which i don't dispute, i stayed with her for i think three years, we graduated and i went to a local college with no idea as to what i wanted to do with my future my parents never saved a dime for any of us to go to college but i don't blame them for that since i had been born my family had always lived with my grandparents my parents had four kids and my dad was the only one who worked my oldest sister(four years older then me) had her first kid at 17(my mom had her at 15 me at 19 brother at 20 and youngest sister at 21) my freshman year in highschool we moved in with my moms best friend for a few months because my grandfather has always been an alcoholic we eventually found a place near our school and we began to pay rent on a house that was always too small for us my senior year my family found out that our dad had an affair with my moms best friend my parents are still together but i hate my dad for that i hate my mom for the fact that she hasn't worked a job in 20 years and we really have never been making it anyway i began going to a community college, i took out a 20,000 grand loan, i payed for one year of school 8,500$ after aid ,bought a cheap 400 dollar laptop and a cheap 2,000$ car, the rest of that money was spent by my parents for the family i assume because i found out when i went to go for my second year the money was gone i was angry at my parents angry at my girlfriend, angry at everyone, i just wanted to get away i managed to move to pittsburgh to go to an artschool i couldn't afford i used my girlfriends parents to cosign my student loans i went for half a year, met a wonderful girl and began to cheat on my girlfriend, she found out and i had to drop out to this day she would still take me back but i hate her so fucking much i can't put it into words sometime while i was in pittsburgh i got a parking ticket which unknowingly became outstanding and my license was suspended, after a night of heavy drinking with one of my buddies i got a ride out to his car while he was still passed out and drove it home where we had been staying, on my way home, a guy ran a stop sign and tboned me from the drivers side i got my license further suspended and added some medical bills to my outstanding debt i totaled up my debt from my life so far, i am currently 21 years old with 80000 in debt plus intrest i have no clue what to do, i am still living with my parents working for my dad some days but making no money working with my dad keeps me in the house and keeps my cellphone paid the heat in my room doesn't work the ceiling about my bed is cracking and leaking and getting worse every time it rains my brother moved out, he is a welder getting shit pay but its enough to get him by with his girlfriend my little sister is now joining the military because she realized this year(her sophomore year) that she can't afford school on her own either basically i need some advice on how to change my situation i am currently on probation and should be getting off the 17th assuming i can find a way to pay the 1200 i now owe the court system, i got probation for having one marijuana pipe in my pocket when my friend got pulled over(same friend whom i totaled his car even though the other guy ran the stop sign) i just feel like my whole life i have been getting shit on i have ideas on what to do, stage my death and run away to europe, try to save up enough money to declare bankruptcy and join the army(not the most physically fit), but really i have no idea what i am doing with my life, now or in the future i haven't had sex in like two years now, i just fucking hate my life i've lost everything i owned, my car, my tv, my xbox, my good relationships everyone else got out of this god awful town and i can't do it all i have left now is a few outfits 5 pairs of socks, one set of worn out sneakers and this broken laptop please someone try to give me

this is all i deserve i'm so sick of society i'm sick of classism i'm sick of seeing people who are born without the same opportunities as other people, and yet we claim that everyone is born equal and has the same opportunities in life i'm sick of the glorification of people who ""succeed,"" when so much of the time, they actually were given lucky circumstances and are simply standing on the backs of others i'm sick of ""money doesn't buy happiness,"" yet money buys freedom and power over your life, and that does in fact lead to happiness i'm sick of a capitalist system where a tiny few gorge themselves with wealth they've stolen from the work of others i'm tired of being a slave to a system i can't possibly change or move within the more i struggle, the more i seem to be ensnared i always think about brave new world, where the number of people is engineered to match the number of various positions available no one complains about picking up garbage, because the people picking up garbage don't have the capacity to do or desire more which sounds disturbing, but there's something about that that means those people don't live unfulfilled lives which is so much different from modern life, where most of us are potential alphas and betas, but there's only a few of those jobs to go around, so the rest of us get shunted into gamma and delta jobs unfulfilled lives broken dreams shattered self-worth and the people in the alpha and beta jobs look down on us as such i grew up in a two-bedroom, tiny little house with two parents and three younger sisters my sisters and i all shared a tiny room, so basically i had a bed and no private space we all dealt, but for some reason my second-youngest sister has always been extremely aggressive and nasty and my parents have always acquiesced to her demands and failed to discipline her, so our lives were absolute hell i loved school because i wasn't at home i always did well in school but i wasn't allowed to participate in any activities because it would have required either a) my parents to come pick me up once in a while, or b) me to walk home (half a mile) and even in high school, i wasn't allowed because it wasn't ""safe "" in suburbia wtf so when it came time to apply to colleges, i had no way to compete with my peers i had grades, but so did other people who also had lots of impressive things on their resumes in addition, i had no guidance on applying for colleges, and my parents told me not even to apply for any challenging schools because we could never pay for it anyway so i settled for a state school and i shouldn't complain about that, but feeling my squandered potential and wondering what if is something i will struggle with every day for the rest of my life i feel like i was lied to and i missed my chance now that i'm married, my family just wants to know when we're having kids i don't want kids my husband's mom is always ""making sure"" we go to church we lie because we don't i'm now an avowed atheist and in fact that change probably helped me gain a few extra months out of my life i could never tell any of my family this i'm very liberal; my republican family with a few straight-up racists eats me alive anytime anything slightly political comes off in conversation in short, any thing about me that is actually ""me"" is not desired or wanted by anyone that is in my life i live a lie to survive my parents should have gotten a divorce my mom is clearly unhappy with how life didn't work out my dad lied to her about what they were going to accomplish in life; she stayed home and raised us; he went to work he is lazy and has only ever done the bare minimum he got a promotion a year or two ago, after over 20 years of work, and after a couple of months he gave it up and went back to work because it was too hard he stays at home and watches tv all day he has never helped my mom he is mean and neglectful to her he doesn't/didn't help raise my sisters who are still at home, he doesn't help clean or fix up the house (which is in bad shape right now) my one sister is a complete bitch (told my mom on a crowded street one time that she's worthless and that's why dad doesn't love her; i wasn't there or i would have punched her in the head), and is completely nasty to everyone, yet she runs the house so even though i don't even live at home anymore, there is all this stress because my parents have never been able to manage the little bit of money they have they are crazy in debt and justify things like paying for evil sister's birth control and bus passes because she spends all her money on corsets, eating out, and weed not an exaggeration so i have all these issues from my past i'm dealing with; self-worth, a bit of neglect, the feeling that i always need to change myself and my behaviors to accommodate others i should always bend for others if there's ever friction between me and another person, it is my fault, always my wardrobe for work is falling apart my clothes are so old and worn out and i can't afford to replace them i am gaining weight too, and i don't even care, i eat poorly probably as a result of all this (i lost 40 pounds in school but have gained 40 back in the last two years) but what's the point, so i'm now a fat slob wearing worn out clothes to work i wear the same 5 shirts and 3 pants every week my shoes are worn out i work as staff at a very affluent private college and it is embarrassing to go to work i live so that i can go to work so i can afford to sleep under a roof, and the only reason i need a roof to sleep under is so i can continue to get up and go to work there is nothing more to my life, no further meaning it's not going to get better; i've been telling myself this for years things are steadily getting worse, and my options are gone this is going to be my life until i die, and i can't take it so the only thing i can control is how long i'll be doing this - when my release from it all will be i met my husband in college we had a pretty good relationship, maybe a little dull, but the only thing we ever really struggled with was communication we spent a lot of time working on it, assuming it would eventually get better that was four years of that we've now been married three years (4 years dating, 3 years marriage) and we're struggling still if you can call it struggling; i've officially quit i think i've been actually depressed since middle-school; i'm 26 now i had a brief glimmer of hope my first two years of college, but then the inevitability of marrying my husband became clear (everyone expected it so it was hard to say no, and when i tried to break up a few times, he acted so damn devastated and i was guilted into taking him back), and so i started to sink again i've never been formally diagnosed, but honestly, if this is the good life, life isn't worth living i'm going to continue this in the first post because apparently i've written too much :(",23,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e3ls3/nothing_really_to_say_no_options_no_point_not/,1289329249

e5pba,depression,tphonee,this is me: unlucky,"i'm a 22 year old 5th year undergrad struggling with life-long major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, though i've only been diagnosed for about 4 years i'm on my fifth antidepressant medication and second anti-anxiety medication, i take sleeping pills every night, and i pretty much contemplate suicide every waking moment i assume the mental health issues stem from my family life/childhood: my alcoholic father is verbally abusive and although has never once physically abused me, i've grown up with a severely fractured personal foundation, hence why i refer to my problems as life-long i started contemplating suicide at 12 but i somehow powered through it because i thought it was normal to feel like i did and i didn't want to be the girl that pussied out because i couldn't handle the pre-teen/teen angst everyone else was going through (or so i thought) i became a class clown, performed in theater, made excellent grades, and worked late hours as hard as i could because time at work meant more time away from home all of my supervisors and adult friends seemed to love me because i'm such a hard-worker, and i'm fairly certain that's what stemmed all the ill-feelings from my peers even now, as much as i love my program at school, i'm so intimidated by my peers and feel so ostracized that i don't go to class, but i still go to work, where i get that much needed gratification i used to seek help from my professors and mentors and bosses, i used to confide in them, until i realized it garnished more hatred and cruel intentions from my peers so, i've tried to make it on my own i'm a poor college student, who might as well be orphaned following my father's kicking me out for petty ""offenses"", so i tried my luck at the counseling and psychiatric services (caps) at my campus's health center it went well for about 6 months: i received psychiatric care, and was given medication, and also saw a psychologist, for free through a grant funded by parents and families of mental health patients after six months, they tried to refer me out to the community, which is understandable, and probably more welcome if i had been informed of this before i started attending caps so, after establishing a close relationship with my therapist and psychiatrist, i was being rejected from the program because i was recognized as a patient that needed ""long term care"", which caps was not suited to provide i stopped seeing anyone for a while until the insane depression, suicidal thoughts, severe irritability and apathy came back i started at a local sliding-scale clinic, and due to my income, i was again able to reap these services for free being a low-income focused clinic, the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick frequented there, most of them uneducated and battling with substance abuse along with mental health issues being white and above average in attractiveness, i felt compelled to dress in baggier clothing and hide my face so as to avoid harassment from the fellow clients at this clinic the clinic also isn't well-funded, so the care i receive is pretty sub-standard, but i still get my medication and psychological therapy until after another six months or so, i was told i would be assigned to a new therapist because my current one had finished her rotation i'm not sure if i'm the only one with this problem, but i have severe trust issues, especially with therapists, and once i develop a good relationship with one, i get extremely insecure about my ""old"" therapist and my ""new"" therapist trading notes, talking about me, then being expected to pick up where i left off with a stranger i then stopped seeing a therapist there my financial situation got a little better, so i started seeing a new therapist, but continued to receive medicinal help at the low-income clinic $50/week for my new therapist forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, but i enjoyed seeing him and felt like it had to be helping; the money i spent said it had to job changes and/or school changes put me in a position where i was unable to see my therapist, and i spiraled into a very low, severe depression i went to caps after-hours emergency care, and saw the supervisor of the program he asked all the right questions (""are you suicidal?""; do you have a plan?""; etc ) but never gave me a response to any of what i thought were my desperate please for help (""yes, i'm suicidal""; ""i'd drive my car into incoming traffic""; etc ) he photocopies pages of the phonebook under ""psychology"", told me to pick one and call them tomorrow so that i could seek extended psychological care, and sent me on my way i drove there i had just explained to him that i was suicidal and that my suicide plan involved my car, and he just sent me home i was so absolutely flabbergasted, i drove home (although i don't remember the drive), and once i settled back into my severe depression, i had a friend take me to the er, where i was checked into a crisis center for a week it was through the same low-income clinic i sought psychiatric care from, and the care was comparable i received a $3000 bill later for only the er visit, and was sent to collections for the $700 ""doctor's exam"" of it because, of course, they're billed separately to summarize the last year: my best friend of ten years completely wrote me out of his life after a few four-month or so hiatuses when he ""couldn't listen to my problems"" absolutely broke my heart, which is another flaw of mine, i suppose: i put absolutely everything i have into every relationship because i cherish those who find me worthy of friendship, a relationship, whatever that's all i have to be grateful for, really my landlord stiffed me on $500 worth of deposits, allowed new tenants to move into the house i was living in before my lease was up, and after filing a small claims suit, it comes back to me, undelivered, because the address he had written in my lease was bogus i have no way of finding him, and the immature little prick that he is won't answer my phone calls or address me in a professional manner my mentor, guardian angel, and wonderful soul that let me move into her home after my father kicked me out of his (my mother was against that decision), and taught me how a human being should be treated, passed away in february i miss her so, so, so incredibly much, and it's so difficult to find solace in my nonexistent or non-relatable clutch of friends i made a failed suicide attempt in august i don't think i should expand on this i wish i could delve more into my unluckiness, but i'm afraid no one wants to read it and i'm already depressed thinking about my life and just want to reach out for help i can't afford therapy anymore i don't have friends that even remotely understand what depression is i absolutely hate my life and am struggling to figure out what is it i'm here for it seems i've destroyed two relationships last night, though unintentionally, and i've found myself at the bottom of the barrel because of it i'm extremely ill, i can't eat for fear of throwing up because i'm so distressed;

e6639,depression,blackhole82,so i guess it's finally time i told my story,"let me start off my saying that i have just recently subscribed to this subreddit, if that's what you call this sort of thing i'm a relative newcomer to reddit and am not completely familiar with all the jargon yet if you spend a decent amount of time here you may have seen a few of my comments, or you may not (probably the latter) i'm a 28 year old shy male only child to be perfectly honest there probably shouldn't be any reason for me to be depressed my life relatively speaking could be considered not so bad, and i'm sure there are others that are a lot more worse off than me i have a decent job as a civil servant and make an ok salary working as a computer programmer but i don't consider myself that good at what i do i know enough to get by where i am, so i guess that's good enough i have my own house and vehicle (no car payment), and my own dog with a few positive changes things could be alright for me now this is where the depressing stuff starts i will probably need to include a tldr somewhere near the bottom i have always felt like an outsider it has been this way for about as long as i can remember even as a young child i can still remember a specific moment as myself on the outside of the group looking in i've always found it extremely hard to make friends and socialize with other people this probably comes from being an only child i feel like this factor along with not having a close knit family has been the catalyst for what i am today in a way it seems like i'm blaming my parents, which i really don't want to do my parents got divorced when i was 8 years old i know most of the blame rests firmly on myself for the decisions i've made it just seems like it didn't have to be this hard we all need our own support system to get by because life certainly isn't easy this seems to be notably absent in my life as of right now i count myself having zero friends that's right absolutely none no girlfriend nothing of course i get along well enough with the guys at work, but most of them have families/kids/wifes/lives etc we don't really do anything outside of work sad note: since living in my new house for over year, only one person has been over that i know and used to consider a friend i never seem to go anywhere any more it would be nice to be able to go to a friend's house or something anything really sometimes i feel like i just have to get out or i will go crazy, but there just doesn't seem to be any where to go :/ so i probably just end up sitting here browsing the net killing time till the next fruitless day reddit's really good for that my life consists of going to work during the week for 8 hours coming home maybe play some video games, eat, browse reddit, walk my dog and then sleep during the weekend it's pretty much the same i don't really even get any enjoyment out of video games any more either the weekend holds no special meaning for me and is actually even more depressing than the regular week since i know other people are out having fun i've gotten really good at just kind of sitting and staring into space i should probably include that in my okcupid profile or maybe not sometimes i just sleep to pass the time you can't feel depressed when you're asleep, but then eventually i wake up and it starts all over again i've probably been depressed my whole life, but only majorly so for the past 3 years i've been to a counselor which didn't really help it actually made me more depressed going and we eventually parted ways since she didn't think it was helping me i haven't been on antidepressants either, since i tried one and the side effects were a major bitch much noticeably the nausea which is already a big enough deal to me without even taking the medication i've always had sort of a queasy stomach i was diagnosed with acid reflux a long time ago, but i don't think that's quite accurate i'm not sure exactly what's wrong with me a lot of it is probably nerves/anxiety about all the bullshit in my life but maybe there is something that could help me who knows i hate medication and try to avoit it you can see it's been doing me a lot of good so i've avoided counseling/therapy, medication, and philanthropy; these seem to be the 3 main things people suggest to get out of depression i can't really find anything good i want to do for other people i tried looking a while back, but my indecision eventually got the better of me for a long time i've been caught up with the idea of having a girlfriend and actually had a couple but they just didn't seem to be the ""one"" my anxiety usually kills most of the chances i have to strike up conversation with anyone new i stopped trying long ago, when my inability to act made me feel physically and mentally like complete shit there have been a few people in my life which i thought that i really connected with but for some reason or other things just weren't meant to be one of them i tried to remain friends with, switching back and forth from trying to be friends with to pushing away i will say boyfriends were the root cause of failure in two cases in the past year i've pushed two people away when i just couldn't take it any more they just didn't seem to be good friends then others just leave of their own accord i don't really believe in having friends that you don't regularly see or talk to and/or do things with that just seems fucking pointless to me i'm not one for building up the huge ass list of facebook friends i've tried the online dating thing in the past with limited success, but now that is just another thing that doesn't seem possible for me i feel like some kind of post traumatic stress disorder veteran now when it comes to things like that i'm shell shocked and can't even begin to type a message or revise my profiles i can't type messages with the idea nagging in mind at every word that what i type will be something to ultimately lead to failure you see i've tried so many times in the past and now all the things that don't work seem to leave nothing left it just makes me sad now to even browse other profiles there seem to be genuinely wonderful people out there that i think i would get along great with up until i never hear anything back from them and am ignored forever so now like everything else i don't even try i like to believe that the world and people are genuinely good, but i continue to be proven otherwise back when i was in my early college days i had a much easier time at just writing whatever the fuck i wanted in my profile and messages because back then i wasn't as ""scarred"" as i am now the world of online dating was a clean slate as far as i was concerned back then i could be that cool guitar playing guy that didn't about anything (words purposely left out) so i was able to meet a few people and maybe just chat online but at least it was something and got me by well i feel like i've typed enough for now at least something to get me started plus i need to go walk my dog i may type some more when i get back tldr;

my friend pat decided to go grab some drinks from upstairs, so she ran off to get those while i stayed downstairs with her dad, we made small talk and joked a little before he started complimenting me on my body telling me i ""grew up beautifully"" while caressing my inner thighs lightly running his fingers over my 'no mans land' i was needless to say extremely creeped out, but panicked and wasn't sure exactly what to do, so i got up told my friend i was sick and walked out i never had a good relationship with either of my parents so i just tried really hard to repress the memory but i found it only made things worse for me, i began having trouble sleeping and when i did sleep i started having vivid nightmares about what had happened i became depressed and angry at the world i stopped going to classes because i just felt like it was pointless i hated everything i was learning because i felt like it wasn't going to help me i started hiding in the girls bathroom because i had nowhere to go during school hours after maybe a week or so of this i was found by a teacher an taken to my counselor he began asking me why i wasn't going to class to which i responded with ""i hate this stupid place "" constantly fiddling with my fingers and looking down it was true too i hated that place with such passion he didn't think much of it at the time and told me what i had to do to avoid expulsion it made me angry but i ended up going back to my classes and doing my work but without the motivation or drive to do things it was somewhat pointless for me to even try i was only good at english because i liked writing poetry, it was my way of venting my way of secretly writing about everything i was feeling when i turned 16 i met a guy at a metal show at a local venue in my town we'll call him ryan he was 25 at the time, before him i was never really interested in anyone and kept to myself a lot ( i barely had any girl friends, let alone boy friends) ryan was different and i learned that more and more as we became closer and hung out more he had so many similarities to myself and i was sure he would understand what i was going through, but before i had the chance to tell him about what had happened to me in the past he sent me an email saying that he should have never gotten involved with me and told me i was a mistake needless to say i was shattered i thought i had finally found someone to expressed my pain to and possibly get some help but just because he was gone didn't mean the mutual friends we made together were as well i knew a lot of bad people at this point in my life lots of drug dealers and a few dudes in gangs, these were the people who introduced me to cocaine they said that it would make all the pain i felt go away being stupid and desperate i began snorting, the rush i was getting was like nothing i had ever felt before i started to figure ""eh whatever no ones gonna care if i live or die"" so i continued snorting cocaine for about a year, but after i decided it was finally time to lay off the coke, i began to feel something i can't describe it in any other word but dead emotionally dead i couldn't feel anything and it scared the hell out of me i wasn't sure what was happening but i knew i wanted to feel something again i waited a few weeks hoping that this painful nothingness would pass while trying to deal with all the negativity going on in my life nothing happened if anything i felt worse about my life so i began take copious amounts of over the counter drugs hoping to od and end all the numbness i still remember walking to my counselors office all fucked up after taking 19 or so extra strength benadryll and pretty much told him what was going on thats when they finally got me some help some half ass'd help but help none the less in the form of a suicide watch counselor that my school paid for for me i began seeing my new counselor every week for an hour talking about myself but not really getting any advice about what i should do to get better instead my counselor thought it would be best to call my mother and tell her i was pretty much just crazy i get home from school and both my mom and dad are there, they sit me down in our parlor and tell me how disappointed they are that i'm putting them through this no words of comfort, no ""we'll get you any kind of help you need"" they sat me there and said ""why are you putting us through this? we're so disappointed in you"" as if this was my fault like i asked to be put through this self agony everyday i didn't know what to say so i just got up and went to my room hearing their words only made me feel worse and more empty and numb inside, and at this point all i wanted was pain, so i began abusing myself with one of my old baseball bats along with continuing my over the counter drug binging(just not as often nor as much) i beat the hell out of myself to feel alive then i would take benadryll to fall asleep and feel nothing my endless loop i did this until i was about 18 i managed to graduate high school after i decided that maybe if i finish and impress my parents everything would get better, but at this point my family was so distant from each other it went unnoticed, in fact they didn't even come to my graduation ceremony, just picked me up afterwards after high school was when i started dating my first serious boyfriend a 19 year old we'll call roach the first few months of our relationship were great i felt truly happy like i had everything i needed but i guess i should have known better 6 months into our relationship i found he was cheating on me with 6 different girls when i found out i was in such shock and i tried really hard to convince myself it wasn't true but the evidence i was presented said otherwise i stayed anyway for another 4 months before i realized that staying was making me seem like a psycho girlfriend because i never trusted a word he said and all his friends honestly thought i was just nuts i ended it with him and began getting harassed by his family and friends because of what he did to me they began calling me names like a slut, a whore, nigger, skank, you know all those things people will say to you to try and break your spirit i tried to not let it bother me and for awhile it was working but the more time went on the more i slowly convinced myself that i had ruined my relationship and that it was my fault he started cheating after all that i found i hated being alone and had to think of what i can do to fix this new void in my chest, i became very promiscuous and would meet guys in various ways to feel something emotionally i didn't care about anything, i just wanted that pleasure of feeling desired again after a few months of doing this and living on my own after being told by my mother i'm not welcome at home anymore i was running out of money and needed to pay rent i'm sure you all know where this is going i began selling my body while actively looking for a job so i could pay my rent and my bills at first i thought i could do it because the money was pretty decent and i could pay for my rent and everything else and still have enough left over to by myself a little something but the more men i met the harder it became considering that most of the men i met were aged from between 35 and 55 i'm out of this business now and am happy to be free but because of it i have developed a severe case of ptsd and what i'm told is mania i can no longer look people directly in the eye for more then a second without feeling like they're laughing at me or know about what i've been going through in the past it's killing me inside and i have been having suicidal thoughts again, my mind tells me its time to give up and let go of life i'll spend days on my own debating whether or not today will be the day i end it all i know mentally i need help putting the pieces of my life back together but the depression i've been dealing with is preventing me from seeking it something inside me just tells me i'd be better off dead i'm probably missing a ton of details, and frankly i don't even know if it all makes sense i just wrote it as i remember it, so please any advice would be great help me reddit you're my only hope",27,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6m1b/i_think_i_need_some_more_help_assessing_my_mental/,1289859328

ebhlt,depression,localover,am i depending to much on my relationship to cope with my depression/anxiety issues?,"throwaway, so is a reddit user i've had depression and gad (generalized anxiety disorder) issues since jr highschool which have gotten progressively more severe in the past 5 years or so, given some highs and some lows i'm about to turn 25 i can definitely say there have been some experiences in the past few years that have contributed to my issues (rejection from some one i thought was ""the one"", substance abuse, failing certain goals i had for school and where i wanted to be in life etc ), but probably one of the best things that has happened to me was getting together with my boyfriend almost 3 years ago in our ""honeymoon"" stage, i can honestly say that was the happiest i've ever been that i can remember, aside from early childhood maybe, love definitely is a drug though the new exciting ""honeymoon"" stage may be over, my feelings for him have only gotten stronger, he really is the one thing that makes me happy we spend time together everyday, if not all day together, we even recently began working with each other we get along great, and do everything together, we're best friends being around him makes me happy, we make each other laugh, i feel safe and i don't concentrate on the bad thoughts in my head as much here is where my concern comes in, while our relationship has grown progressively over the past few years, my issues with gad and depression have gotten severely worse due to other circumstances in my life that were initially unrelated to our relationship i'm beginning to notice that i often feel anxious when i'm not with him, or as cheesy as this sounds, incomplete, but almost in an unhealthy way i have never been a clingy person, and in past relationships i've always been the one to want my own time and space, and have historically been more content being alone always considered my self to be pretty independent, especially in a tomboy sort of way, ""don't need a man for anything"" mentality now i just want to be with him all the time, and i've even gotten appalled at myself when i've realized i've felt the need for him to accompany me or assist me with things which in the past i would have easily accomplished by myself i'm also concerned because we both come from the same circle of close friends which we have isolated ourselves from, we used to hang out with friends every week, now we seldom do, we usually just stay in i've never wanted to be one of those couples, and i've never wanted to be some one who loses their identity in their relationship but sometimes i feel like i am everything about our relationship is perfect except for the fact that i think i depend on it to much for my happiness, i think i've let the relationship take up too much of my life i guess, i don't see friends as much and don't do certain hobbies that made me happy, like painting, because he makes me happy so i give all that energy to the relationship now i get anxiety and get depressed when i think about the neglect in other areas of my life due to my focus on my relationship so my source of happiness and escape (my relationship) is now contributing to the things i'm trying to escape from i guess i need balance for this growing vicious cycle any suggestions or advice reddit?",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ebhlt/am_i_depending_to_much_on_my_relationship_to_cope/,1290661905

his parents are useless his friends have mostly moved on because they paid attention in college, otherwise all he has left are the kinds of fuck-ups falling out into rehab he doesn't have anyone left but me and he doesn't seem to want my help but i'm the only one, i think, who can help him all he does now is stay in his room all day, get high and avoid human contact he's convinced there is no point to his life because he's worthless and cannot get a degree he's accumulating a ton of debt by staying in these courses he has no intention of trying to pass, which depresses him more i feel when i try to suggest jobs and such, he seems to think everything is beneath him and he would rather kill himself than take any of the numerous jobs i've had through the years (my parents have made me work, and work hard, since 15 his parents have never attempted to set any boundaries or parent him even once thus he has zero work ethic and thinks jobs like retail positions are degrading or something, which of course makes me feel bad when considered how many of those positions i've had even though i'm a college graduate ) so i know it's a fucked-up, and this is a story that takes six years to tell, but i'm scared to death that i'm the only one left to help and no one else can or will i love my friend, i really do, but on the same hand i realize i shouldn't or shouldn't get involved because he doesn't really seem to care about me or check up on me or anything of that nature and i'm just setting myself up for failure by staying close to him i actually tried to ""break up"" a few weeks ago and stay friendly but cut off all possible contact, but that didn't take because in being friendly and asking how things were, i stumbled upon this whole short-of-suicide mess how do i help him? i have no idea anymore i spend too much of my time worrying about it, too i was in tears when he was hinting at suicide, and it kills me to know he's all alone and avoiding everyone else what should i do?

**excercise** - if you don't wanna lift weights or get into bodybuilding you can try to do some cardio or jogging or whatever just try to be physically active your mind has to focus at least partially on your body when you're active, and that means less time to focus on negative thoughts **balanced diet** - my diet really sucked for years on end because i was a clueless student who used to get every meal made by my mother these days i eat a big breakfast and usually 5 meals a day with a balanced intake of protein, carbs and fats if you have no clue about nutrition, there are tons of forums out there dedicated to it i wouldn't be surprised if there's a subreddit about it too **socialize** - avoiding people made me crazier than i had to be at the end of the day, humans are social creatures and additionally, if you are a self hater like me, you really don't enjoy your own company",2,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/edn2s/my_way_out/,1291080111

nothing i get to be just like everyone else, still searching for a reason to be happy into my old age why deal with depression your whole life? at what point do you say enough is enough? i'm half of a person depression has stolen my life from me i'm taking responsibility for my own actions - it's nobody's fault other than mine that i developed depression and i'm now suffering i know that depression isn't just some magical force that controls my life, and that my actions contribute the most to my life but even then, i still feel like the depression has stolen something from me it has, really it's taken away the hope of a better tomorrow it's taken away all of my dreams, it's taken my willpower, my self worth, everything i feel nothing i'm an empty shell i can physically feel the emptiness my stomach does not exist, my heart is not there i'm just a bunch of meat and bone and nothing more than that i'm in a relationship and i don't even know why i have no ability to feel i see him, i love him but i feel dead i can't feel any love from him i want to feel it, but i don't have the capacity i crave more love, more affection i want someone to told me and tell me i'm beautiful and that it will all be okay but i can't get what i crave why even be with someone like me? what's the point? of course you don't want to be affectionate with the person who is unresponsive but my god, it doesn't mean to stop trying i feel like i am begging and pleading, and i am being laughed at i might feel better if he was more loving at least for a little while i'm so lonely i can barely breathe i feel like i am a toy, like i am just something to fuck with and laugh it i feel like he is standing on a rescue boat, watching me sink watching me drown, and he is laughing throw me a line do anything i need you more than you will ever know to him, i'm just some bitch to fuck when she's happy if she's not happy, then screw that i'm worth it to play house with, but not worth it to marry i'm worth it to toy with, to lie to ""maybe we will marry"", ""but i have been saying no for years"", ""probably before you're 30"", ""never, accept it "" people love to fuck with me, to see my squirm even my own boyfriend would rather toy than me instead of being an actual caring human being i'm worthy of a half-hearted ""i love you"", and not worth any real expression of emotion and support i need real support, and i am coming up short i know, he would be if i was more receptive but for fuck's sake, i am depressed, what is not understood about that?! there is only so much i can do i want to make it better, i really do, so much but i just can't i want him to understand i need him to try because i have no way to keep my head above water clearly, i'm just an idiot i mean, it's true, i'm a loser i have a boyfriend of nearly 4 years who won't do anything to even humor me i'm sitting, spilling my heart to the damn internet, hoping someone will really hear my words and will understand, and possibly throw me that line i so desperately need i am uttlerly alone there are billions of people, but i'm still alone i feel like i am screaming for help and people are looking right through me i'm like the invisible bitch no one should care about these feelings i have never go away when i wake up, when i shower, when i make a sandwich, when i drive my car, when i go to school, when i watch tv, when i fall asleep these feelings haunt me i don't get to truly rest, and i don't know true happiness thanks for reading my wall of text, and i hope you know it is grealy appreciated it's nice to know that someone, somewhere out there, will read my post and will understand i know this text was the overemotional writing of a depressed person, and these are just my feelings i guess, maybe, that reality is much different tl;dr: i need a hug, please",6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/edyrx/im_on_a_sinking_boat_and_its_name_is_depression/,1291135015

(he wrote down ""depression"" in my chart ) or is it common for those diagnosed as bipolar to have never been manic? i'm sure i've had bouts of hypomania but definitely have never been manic (with psychotic breaks like my brother had) i've also never even contemplated suicide or been close to that point on the depression side does this sound like cyclothymia? anyway, i'll be seeing him again in 3 weeks and my therapist weekly until then, but was just curious in the meantime thanks in advance!",19,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ee33q/depressiononly_side_of_bipolar/,1291149190

i go to probably the most stunning highschools for miles around, with amazing teachers you can’t find anywhere else my friends are great, at least i think they are, they always are nice and considerate, that’s not to say we don’t goof around and make fun of eachother, but they are amazing friends i have a great family, who very rarely fight, we all truly love each other, i am blessed we are very well off, i have never heard any talks of money trouble, in fact i’m typing this on my personal 2300 dollar macbook i should be grateful, and i am but no matter how many times i count my blessings, i continue to feel depressed i don’t know if my mind is pretending to be depressed because i want to be a part of things that i;m not and i use it as a crutch or maybe i am depressed, but i can’t think of any reason as to why or howi could be depressed, how is it that in the media everyone with depression is depicted as having a reason, bully, abusive family, poverty, or life trauma i have never had to deal with any of this and yet im miserable i try to change my lifestyle because i keep thinking that maybe that will kickstart my motivation to do well anything i feel no desire anymore to go hang out with friends, not like i truly ever have though, i spend my time watching tv and messing around on the computer, doing absolutely nothing part of the reason im depressed is i know i should be happy but i can’t seem to make myself be happy at all i have depression but hey who’s gonna listen, everyone will i’m surrounded by those who love me, and im sure that anyone of them would take time out of their day to listen and help, but what do i tell them exactly im depressed, but i cant tell you why youre probably thinking why my family and friends haven’t noticed my depression, well i don’t let my grade slip mostly because i want to please those that have given me so much, but i truly have no motivation at all anymore and if you looked closely at my grades you could tell that in fact that non motivation is actually showing i find myself wondering that if i killed myself would people notice or care, even if they did would it be genuine or would it be so as to not be a jerk, in my imagination, which i thought i could control it seems that only those that were really close to me cared as well as others who begin crying for the attention, even if they don’t themselves sometimes it’s not even me killing myself sometimes it’s just i died of heart attack or something maybe the reason i never thought i was depressed was because i thought i was sad that i wasn’t popular, but maybe i was depressed because i’m lonely, some of my closest friends have stopped hanging out with me and my other friends aren’t really more than eat lunch with, copy homework friends right now i probably have two close real friends and five others maybe im just sad that life is passing me by while i waste time alone watching tv i find myself pondering how much weight the ceiling lamp can hold, the height of my closet , the circumference of my head or what the principal would say on the announcements at school if i indeed went through with it, which i won’t seriously, but i get depressed each time i realize that im thinking these things because i know it will hurt my family if i did it, and sadly that’s the only reason i can think of but its enough to prevent me from even seriously considering it my family probably has no idea that i feel this, i act happy around them, but i rarely am truly happy i don’t enjoy lying but again i don’t what else to do sleep is my safe haven, it’s just me and my thoughts, nothing else i wish could sleep more, but since i feel no motivation to complete even the simplest of tasks i end up staying up late often, it may be leading to insomnia i don’t know, you see ive looked up symptoms of depression and i might have it but then i go onthinking that oh wait maybe im just thinking that because i read it here, or im misinterpreting to make myself fit the mold i apologize for this rant, i just am not sure what to do",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eg1i7/trying_to_figure_out_why_i_feel_depressed/,1291447684

eh699,depression,depressedthrowaway2,so damn sad and frustrated,"so, this is a throw away for reasons that will become obvious so almost a year and a half ago i started an ldr with a girl i met online big mistake, i know everyone will say some crap about how stupid this is, but, it was after we had been talking on the phone for awhile, i knew she was a girl, what she looked like, we video chatted, etcetera anyways, so basically i go to a boarding school, it's about 300 kids, i know most of them i am a 17 year old senior, as a notice but basically, it's not like i'd get a date here anyways, because hockey is basically a religion here and i don't like it and i'm the only ""nerd"" on campus, there are other people who are way better at math and science then i am, i'm fairly decent at reading and writing (this post aside but hey it's a semi/full-rant) i mean, everyone wants someone with similar interests, and in terms of interests, i'm kind of a jack of all nerds, not really amazing knowledgeable about any particular thing, but i know a lot about various things video games, comics, anime/manga, books, d&amp;d, writing stories/poetry, acting, all that jazz i mean, my best friend here is the closest thing to a nerd as well, and i mean, unless i'm using ""nerd"", incorrectly, i'm not anti-social i always try to ask people whats wrong, cheer people up when they are sad, help others, and try to make friends with as many people as possible and i'm not ugly either, not really hot either, just kind of average so i don't really know how i would attract someone, or be able to win someone's heart here, nor would it really work out as different interests anyways, so we've been dating awhile, recently though he hasn't called or talked as often (she just got into college) and has said she has been having a tough time and lots of work, so i try to be understanding, but she almost never calls, and even agrees with me that we don;t talk as much as we used to so now the other day she tells me she wants to (act as if we were just friends again) and talk about nerdy things as if we were friends, because she has ""lost the spark"" and isn't sure if she loves me any more, or why she did in the first place, now i still love her, but now i'm vibrating between two stances either a: ""i love you so much that i'll keep on loving you until you love me back"" then try to make it work or b: ""i love, and have for this past one and a half years, and now you all of a sudden don't love me? i still love you, but i'm not going to stay in a relationship with someone i love but who doesn't love me back"" then break-up (insert obligatory delete from facebook, get a lawyer, hit the gym) but that's not all in addition, my dad is still looking for a job after two years, my mom is going crazy and my brother is a dick, so i can't really rely/get support from my family except maybe my dad even still, no matter how hard i try at school, i never seem to be able to do well at anything, i have a 3 56, gpa or just about and yet it seems like no matter what i do, i'm never as good as anyone else, and maybe i shouldn't worry about that as this quarters grades won't be looked at until after i'm accepted or rejected to college, but whatever oh and on theater, our new director is really cool, he's new this year, and after working as stage manager past season (which was actual work, our director prides on trying to run our plays like professional ones) and so basically this season i'm a puppeteer of the main villain in the musical, and my best friend is the voice now i love my best friend to death, but i feel like when the play is over, i'll get no recognition of my effort for the play, as everyone will have heard his voice and he is more popular than i let me get this straight, i don't hold it against my friend, he is awesome, it's just, even thought i don't do acting for the attention, it is nice to feel like people did appreciate your effort and as stage manager showed me, only really the cast appreciated it, which was nice, but still oh, and in addition i keep trying to make friends online through various community sites, tvtropes, reddit, gaia but where-ever i go i almost always get shit on, or end up as the ""butt monkey"" or get, ""gtfo the internet, faggot"", responses and sure it's the internet, but i'd hope it's not the same everywhere other than being down about that stuff with my girlfriend, family, college application pressure, lack of people to talk about nerdy things with i'm really hoping i get come positive reinforcement, or some empathy comments but that probably won't be the case let's see, other than this, i feel all around skill-less and worthless, as it seems like no matter how much effort i put in, i get less, or very little out of things so yeah, i'm really depressed edit: i'm probably half/fully venting with this",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eh699/so_damn_sad_and_frustrated/,1291663383

always kinda been odd i guess in elementary school, i was called a goth by this kid who no one understood, in grade 6 he never called me a goth in a bad term, just more of a statement i remember two girls wanted to be his best friend, and he'd do whatever he could to ignore them i didn't really care or notice him much but everytime i was walking home and he saw me, he'd either wait or run up to keep walking with me he left the year he came, and that same year, i lost my best friend to a new girl in grade 7 i started becoming, more emotional i guess i just cried practically every day i don't know why but there was always a reason, be it something that happened at school, or when my parents yelled at me near the end of the year my class went to a university for a few days i really liked this one boy, let's call him jason jason was best friends with another guy in my class who i just couldn't stand because of how rude he is on the last day, we were going to go on a boat for a dance type thing we all got ready, and then some of us girls found out that jason's best friend, bet jason and another guy money to dance with one girl and myself the girl really liked the one boy, and i really liked jason but because that other boy bet them $10 each to fucking dance with us? and i know, a dance who cares but when you were in a class of 20, who all practically grew up together it was a big deal me and this girl got so upset my teacher came over to me and kept saying, it will be alright, karma is a bitch, and it will come it made me feel better, but every time i looked at jason on the boat i kept crying i had to sit on the top deck while everyone was downstairs inside because i couldn't stop crying sadly, i suck at staying mad at people, so i ended up forgiving jason a few weeks later by the time i was in grade 8, i was still emotional, crying a lot there was a group of about 5 people who loved to pick on me, my ex-best friend, her new best friend, that boy who bet jason, and two other boys one day during science they actually started throwing stuff into my hair i started bawling, and i had to run out of the room once ninth grade came, i already cut ties with practically every person from my old school except for about 4 or 5 people i found new friends, got more confidence and i wasn't as emotional by the end of the first semester i met a boy named keith keith was one of those people who just always made me smile he disappeared for a bit after a month of talking to him i checked his facebook, and he claimed he was attempting suicide he drank some sort of chemicals and ended up in the hospital i was so worried, because a few days before it all happened he got his phone taken away he texted me a week later saying, sorry some stuff was going on are you okay? i was so worried, and he never really told me what happened, just that he was really sorry and he had some family issues it pretty much went back to normal after a few weeks back then he used text me saying how much he liked me, or how much he wished we hung out more so many times i'd wake up with my cell phone sitting on my pillow beside me with 5 unread texts, all from him saying goodnight because he knew i fell asleep he used to always walk me home, and he was always too shy to ask me out in person for some reason though, i always said no after the first time i said yes because he got his friend to ask me out for him, his friend got him confused after i said yes, so we never did one day he was at camp with his family, and i was at my grandparents, he texted me saying how much he misses everyone, especially me his younger brother even took his phone when he fell asleep to tell me how much he liked me he meant so much to me one day he admitted he cut i was so upset and distraught he even showed me them after i kept asking but once he showed me, i couldn't look at him, i thought, ""how could someone do something so terrible to them self?"" by the end of july i was going to germany for a few weeks, i told him as a joke i was moving, but he believed me, for some reason i went moody and as a cruel joke kept it going, he was crying i felt terrible afterwards but i don't remember apologizing when i left, we still talked on msn, and he would stay up until 3am just to talk to me because of the time difference though a week or so before i came home, we had a huge fight it was 8 am for me, 2 am for him he stayed up until 2 am, to message me, saying how much of a clingy bitch i was he went away for a camp the week i came back, i was so glad because we still weren't talking i knew the date he came back, so i was calm three days before i thought he was coming back, he called me i guess i sounded harsh, our phone call was a total of 30 seconds i started crying so much once he hung up by october, keith and i completely stopped talking it was completely my fault though, but i wouldn't accept it and convinced so many others it was his fault he transferred to a different school that year, and found a girlfriend i met a guy online named luke though, i didn't mind as much luke was so nice and funny, he lived in a different province but would always text and call me i always believed every word he said but sadly he was suicidal and would always bring it up, it was heart wrenching one day i went on a school trip with two people, one friend and one boy from my elementary school the boy brought up our elementary days and i told him i hated them, he told me, my whole class thought i cut in grade 8 because i was always upset i lied and told them i do cut and started in grade 9 i automatically questioned myself why i would say that i guess it was keith, or maybe my friends from elementary who cut to be a 'rebel' i didn't cut, i didn't for a while well, until january i don't remember if it was a fight between my family and i, or luke i felt the blade, and i winced i didn't do it again for a while i started again, i don't remember why, but i ended up telling one of my friends at the time, david he made me promise him i wouldn't do it again i didn't i lasted 4 months, until he broke his pinky promise so i broke mine i only cut once or twice a month i didn't really think much of it by grade 10 though, i got in more fights with my parents, my mom and i fought over everything my dad always agreed with my mom, and my brother just wished i was dead i started feeling more alone no matter how many people surrounded me i started writing poems, mostly about depression, or whoever upset me that week i stopped suddenly once school ended by june, luke and i always fought, and i would go weeks ignoring him eventually i felt so bad, i started talking again, but saying it would never be the same i never really truly believed who he said he was i believed his age by his voice though by august he spilled to me he wasn't luke valentine, a 17year old he was jeremiah smith, a 16 year old i couldn't decide how to feel, that he cares enough to tell me who he is or to be raging at the fact i fell for someone who he made up i chose the second one, and went off at him by this point, i have started cutting so much more i just felt numb for a long time i once wrote a post about who i was on tumblr my friend saw it, and started crying she took me to guidance at my school the next day she made me tell guidance that i cut i lied i convinced them i stopped in may that's when i started cutting more that's when the guidance counsellor told me, i'd have to call my parents and tell them my friend was beside me, crying more than i was when the counsellor was on the phone, i blurted out to tell my dad i wasn't suicidal, because he thought i was before i have seen my mother cry multiple times i have never seen her cry so much in my lifetime my dad went away to paris that week it was just me, my mother and brother ever since then, i have been cutting so much more, just to feel something i know some people who squirm when i told them i cut so i keep telling them, because i know they don't care that i do i feel like i can't tell people who care because it makes me feel so much worse they care about me, and i don't i'm more of a bitch now, i've lost over 30 friends this year alone i always feel alone, no matter who i'm with, or how many friends i have i could be with 5 closest friends, and still feel alone i'm always depressed, and i can never seem to see anything in a positive light i have the words fuck up carved into my leg and the word fat on my stomach i have cuts running on every piece of skin i can cover at a hallowe'en party, i got really drunk, i told those i didn't want to know that i cut i told everyone i was sorry, but i just wanted to forget obviously, a drunken mind speaks a sober heart i told one of my friends one of the main reasons i cut because i hate how i look, because i find myself disgusting and fat she told me i wasn't either i laughed in her face now, i avoid my friends more and more maybe i just don't deserve them because i feel like i'll never believe people when they say i look nice, or i have a nice personality i'm just always tired now maybe one day i won't have to force a smile to seem like i'm alright i feel like i'm tearing apart i'm sorry if you just read this it's super long i know, but this is all in short form i just needed to write it

ei98b,depression,running_on_empty,back to 'normal',"normal for me is depression i don't remember the last time i wasn't truly depressed (not including my brief reprieve recently) must have been when i was a kid and didn't know any better i've posted here before more than once i've posted in the ama's about how i was going to go across the us to meet the girl i'd been talking to for over two years no one directly asked me but it didn't work out while on the ride back home she told me she didn't want to be in any relationship at the moment later she asked if we could still be best friends i thought i could deal with the whole situation at the time but the reality is coming back slowly no love lasts forever, and i'll probably be alone for the rest of my life i'd never thought about suicide before i met her i also never drank not that i drink a lot but one night i just got pushed over the edge and got myself drunk and now i think about suicide a lot not that i'd do it for some reason i have some kind of mental block against it i'd never do it and that's another depressing point- there's no way out for me i can't kill myself, i don't have enough money for food, let alone alcohol or drugs i have no friends i have no time to do anything but work i'm stuck in this existence no, i know what reddepression will say, and i don't want to talk to anyone my parents and i are as distant emotionally as strangers, and i never want to open up to them about any of this there's no one else to talk to i desire to talk to therapists even less than my parents, and i couldn't afford them anyway sometimes i feel i see a light, a little bit of happiness here or there it's maddening because i don't have the means to reach it happiness might be completing a new website, but i never reach it because i don't have the attention span or work ethic to finish i don't have the creativity and my intelligence is waning i realize all this and the light goes away and life sucks again i don't know depression is normal for me it used to be comforting because it was the thing i remembered but my trip showed me how to be happy for a few days i guess i never really knew what i was missing and i was okay with it now i know i did things on that trip that i want to do again but know i never will i know what i'm missing now and that just makes my life worse tl;dr - i lead a worthless, depressed life, understanding the happiness i miss out on the love of my life doesn't want a relationship with me, but wants to be friends i have no way out",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ei98b/back_to_normal/,1291812730

eif9j,depression,datingdepressive,"how to proceed with gf of ~8 mo who doesn't like herself, has social anxiety, and seems mildly depressed","thanks in advance for anyone willing to read this there's a **tl;dr** below i've posted to r/relationship_advice several times within the past two months under different accounts glad i found this subreddit because it might give me better insight into my girlfriend you see, i've been with her for about 8 months and things were actually pretty good at the beginning (but that's usually the case) i noticed early in that she wasn't too keen on doing too many social things i learned later that she is medicated for social anxiety (klonopin) she also has very low energy and thinks she might have ""mild"" depression, but seems afraid to admit it right out she has also mentioned several times that she has low self-esteem, actually saying she doesn't like herself i have to admit, dating her has been more of a challenge as compared to any other girl i've dated ""challenging"" not in the sense that she demands much of me, but challenging in the way that i feel like i am keeping us afloat i sometimes even feel like she withdraws and i can't help but think she's pushing me away so i don't know if how she's been should be construed as signals that she wants me to fuck off or if i'm being naïve by assuming she still actually likes me, and that the way she's been has more to do with what she's going through; and not me my main concern is that i want her to know i care about her without scaring her off and feeling that she has to feel pressured to ""perform "" right now (in the short term) it isn't such a big deal she doesn't like to go and do the things that i like to do even if i wish she could be with me at times when friends have their girlfriends around we even once almost broke-up because she kept insisting i wasn't happy and felt like she was trying to ""let me off the hook "" the thing is, it may be too early for me to know whether or not i love her, but i really do care about her as a person she's pretty emotionally closed-off and i'm closer to being an open book i've actually had to make a conscious effort to step on the figurative brakes so as to not overwhelm her i guess i really don't know how to approach this relationship i sometimes chalk up her lack of motivation for lack of interest, but even if that was the case, i wouldn't know whether it's more a symptom of her depression/anxiety or if she's truly disinterested when we're together, it sometimes feels like she wants me there (as affectionate as she can relatively be) then other times it's like she's aware of how she's coming off (and has even mentioned it) and seems to close herself off social anxiety coupled with mild depression and low self-esteem is nothing i've dealt with in a partner before how can i show her that i care without overwhelming her? i don't want to feel like i'm walking on eggshells around her for the fear of doing something ""wrong "" in regards to her low self-esteem, would anything i say or do to counter those feelings be counter-productive or ineffective? i definitely don't want to be the cheery, annoying person who constantly tells her she's ""worth something"" and ""wonderful"", etc however, i feel like i *show* her she matters to me, so should that be enough? also, i can't discern whether the way she acts is a reflection of her attitude towards me or if it's mainly because of the third-party causes i've mentioned i have zero experience with dating someone like this i look back at the first several months of our dating and she tried a bit harder but that may have been because of the honeymoon phase however, she's always had an aversion toward really going out and doing anything, especially around a big group and late at night (she has extremely low energy ) so most of the time we have together has been one-on-one, not doing anything short of watching tv, or playing board games, etc only a handful of times in the 8 months we've been together have we done anything with a group of other people this isn't a complaint, but just giving you some perspective i sometimes feel like i should just give her complete space and wait until she comes to me, but i've tried that; and i felt like she construed that as i was growing bored of her, confirming what *she* thought *i* thought about her (saying things like ""you think i'm a bad gf, right? you're not happy "") but i wonder if she was just projecting and perhaps she isn't happy because of me i really don't know i'm at a loss i really care about her but i don't know how to approach this we almost broke up once around the time i backed off a bit but we instead decided to keep things going at a casual pace, etc and she was open to that, especially when i mentioned that there'd be no pressure for her to ""perform""; just to be herself she liked the idea she was very affectionate that night, but i also hadn't seen her in a month because of that alone (how affectionate she was), i like to think i'm not fooling myself and that she really does like me, even if it's not to the extent (and consistentcy) that i wish she could show it i'm trying to stick it out with her as long as i can because i do care about her, but this is proving to be difficult since my face-to-face and communication/emotional needs are higher than hers, but right now, i'm just glad she's still with me but i'm not sure how to progress with her if i want to keep this thing afloat maybe i can be offered some insights or pointed to resources, old-posts, or any advice you can give me i know each case is unique but i'll take anything that might help me get an understanding of how she may be seeing the world, and how i can find that equilibrium between being supportive without overwhelming her thank you, reddit *i'm in the midst of studying for finals right now so my responses may be intermittent * thanks again **tl;dr** i've been with my girlfriend for ~8 months i've come to realize she suffers from social anxiety (medicated with klonopin), says she doesn't like herself (low self esteem) and seems to exhibit symptoms of depression i want to be a good boyfriend to her/supportive without saying/doing things that are counter-productive or overwhelming her with anything, but i also want to ensure she doesn't think i'm giving up either at times it felt like she would push me away and didn't know if this was actually because of me or things she's struggling with i want her to feel supported but i realize i have needs to i will try to stick this out as long as i can, but i just need advice on how to proceed with her considering the circumstances i have zero experience in this type of relationship in any capacity thank you",16,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eif9j/how_to_proceed_with_gf_of_8_mo_who_doesnt_like/,1291833360
eii71,depression,endlessfloptimism,feeling very sad and helpless,"over the last few months i have started to feel worse and worse i figured it was stress from work, but i'd always handled stress okay and i was not handling this so well i've been increasingly fatigued and irritable constant headaches this is exacerbated by the fact that fewer and fewer of my friends, both high school and college friends, seem inclined to talk to me or include me in activities they are almost all engaged or married, so maybe it's that they can't relate to me anymore the college friends (graduated in 07) all live fairly far away and typically the only time i see them is when i drive up to them the day before thanksgiving, though, they made plans to hang out 15 minutes from my house and didn't invite me until 3 hours before i felt like a total afterthought i'm kind of seeing someone, but he lives an hour away and i don't get the impression that he cares very much he flakes on me a lot and hardly ever has a kind word for me when i'm in a romantic relationship, i frequently go out of my way to do nice things and be considerate of the other person i'm up front with my feelings and make my expectations clear (of which there are few) i listen and will do anything to help if they need it i keep thinking i should just get over it because not everyone is going to do things how i do i used to exercise almost every day, taking classes at the gym or jogging or yoga now the thought of exercising makes me exhausted a woman humiliated me in front of a full spin class by loudly demanding i get off of her bike 10 minutes into the class i was so embarrassed i haven't been able to go back yoga is so crowded lately it stresses me out to be in there and jogging may be out because i have knee and ankle troubles i can tell i have gained a couple pounds from not being as active which makes me feel so ashamed of my laziness yesterday my dr told me she thinks i'm depressed and prescribed an antidepressant it's good to have an explanation i suppose but at the same time i wonder if she's wrong and i'm just a whiny idiot i'm so sorry, i don't even know why i'm posting this none of these seem like real problems i know there are people going through much worse i guess i was hoping to get some outside perspectives because i feel like i'm going crazy inside my own head i don't want to burden people so i keep a lot to myself there has to be something i can do that makes it easier to get up in the morning or that makes me not be on the verge of tears all the time",7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eii71/feeling_very_sad_and_helpless/,1291841751

(i assume there is, but my counselors in the past were never willing to advise me on that) 2) is there a way to know for sure my insurance company will cover me to see someone and not wind up sticking me with a huge bill later? 3) if the answer to 2 is 'no', then are there any real psychotherapists that work on a sliding scale like these bullshit counseling services?",9,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eijnp/i_am_the_real_forever_alone_and_i_wonder_how_much/,1291846505

ejigs,depression,[deleted],why does sadness feel so good?,"it's like some kind of cathartic release sometimes, sitting here weeping there's beauty in it, almost like a negative euphoria; it feels just as true and right as happiness but when you're happy, you look back on the sad times as 'pathetic'; forgetting they're just as real, just as poignant i almost crave the feeling of sadness as a release; it really is quite curious, for a 19-year old it's occurred to me that i like being happy but hate the chase, the obsession for happiness i hate the desires, the needs, the desires, the whole lot it creates fake friendships, the false idea that you are getting somewhere in life, that you as an individual are important or significant in any way, the goal orientation, the ridiculous idea of 'success', whatever the hell that even means but most of all i hate the taboo the likes of 'don't worry, be happy' happiness has replaced any religious god as our master and we are slaves to it what we want, really, is satisfaction to kick back and say 'that was okay after all'; the good times and the bad are both included in that and to feel that way, i need to throw any notions of happiness out of the window, to just accept my feelings as what they are as all necessary parts to a whole and sure, if i'm sad all my life, i'm performing a duty which is necessary for someone else to be 'happy' they can look over at me, see my sadness, and think 'boy, i'm glad i'm not him!' (of course, it'd be far more respectful for that person to say 'i have utmost respect for your sadness, for you allow me to feel happiness') - indeed, their happiness *depends* on me being sad, and my sadness requires me to look at other 'happy' people and say 'wow, those lot are having a good time, why aren't i?' and so i no longer see depression as a negative thing but rather a way of life which comes and goes i relish in it it's the depression that 'too, will pass'",11,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejigs/why_does_sadness_feel_so_good/,1291985349

ejtxm,depression,[deleted],in a situation where i am very stuck and hate it,"hey guys, this is my first introspective post i've ever made on a public forum, so i apologize in advance if it ends up being ranty, random, nonsensical or simply indiscernible i'm a fairly content fellow when i'm out and about, i'm all smiles when i'm with friends, i'm always laughing and always telling jokes when i'm at home, i hide away in my room, think dark thoughts and simply want to get out as an aside, i'd like to say that ""get out"" does *not* imply suicide - i have had friends commit suicide and, truly, i don't want to do that to those around me it's selfish and causes so much pain i suppose i'll get into some backstory as to why i'm feeling stuck (in my current situation) it all started about 2 5 years ago i was in a relationship with this girl, and had been for almost 3 years we were a healthy couple despite me going to school in a different city i was finally home for that summer and got to spend more time with her that's when i found out she cheated on me the tl;dr of that story is: she cheated on me with the australian man who took advantage of her when she was 13 years old that crushed me i had nothing but trust and faith in that relationship, and that simple action brought it all crashing down i had always felt slightly depressed before that, but the relationship coupled with school helped in keeping me focused i spiralled downwards i got aggressive (i am *not* an aggressive person) if/when we talked (after we had broken up, of course), i spent days alone in my room, i didn't want to talk to anyone, didn't want to see anyone it was horrible there is a ton more to that story, but i'll leave it there while all this was happening, one of my best friends pulled me through she would listen, she would help and would be there (after i came out of my shell) we've now been dating for about 1 5 years i graduated from my school program this past winter (music diploma) and am currently back home and working i'm working in order to be able to afford going to berklee college of music in boston without having to take out any student loans i have a good job with the city it is high pay but difficult work overall, i don't hate my job but it's not something i want to do for the rest of my life the problem is being back home since my ex and i broke up, and since i had been away for another year for school, everything back here changed in regards to my friends a lot of them have claimed they 'hate' me (my ex is a compulsive liar, so i can only assume she lied to all of them [they were all mutual friends] and put me in the wrong) and the rest simply don't want to spend time with me i try opening up to them, asking them if they want to do a quick lunch or something - always 'no ' at this point in time, the last time i've spent time with friends was late july i am currently living at home with my parents in order to save more money for school, but the situation here has gotten worse too it seems that since i moved away, my parents started hating each other they sleep in different rooms, never spend more than 2 minutes in the same room together, neglect housework (i do a lot of it now), are passive-aggressive or are simply aggressive i really wish they'd just get a divorce, frankly it's extremely painful to be here and feel the tension a lot of the time they take it out on me, calling me a 'failure,' 'worthless,' etc my girlfriend also lives with me she's living with me because i live closer to the college she's going to than her parents did also, her family is not well off they can save some extra money when she's away, and that's a good thing for them having her here adds a bit of tension, to be honest i love living with her, but there are a ton of rules seeing as we're under my parent's roof no sleeping together (separate rooms) being the most annoying of which (we're both adults) the tension in the house has gotten so strong one night after coming home from work, i asked how my mother is ""i'm pissed at you "" ""why?"" ""did you make a dental appointment?"" ""no, i haven't had time"" ""did you scrape the driveway?"" ""no i haven't had time"" ""well why were you fucking your girlfriend last night then?"" at that point i almost snapped that morning, i had to be at a morning meeting and went to bed really early in order to be rested they knew this of course i didn't have sex with my girlfriend, we're more mature than that - we know not to mess with their rules when we're under their roof i calmed myself down (had i not, i would have erupted in anger [again, not an angry person]) and reaffirmed that i had that morning meeting, informed her that we've been respecting their rules the whole time, that i've been really busy with work and that if i could, i would move the hell away; but can't lastly, i'm not terribly happy with my girlfriend situation i love her, but there is a lot that's bugging me with it i'm an only child, and one of my favorite things about that situation was the inherent privacy that came along with that i get nearly none of that anymore eg: trying to spend some time alone reading, get jumped by her trying to 'play spook' me i dislike my situation i know it seems rather melodramatic and ""teeny,"" but i have never felt this stuck i simply want to move away, move to the mountains for a while and work there; but i can't if i want to go to school next year i want to be in a different city, one where there's less animosity from people i used to consider friends; but i can't i simply want out, but can't thanks if you read all that it's kind of cathartic to get it all out there sorry if it made no sense **tl;dr:** can't leave where i'm living if i want to do what i'm planning on doing, all while facing animosity from all directions and simply want out",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejtxm/in_a_situation_where_i_am_very_stuck_and_hate_it/,1292025910

i wish i could just kill myself!"" which caused her parents to (understandably) freak out x's parents brought her to a mental hospital to be evaluated before bringing her, they made her pack a ""hospital"" bag of clothes for when she was admitted evidently she was evaluated, and the doctor told her parents that she should be admitted x argued with her parents, eventually convincing them to let her be in her own home during her birthday (which was in 3 days) she would have been admitted for a week since then, whenever she misbehaves or talks back, they threaten her with returning to the hospital so that she can be committed since the hospital they have also been giving her anti-depression medicine however, she still tells me she has thoughts of suicide and killing herself, so that her parents would ""understand the pain"" they ""put her through"" because of the hospital trip, she cannot share any of these feelings with anyone but a few close friends, however recently, her parents found a towel with blood on it, from a nosebleed, and assumed she was cutting herself her mom yelled at her about it, and when she said it was from a nosebleed she said ""it doesn't look like a nosebleed!

encv9,depression,MissingKel,all about kel: a verbose vent and a relatively lost guy,"greetings, reddit made a throwaway for no particularly discernible reason other than to give me no reason not to post this i do not ordinarily make habit of publicizing my thoughts, problems, or conflicts, but the presence of this subreddit has been nagging at me for days (perhaps weeks) now i do not frequently talk about myself at all, really, so this is going to be very awkward for me, and it's likely to show also, i'm incredibly verbose it's hard not to be, for some reason, so i also apologize for 'the book' this is perhaps to be more a rant than anything else, but i feel that i do need some guidance i am a 21-year old gay male, tall, not overweight but not particularly in shape either i'm certainly more logical than emotional, and in my relatively limited experiences with the world of 'feelings', i've found that not a whole lot matters to me this isn't to say that i've always been depressed as much as it says that i've never felt i had the capacity to be until now i'm an avid programmer, by hobby and for work, and i find i spend a lot of time working on my computer, and online, but not so much that it eclipses other aspects of my life in early 2006, i met a group of people in an online game and talked with them quite a bit a few of them became very good friends, over time, having met 2 of them in person later, and having the other eventually become a long-term business partner the third and final person of note was a very creative and 'feisty' (for lack of a better word) 18-year old (at the time) girl who, for the purposes of remaining semi-anonymous, i'll refer to as kel if any of you have read snow crash by neal stephenson, you might know what i mean when i say she was very much like yt, in personality kel had an unfortunate medical condition which, for the good part of her life, has kept her severely underweight, weak, and generally unable to be very physically active her family was caring for her kel and i would talk about all manner of things, but most of the time, it would come back to 'the future' there was hope in the future for her to become more physically capable and mobile, and she and i shared a lot of common desires for the future; most notably, we both wanted to travel a great deal travel is a fairly juvenile 'dream' but undeniably an alluring one over time, we developed plans to travel around the us, by road for months and months we would talk about all the normal topics life, the universe, boys, girls, anything and everything we grew very close, over time ""cosmic twins,"" she would call us fast-forward to early 2010: there appeared the opportunity of a potentially dangerous surgery that would correct most of her medical problems and leave her more mobile and capable of achieving her (our) dreams she was apprehensive, understandably, as was her family other friends and i encouraged her to make her own decision eventually, it was decided that she would rather try and fail than simply die without having tried (inevitably, she would have succumbed to medical complications if she chose not to perform the surgery ) late 2009, she enters the hospital for one of many procedures preparing her for a surgery i lie awake at night, every night, waiting to hear that she's alright she is over the next few weeks, though, she's in and out of the hospital for a variety of relatively minor complications then, all seems to be fine, and they move on to the next stage this, however, does not seem to go as planned there are a myriad of complications and for the next 3-4 months, she is once again in-and-out of the hospital eventually being more in than out we stay in communication frequently by text message, though the frequency of messages went down over time in june 2010, i receive a message from her family, notifying me that she had passed away peacefully due to medical complications resulting from the 'second stage' and, i suppose, this event in particular is the real center of the problems i'm coming to you about now the following months, all the way up to the present day, have been some of the most confusing and depressing months i have ever experienced, which is an incredibly strange thing to hear myself say if you knew me, you might agree i loved kel more than i have any other person, and more than i'm likely to ever love anyone again, which is entirely confusing to me on so many levels i have previously experienced loss in my life, of people who were close to me (my mother, all four grandparents), but nothing has compared to this being a relatively unemotional person, i found those losses to be significant events, but i don't think i've ever been devastated quite like i have been at the loss of kel even thinking about it is somehow causing an involuntary tremble like that i experienced when i first received the news something i've never felt before everything i do in my life reminds me of her and that she's gone all my goals are gone- to travel without her would be dull, to design ones own house would be unimportant, to meet new people would be pointless i fully recognize that this altered perspective is being forced upon me by my depression at suffering a personal loss, but the logical understanding of that is lost on me my life has ground to a halt and there feels to be no reason to move forward being a very logical person, i've understood that if i can work through this, my perspective will change for the better and i won't regret doing it but my emotions don't care about logic, and despite my best attempts, they seem to be ruling over me more than i'd like to let them this long-winded post simultaneously adequately describes my situation and doesn't do kel justice as i've described her in the end, i think most of this was a rant, but i'm looking for help of some kind too of what kind, i'm unsure just that i recognize that i'm incapable of finding my own path out from where i've put myself in my life perhaps if anyone could offer some insight on how to make sense of what i'm feeling, and how to let my rational mind take back over and deal with how my life has backed up thanks for reading this, if you've gotten this far i don't necessarily expect or require much in the way of feedback, especially for something this lengthy, but it would be greatly appreciated nonetheless tl;dr unemotional robot, met people, met kel, talked with kel, loved kel, lost kel, still love kel, miss kel, world revolves around kel, suddenly emotional robot, lost robot",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/encv9/all_about_kel_a_verbose_vent_and_a_relatively/,1292584401

she was working very little (part time), had no real hobbies and social life on a daily basis (although she still managed to find things to occupy her) her life was ok, but looking back everything was in limbo - i recognized that she was not dealing with any outstanding emotional issues, and as a very stubborn person by nature, it was hard to get anything out of her i stayed at home during my undergrad, partially because i didn't want to leave her alone in such a relatively big house (she needed someone to do all the heavy lifting, grocery shopping, etc ) fast forward to this summer - i finished my undergrad, got accepted to grad school a few hours away from home, and decided that i was finally going to move away (i'm 23 now) at around this time, my mother began to show a change of heart, and said that she wanted to sell the house (it was getting older and needed some work that we had not enough money for, and too much space for 1 person to live in ) i was happy that she decided to do this, so over the next couple of months, spent a lot of time cleaning out all the junk that she had accrued over the last decade (quite the task i must say) by end of summer we managed to sell the house, buy her a really nice and affordable condo about 15 minutes away from the previous locations, and clean out all of her crap i also moved away around this time, but have visited her almost every weekend since then during the move, she began to really worry me - she lost a lot of weight (she is skinny to begin with), stated being very negative and indecisive, and her self esteem went down i hoped that this was all going to end when she finally moved in to her new condo and settled in, but i was wrong it got to the point where we went to multiple doctors and psychiatrists looking for some solution to her state of mind, and on multiple accounts was told that she needs to take medication (anti-depressants and anti-anxiety) in order to cope with this problem she's very cynical of any type of medication, and it was almost impossible to talk her into taking the anti-depressents she's been attending weekly meetings with her psychiatrist, and says she is taking her medication (but refuses to take the anti anxiety meds), but after 3 months of this we have seen no positive change, but rather a continued increase in depression my father has been talking to her a lot, as well as friends and myself, but without much success she's alone in this condo, and every day i keep feeling more and more scared very recently she has made some concerning statements: she say's that she is losing any drive to live, and had called me last week to say goodbye to me i feared the worst, but then she explained that she wanted to be admitted to the hospital and feared the doctors would ""dope her up"" [sic] so much that this was the last time i was ever going to see her normal my dad agreed to take her to the hospital, but again she refused she's losing touch with reality, and her being unsupervised is not comforting to me my dad has been trying to help any way he can, but this seems to do more harm then good at this point, she keeps fixating on my father, saying that she wants to get back together and have a ""proper family"" as she always wanted meanwhile, my dad has his own life now, and this will never happen (they just dont work together) i'm coming home for the holidays, but it's really hard for me to spend time with her without yelling or feeling upset, largely because nothing i try seems to be working i don't know what else to do - should i admit her to a facility (which she will not be happy with), or take time off school and try and help her by being close to her (this is temporary, as i have to finish school sooner or later)? how do i get her to take the anti-anxiety meds? any suggestions from redditors in similar circumstances? how did you cope with this? what seemed to work best? tl;dr: my mother is depressed, and therapy + medicine is not working after 3 months her condition is worsening, and there are hints of suicide in her thoughts at this point what can i do to help? thanks in advance guys and girls",2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/enn9e/need_advice_about_depressed_mother/,1292625962

enylk,depression,ThrowAwayOrNot,time to give back some help,"hello /r/depression, warning, long and first post, but worth it i believe edit : here's a tl, dr; : 1) identify what is it you have 2) acceptance of your state of mind and thoughts 3) find the right ssris 4) find the right therapist 5) go on with usual advices ( eat properly, do sports, get out of apartment, see people, talk to friends, drink less etc) 6) don't read too much stories of depressions, don't read too much people bragging about their happiness either 7) profit (probable throw away account, given this thread and those i plan to make for /r/bdsm :) ) i'm on my way to recovery, and i'd like to share what i think are the basics of overcoming a depression i read lots of good advices here and elsewhere, and i think it's fair to give back now that i'm better obvious and mandatory statement : i'm not a doctor, this is just my take on the problem, from my experience and other's experiences i'm not going to detail my story, unless you're interested, for reasons i'll detail below also, english is not my first language, apologies for typos and such 1) identification the first, most important thing, is to realize if you have or not a depression it may sound simple, but some people have other issues - such as insomnia, anxiety - which may be depression symptoms but might as well be a complete separate issue, which won't be solved the same way also, if you're a teenager, remember it's very common to feel depressed and dark at this age it's temporary, it doesn't mean your condition is not real or that you exaggerate it, but the good news is you can be fine by just waiting it out ( in general, and if you *can*), which is not the case about most depressions now, the steps to recovery : you'll find many resources about depression that give (very good) advices, such as doing sport, simply walk out of your house, try to force yourself into meeting people, eat well -very well actually-, talk to friends and family, get a hobby, go to /r/getting_over_it, listen to new music all of these are good advices, and you should do them at one point, now if you can but the problem is you're probably too depressed to actually do any of it or see any point to it that's depression for you : you just can't cope with yourself, your issues 2) acceptance first step to overcome this is, is acceptance : depression is quite common, and happens to a large variety of people you're not weak, bad, whatever, it's just happened to you, like cancer may happen to people : there are causes, and sometimes it just happens out of the blue it may be bad luck or any other reasons, but don't dwell on the causes too much for now you must accept your depression, accept your bad thoughts and state of mind don't try to reject them, they'll come back stronger the basic thought mechanism is ""ok, it sucks immensely, this is clear, but this is normal this is ok i'll deal with it bad thought number1 : you're here, i acknowledge you, you're part of me i'll sort you out "" then try to *gently* push the thought away, don't repress it strongly my first, natural reaction was to try to strongly reject the bad thoughts, but that's not helping at all this is something therapy taught me and i can confirm it's true : it's making you more obsessional, drives you crazy, till the ""i want to die"" thought becomes overwhelming so learn to truly accept your depression, and in mind this is solvable, you're not the first or the last one to be in this horrible shitty state of mind and you won't be the first or the last one to overcome it of course you don't believe me or yourself for now ( i wouldn't have as little as 4 months ago), this is ok too , just consider you have absolutely nothing to lose in trying this, except maybe money, but money worth shit compared to your well being so spend it there / earn more to get through, it worth it now, i advocate the combination antidepressants (ssris) + therapy 3) find the right ssris you might have read a lot of shit about ad, and maybe it scares you i'd just say that : i thought it would be the worst thing to do to myself, but they basically saved my life the important part is to find the right one for you if you don't feel less ""dark"", if you don't have less bad thoughts after a month after a month of treatment, or if the side effects are too bad, you must change brand many doctors have no clues about ad and give them away and basically let you deal with it you must find the right one, don't hesitate to change (especially if side effects are worse than the depression, which is something that may happen) brand or doctor even if you feel uncomfortable with them the right ad don't make you feel ""empty"" or zombified they don't make you happy either, it's a misconception they just make you have less bad thoughts, and make you able to deal with them (you become less obsessional / anxious about them, which in turns make them less strong) this will make therapy much, much more efficient for you it will give you a break, and make you able to deal with your issues 4) find the right therapist now, there are many therapists, like there are many ad analytical, behavioral, mix of two, and good and bad therapists i've been blessed by finding a good one at my first shot, but this hasn't been the case for other peoplei know remember therapist may suck at their job, like any other employee in any specialty so same thing as for ad, be prepared to change (the sucky thing is that you have to give it a go for a month approximately, don't switch too early) 5) go on with ""classic"" advices with this, you should be much more prepared to go through the other advices ( sport, eat well etc, ref point 1), and continue your recovery process 6) don't read too much stories of depressions, don't read too much people bragging about their happiness either another thing i find useful, is to not read too much stories about depression it might be obvious, but yeah this makes you feel more depressed even if you're first comforted by the fact you're not alone experiencing shit in your life that's why i won't detail my story in this post at the opposite of the scale, don't read too much bragging / i'm super happy threads or articles either, for a similar reason it may make you jealous, sad , envious, more obsessional just read the recovery / solutions bits if you can, and don't read the story or don't pay attention to it last but not least, if you have grown in a religious environment, you're facing an extremely hard challenge in addition, whether you're still a believer or not i feel too lazy to detail it now but you can google it (religious envrionment / depression) 7) profit i hope i helped i'm still not a great state of mind as i speak, but all those advices made me get over the darkest, most hopeless, period of my life the ""badness"" i feel now is ok and will be dealt with in time, i'm just happy i got out of the ""no hopes and plenty of obsessional bad thoughts"" phase it's getting better and better, and i now i'll be well at one point",10,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/enylk/time_to_give_back_some_help/,1292692041

if you see a wounded animal, it's obviously in pain, and it will obviously never pull through -- it will simply die in agony, slowly -- wouldn't it be far better to simply put it out of its misery, than let it suffer? and truly, i am suffering i cannot take this pain it's the worst feeling in the world and it's perpetual it never ceases there is no let up even when i cycle to my ""hypomania"" phase, i don't feel any of the euphoria associated with a manic state i get more work done, i have more energy, but am i happy? no do i feel better about myself? no i can never have children i refuse i will not put any child through this hellish nightmare i broke up with my girlfriend because i couldn't bear to put her through my shit any longer she couldn't understand that it wasn't her that was making me unhappy she couldn't understand that no matter how hard she tried to please me, i was incapable of enjoying anything food doesn't taste good jokes aren't funny sex is meh even hard drugs offer little in the way of comfort, and coming off them simply compounds the problem i want to die i'm afraid to die but that's all i want at this point **edit:** wow, quite a few responses i guess i should follow up i wrote this post because i was feeling particularly shitty and felt like i needed an outlet for that shittiness i wasn't really expecting much beyond ""qq more ya noob"" so i haven't really checked since i posted it first, thanks for all your responses i tend to think the worst of people when it comes to what they think about me, so it's hard to expect much empathy from others one of the most annoying things about this whole process for me is that changing doctors is not a fun process everytime i have to find a new shrink i have to wait 2 months for an appointment in this case, i made an appointment in october, and it's not until jan 4th soonest i could find my previous doctor treated me like a criminal the moment i admitted to having self medicated with pot (something i don't particularly recommend) i was under the impression i was supposed to be honest with my doctor, and not expect judgment i've brought up the possibility of ect before, and was told we should look to drugs first i don't really want to look to drugs first i mean, it seems to me it's a pretty safe, effective and painless process with few side effects, so why not? why endure all the endless side effects and weight gain that comes with the cocktail of pills they expect me to take? i've been on so many pills i can't remember all of them i've tried eating better, getting more exercise (i've lost 50lbs since my last birthday), getting more regulated sleep, etc and i do feel better physically, but i'm still the same wreck i've always been emotionally at this moment, i can't say i'm at the same point i was when i wrote the original post i want to live, but it's hard knowing that at any moment something might trigger those feelings of hopelessness again and my appointment is still 2 weeks away i only have one week of medication left",15,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eofqh/i_want_to_die/,1292791693

eoheh,depression,rklex,i am way beyond apathetic i've essentially muted my emotions,"sorry it's long winded but i'm not sure exactly how to get what's happening across **tl;dr: my grandmother got lunge cancer and passed grandfather brought in other woman, and made a spectacle in public never grieved don't know how to start to get over it and get emotions back ** growing up my family was tight knit around my grandmother we lived about a mile away from her we were always there i remember her house better than my own it wasn't just my parents and my two sisters, it was also my two cousins and my aunt who lived half an hour away i remember us all being there everything she did was amazing she cooked, she made us costumes for school plays she decorated not only the house, but the outside, like for halloween she would put carved pumpkins all up and down the drive way the neighbors even let her use their large side yard to put up more lights and such everything felt like home when she did it she supported us (being the 5 grandchildren) in everything we did she took us to soccer practice, walked us to school, did whatever was needed to help then when i was in 4th grade she was diagnosed with lunge cancer we watched her go from a lively active woman, to sick and tired it was the worst when it spread to her brain and changed her then shortly after, she passed i was maybe ten when she passed the situation got worse at the time i didn't think anything could make life worse than my grandmother dying, but my grandfather found a way to do it he moved another women into my grandmothers house not 2 months after it happened we were still trying to sort my grandmothers things this woman he brought in told us that she was going to throw it all out and if she found us at the house again she was going to call the cops things were tense not only at home, but also in public all of the grandchildren played soccer, and scenes happened at the local soccer league between my father and grandfather that turned into shouting and us leaving early many hateful things were said everything was a complete wreck i didn't know how to go to my family about it the one memory i have about crying for my grandmother after the funeral is of us in the house that my grandmother grew up in it was late at night, i couldn't sleep as it was the first time we had gone back there i started crying and my sister said as in how i remember it, ""crying isn't going to bring her back "" knowing my sister, that isn't something she would tell me but that's how it stuck so there i was, lost without the center of my life, not knowing how to deal with, thinking that i shouldn't cry about it i made it through school ok, never doing great nor terrible, just doing what i feasibly thought was reasonable from the teachers i moved through highschool doing well in what i thought was interesting but didn't need much work my work ethic diminished, in most aspects i had been a soccer fanatic and the star of any team i played with not too much later that stopped, i played well and on competitive teams, but never stuck out or really progressed i never finished games, i would get to the end of them and just stop when it came time to decide what to do for higher education i picked something easy because i had no interest in anything i still really don't the things that really trouble me are 1) i can't find a way to not half ass anything, esp school work i wait till last second, or don't do it at all growing up i was a come home from school do it then kinda kid 2) i can't say i've grown attached to more than handful of people nor can i say i've remotely cared for any girl i've dated it's always been more of a companion thing i never use them physically, i've found that since i noticed i don't care i've becoming incredibly timid with women i always let them lead because if i don't i really do feel like i'm using them 3) i feel like i haven't grieved for my grandmother i can't so much think about her without crying it's been long and hard getting through this 4) i don't seem to feel much of anything my second room mate in college told me that he couldn't read how i was feeling about anything until i was pushed to far and went to anger (which rarely happens) i talked for a few sessions to a psychiatrist in training or so, a woman finishing her doctorate at my school she picked up on most of my things, such as the not caring for my gf i all of this with her she told me that she thinks i have a mild reoccurring depression and muted emotions, but i can't remember the name of it the semester ended, she was graduating, and i was moving back home the sessions stopped and i went back on with normal life, going through with just work and playing ultimate ignoring my blankness once again **how would i go about getting over this i now live over seas going to school, and won't as much see my family for another 7 months so i find it very hard talking to them about it what are things i can start to do to help with this and get life back in me?** i know i always hear everyone grieves differently, but i just don't know how i do it's starting to get me way down again, and i want to take care of it before i get over it for the time being and ignore it again if you made it through this, thank you very

ep85m,depression,tatertotty,"how to detach from parents? at the very least, how to cope?","hey lovely reddit first time in this subreddit, though the reddit community in general has helped me through some tough times i apologize in advance for ranting rambling babbling, but i desperately need help coping with the parents the history might take a bit long to outline so let's get started my parents and i have always had a very rough relationship both are very well educated and live very disciplined, strict lifestyles ever since i was young, i always felt like they were making me grow up way faster than i should've been even silly silly things that only make sense in retrospect: being disciplined for having a baby blanket, ridiculed (and i mean serious ridicule) whenever i did/said something childish, and (i say this bitterly but with some embarrassment) throwing away any stuffed animals or toys when they felt i was becoming too dependent anyway, childhood stuff aside, this is the kind of attitude they raised me with i was constantly put into academic programs that were 3+ years over my class level, not because of talent or intelligence but just because they decided i'd ""be able to handle it "" i started fantasizing about suicide when i was still fairly young, around 8-10 (i know this because of the dates on some drawings and some things i'd written), but never seriously attempted suicide in my early pre-teens i also had to abide by a strict curfew so i'd only ever have contact with friends saturday afternoon (this curfew was generously extended to 7pm saturdays by the time i entered high school) unfortunately for them, i also lost my virginity quite young to avoid a tangent about that, let's just say i kept my mouth shut about it (it was my idea, completely consensual), but my best friend snooped in my diary and turned me into the school parent teacher association and my parents found out pretty quickly i was basically told to my face that i was no better than a prostitute, that i had shamed the family, that i didn't deserve my last name, bla bla bla this confrontation was a long and drawn out one, but the message was always the same my father then decided he would not speak to me for the next two years though we lived in the same house (i was grounded in my room for a few months and not allowed to leave the room unless it was for bathroom or food, then after i was ""ungrounded"" from the room i was allowed to be in public areas but my father would basically act like i was a ghost and would not address me or respond) wonderful environment for a kid huh? ;) during this period there was some rebelling on my part, i e piercing my own nose and smoking cigarettes, but nothing too mind-blowing after some good grades (and still not being spoken to by my father), i was given 3 hour non-internet access on the family computer to complete homework assignments, and a lovely 30 minute allowance to ""play"" on the internet i didn't know it at the time, but my father also installed a keylogger and regularly reviewed my history, and i was frequently punished whenever i would visit a ""bad"" website or say something bad about my family on the internet (took me long enough to figure out what a keylogger was) i looked up the abortion pill once out of curiosity, and had my internet privileges restricted and my mother promptly informed me that women who took that pill would almost certainly die i continued living in this hell hole, rebelling here and there (my parents would find an empty cigarette carton, or i would be a little late for my curfew, or i would be caught masturbating no joke, kind of embarrassing to admit it though) when i was 16, my parents caught me sneaking out to a friend's goodbye party, and they simply had enough with me and my dad packed a little gym bag full of clothes and sent me on my way i crashed at a boyfriends house, dropped out of school (you try even giving a shit about school after that happens), and got a job graphic designing and bartending (i lived overseas so being underage was not even questioned, and my 20y o bf was already in the industry so he hooked me up) this is not as bad as it sounds, trust me, it was a relief from what i had known i was in touch with my mother, who would sometimes want to see me just to see how i was doing and to slip me some pocket money anyway, after a little less than a year, i felt like a fucking loser and like i wasn't getting anywhere i knew i had to make it back to the us where there was at least some chance of me getting ahead i literally called up a ""meeting"" with my parents, and my dad and mom both pretty much knew that i was asking for forgiveness they decided it was best for me to ""start fresh"" and to move to the us to finish high school i left within the next two weeks and finished my senior year of high school on my own, getting rent payments from my parents and just kind of bs-ing thru the year i got like a 4 5 or something ridiculous, went to a so-so uc school, and here i am at age 20 i am sooo grateful that my parents are financially supporting me they have paid all my college expenses and even offer a small allowance for living expenses i cannot ever be thankful enough but you know what? i have been fucking acting for the past 3 years, ever since i called them back up for forgiveness i have been an entirely different person i know we all hide our personality to an extend with parents, but i fucking seriously hide it i am an entirely different person, to the point where i sometimes can't keep a straight face because honestly, it's ridiculous the problem is, how do i keep a healthy detachment going? how can i cope with my parents? i am so sick and tired of playing a different role but since they are supporting me, i cannot be an ungrateful little brat today they told me to my face that i should not pursue x career (career i have been working towards for the past few years) because i simply can't cut it, simply not the type, simply can't cope with the type of people it was basically another way of telling me that i am not smart enough this is the same kind of thing they've told me my entire life, yet i have proved them wrong every single time i was my class president for 3 years in a row, high school drop out maybe but i ended up in university with a 3-year double major both with highest honors i tell them over and over again that i can do it, that i can cut it, but i just feel like a useless shithead like i have my whole life i'm so sorry reddit for this huge ass wall text honestly i need some advice, some perspective, even just a comment from a redditor who has any clue what the fuck i should do i am very very grateful for everything they have done to help me but they like the act i am putting up, not the person i really am i am stuck here for the rest of xmas so it would be nice to have some redditor opinions tl;dr: parents super strict, i've been a sobfest about it for the past decade, need to detach but not financially dependent edit 12/24/10: thank you for your comments just wanted to keep you wonderful lovely people updated, but i had my first panic attack yesterday i'm ashamed to say i always considered panic attacks to be some sign of weakness, or some gesture of defeat, but after yesterday i feel immense respect for anyone who can carry themselves through such a scary experience i think both my anxiety with food and my relationship with my parents is causing it, i really thought i was about to die and have been barely able to leave my bedroom or even hear my sister's voice how surreal i feel like an insane person",4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ep85m/how_to_detach_from_parents_at_the_very_least_how/,1292919113

ertg7,depression,JustNotWorkingAtAll,i just don't feel like doing anything,"i'm 17 and i still don't have any plans for myself my family emigrated here in europe to have a better life i have been living here for three years already and days go by, the life here on what i expected to be was far from what i thought in exchange for having a decent life, bad things keep happening to me making friends here is completely different in my home country people i've met are very friendly to me in comparison to where i was born in here, you don't see people see your mistakes at all if they were to see you do something foolish, they don't mind at all it's like every person wants their environment to be i'm not used to it i know it is weird but i just feel i don't belong here blending in this kind of environment feels uncomfortable to me being at school made me feel like a nobody even though you had those friendly people around you, it did not work (it was hopeless) at the end of the school year, i made zero progress of having friends yes, i talked to some people in my class and in other classes as well but none of them was really a friend for me then we moved to another city which was quite excited since it is near to my relatives after a year there lived my cousins, uncle and aunt one of my cousin was the one who i was very close with we hang out most of the time we meet he introduced me to his friends he belonged in a youth group from there, i met people who are younger, same and older than me it felt like home talking to people who spoke the same language and came from the same place this is where i met a very special girl i was clueless at that time i am not going to brag but she fell for me badly she would call me or text me whenever she could we had our happy moments and memories it's every guy would want to be with i was interested in her but i could not express it all i did was to tell her things over the chat which i did not do at all there was all talk but nothing was done it is quite pathetic that she was about to leave but i told her to stay and give me another chance but i blew all of it as we were visiting another youth group just next to the city, i saw an attractive girl at first i hesitated to talk to that girl but i found a chance while we were there, i would most of the time talk to that girl ignoring the one who i made a promise with i was so ignorant that i did not notice what i did finally she gave up on me and i let her go after a few months, i felt that something was missing how i missed out every chance to stay by her side i was pathetic thinking every moment that i hurt her she finally came to our house with her parents i talked about and how sorry i am and if i were given a chance, i would not mess it up again and she said something that made me realize that it was already over that she already moved and so should i this made me regret all the stupid things i did to her after more than a year, i still couldn't move on i kept looking over pictures of her and try talking to her but it was not the same anymore the guilt had me clinging to her memories and lingering on the past it really hurts to see someone go away from your life this event was only one of the things that i hated to happen my uncle had a conflict with my mom it was about me quitting on a position of the group this made my uncle hate me and really affected my relationship with not only him but to my cousin as well it all came falling down losing people you loved really hurt i never had any contact with them it became a huge impact on me which really kept me thinking i am very depressed i already went to a therapist and it did not help not even a little i feel helpless and nothing to turn to not even my mother she already had enough problems struggling to feed and i would not want to be a nuisance i keep telling to myself that it would be okay but its not with all these happened to me, i lost my motivation i lost interest on what i like to do most nothing really makes me happy now",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ertg7/i_just_dont_feel_like_doing_anything/,1293412258

i scored in the 90's in the asvab, which opens most if not all jobs in the air force then i found out, i'm medically disqualified from enlisting i had pins in my arm from surgery, broke my arm, when i was 13, i also had scoliosis, and i saw a shrink when younger great, you can get waivers for all of them which i did, to the point where i considered having the pins removed long story short, it never went anywhere now since i never planned, nor wanted to go to college as stated, i had no back up plans so, i went to the local community college 2003 rolls around and like most people i was feeling particularity patriotic, the us about to invade iraq not long on the heels of 9/11? i went to the army recruiter, this time i got as far as the meps station when they started asking me questions i admitted i had seen a shrink, they already knew right? turns out, my army recruiter neglected to put that on the paperwork oops, if i had known, i would have lied about it so, i had to sit out meps, and arrived back at square one again so, back to community college again around this time i met a girl who unfortunately i saw on average once or twice per week i always drove to see her, about 50 miles, and she never once visited me, which annoyed me to know end, and she knew it but, she hated driving, and i liked her eventually we started drifting apart, and i, being an idiot, cheated completely my fault, and unforgivable i never told her after i finished, i transferred to a local state school my first year there, was probably the most depressing i'd ever felt i had no friends, i didn't know anyone, and while within driving distance from home, what was the point? i had one friend at home, and wasn't close to my family my ex and i started to talk again, and we even talked about getting back together in the middle of all this she started dating another guy, completely within her right, but, i felt betrayed should i have? of course not, but i was lonely, depressed, angry, and like i said, felt betrayed so, in a fit of blind foolish anger, i told her i cheated on her while we were together i wanted her to feel the pain i thought she deserved for letting me think we'd get back together i know what you're thinking, that's pretty fucked up i know it is and i don't make any excuses for it anymore it took four years but we eventually became 'friends' again, we'd talk every once in a while, but not hang out though every once in a while we still talk about getting back together, we both know it'd never work it took me those four years to finally forgive myself for what i did anyways, back at school i eventually made a friend who was surprisingly a lot like me, minus the anger i almost always felt he was honestly the only friend i made that year in my second year i made an effort to be more sociable, i was tired of being alone, depressed, and angry and you know what? it worked, for who years i was pretty sociable i had a decent amount of friends i went to the occasional party, the first party i had ever been to? i was 21-22 so, i graduated and moved back home with my parents after getting a temp job working hr for a medical company but who cares right? i have loads of friends now, people who want to hang out and shit times a re still pretty good eh, sort of of all the 'friends' i made at college only two seemed to remember me after i graduated so, every once in a while i'd drive the 90 minutes to school and hang out for the weekend in sept '09 my two best friends from college decided to move in together in the local city sweet! best mates? city life? i thought we'd hang out, go out to bars, make loads of other friends, etc i mean, what could be better? it'll be like how i met your mother! i'll be ted except, it wasn't like that even a little one of my roommates ended up getting a job working second shift, 3-11 well that sucks, and he went home every weekend, about 2 hours away, to see his girlfriend well that sucks even more, this is the first friend i met at college i never felt any sort of grudge or anger towards him, but it would have been nice if he stayed home every once in a while to hang out with his roommates my other roommate, well, she's naturally sociable, she makes friends pretty quickly, pretty easily i, on the other hand, do not while i tend to come across as pretty serious, i also tend to joke around a lot problem is, i say just about everything with a straight face, so people don't know when i'm joking or if i'm being serious so people tend to get angry with me doesn't help that i'm a bit of an ass i freely admit that i don't understand why some people get offended so easily but everyone is different back to where i was for the year i lived in the city, i think i hung out with my sociable roommate only a handful of times to her, hanging out was spending time together to me, hanging out was going *out* and doing something after getting out of work, i spent all my time in the apartment, so why would i want to hang out at it? i wanted to go out, party, meet people, do what you're supposed to do as a 20-something living in the big city so while we hung out every once in a while it became increasingly more rare when she started dating someone, understandably so once again, i fell into depression, to the point where, for no reason at all, i spent an hour crying on the sofa when i was home alone it was then i realized, maybeee i should get on kind of anti-depressant mind you, i'd seen my fair share of therapists, but all they seemed to say was, 'why do you think that is?', well i don't fucking no, how about you tell me and try to help me out some each was more worthless than the next",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esd23/a_private_pityparty_youre_invited_to/,1293507418

etk8w,depression,Aloyarcs,"anxiety ridden, looking for info/advice","iama 17 year old male who's becoming increasingly concerned with anxiety issues which are leading me to feel depressed i have a tendency of being over analytical and i've been losing interest in almost everything back story: depression started playing a role about 3 or 4 years ago i changed schools, lost friends and such to make matters worse my uncle, who was like a father to me, died from liver cancer i took heavily into world of warcraft for about 2 years i didn't attempt to make friends at my new school, all i cared about was the game i had two close friends at this time, one, (friend a), who was actually a cousin of mine i met at my previous school, and (friend b) a classmate i hung around they both played wow too, so we stayed close i eventually managed to ""get over"" this period of depression in 9th grade i quit wow and decided to try and make friends there was this one girl i had a crush on since the moment i saw her, i still remember seeing her for the first time and even though i remained distant from people, i always tried to be near her in 10th grade we had all of our classes together, finally actually talked and hit it off really well, really really well i don't know if it was my history influencing it, but i finally found like i had someone to go through things with her it wasn't long before i fell in love this was a completely different point in my life, i actually cared about something over than a video game we related in every way possible (but what young love isn't like that?) i admit, it may seem cliche, but i really found someone special to me for the first time in my life, i never felt like i had a friend like her we soon discovered that the feelings for each other were mutual, at least the part where she liked me but there was a problem, she wasn't single her boyfriend (douche) was well, a douche no one liked him and he has no friends except her she started going out with him freshmen year, none of her friends liked him her being in a relationship was really difficult, i guess she thought it was wrong to leave him for someone else we didn't do anything physical she liked video games but was never very serious i bought her some games and we played along side with friend a after months of talking 24/7 she came over to my house she and her boyfriend were fighting, and summer was almost over i kissed her she kissed back we were basically right below making out the rest of the day nothing to physical, just pecks happiest day of my life the next day she was fighting with her boyfriend, i figured she was finally done with him and stuff so i backed off that day, not wanting to ask her about it the next day i ask her, she said everything was fine between them i exploded this was the start of my anxiety my mother has serve anxiety, she isn't medicated, but she gets really bad sometimes shes horribly afraid of shut doors, and is prone to panic attacks so i drop to the floor and start throwing up she says she loves me, but shes not ready to leave him i was relentless and most of the rest of the summer is a blur so i start trying and struggling to remain just friends one night while playing games with her and friend a a thought hit me, they sounded flirty after a few weeks of thinking this i thought i was highly paranoid and becoming my mother i knew i must have been wrong, and i was driving away my friends one day i question her about it and she confesses they like each other my heart was utterly crushed i began thinking i wasn,t good enough panic attacks started increasing in frequency, i began having suicidal thoughts and crying all the time fast forward to school starting back up she broke up with the douche at the beginning of the year she stayed single for a little bit during this time we went to our school's pride day we had fun, which i didn't think was possible anymore my mom had dropped me off and it started raining, so she asked her mom if they could give me for a ride we went to walmart, before dropping me off at my house we rode in the truck and listened to her ipod before i knew it she put on our song and she held my hand this was so utterly shocking to me this sort of things happened a few more times i kept going through periods of extreme optimism and pessimism then a few days later she starts a relationship with friend a after a while she cheats on him with her ex this goes on and off she finally breaks up with friend a goes out with her ex again for awhile (kinda), at this point he was dating another girl she gets fed up with him again, and goes back out with friend a, but not officially damn that weird high school drama shit she went through some more phases of being close to me again, holding my hand and such, nothing ever serious again modern day shes going out with friend a, and i'm kind of accepting it now despite that we aren't doing well she feels that friend b has taken her place of best friend, which he hasn't i've done everything to show how much she means to me i got really bad with depression for awhile i had a few suicidal episodes, but i've never gotten to the point of attempting i think its really started to make her distant over the past month i've gotten really better with the whole depression thing, but our relationship is still in the gutter i'm really concerned with irritating her with psychotic episodes i'm getting bad panic attacks every few days in the past i've feared being put on pills but i'm starting to accept it as an option i do have some fear and concerns my family hasn't been doing financially great lately, but were not too bad off im worried about the cost of treatment, and what treatment for anxiety like this entails tl:dr was depressed, two friends in the world, made a new one, who i thought was basically my soul mate rejected by her, and now shes going out with one of my only other friends this has made me have increasingly serve anxiety and i'm concerned about costs and treatment that i can expect really sorry if this isn't in the right place, or if its poorly

'we're seeing tron and hp5 you should come ' 'i have no money or ride ' 'oh okay ' we were supposed to meet up later at a mutual friend's house and we did but i had spent the last 5 hours alone in my room sulking because my friends didn't want me around i went home, smoked a huge bowl and sulked in my room until the high wore off and then i drove to the meetup my body was there but not me i didn't want to be but you know, by the end of the semester, i was feeling pretty alright this day where my best friend came home and saw me for 3 hours after being gone for 6 months kind of hurt but it was the worst day i'd had in a while in college, i smoked a lot of weed and got a lot done in every class but psych i was happy around people, talkative, and didn't feel drained i felt as close to happy as i can remember now we fast forward to after christmas; so now i decided i wanted to tell my parents about my depression and talking to a social worker and my bad grade my plan was to tell them after new years but we ended up going on a trip to visit relatives in maine until ny eve well today we were sitting around and my 2 brothers were giving me shit about something and my dad joined in and started berating me like usual edit: the rest is in the comments sorry for such a long post really =/",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eu2sk/i_thought_i_was_getting_over_it_things_just_got/,1293781451
