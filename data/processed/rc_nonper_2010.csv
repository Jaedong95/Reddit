t3_amt2d,depression,applextrent,"interesting that you've been on seroquel since 2005 because it was only recently approved for major depressive disorder and i imagine it would only be used in a case where someone presents with psychotic disturbances. seroquel is an atypical anti-psychotic originally used for treating bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. although at 10mg you were on a lower dose. anyhow, many stores have drug programs now where you can get commonly prescribed drugs. bigger chains such as target, and wal-mart tend to have the most buying power so they tend to offer the best deals and offer the most drugs. there's usually some kind of initial buy in like $15 a month, plus the cost of the drugs (which can be as low as $4 for 30 pills - although i'm not sure about your meds). from what i can find online for lexapro without a prescription you're looking at around $1.80 a pill, and for seroquel it's around a $1 a pill. if you have your doctor prescribe you higher doses of your meds then cut them in half you can cut the cost in half as well. a pill cutter will set you back maybe $3-5 at any local pharmacy and suddenly your one month supply is now a two month supply. you'll have to pay around $84 combine for a month supply, which if you get the higher doses and cut them that's only $42 a month, which is a small price to pay for mental health. if you can't afford to see your doctor, simply call them and explain the situation. most doctors are comfortable adjusting dosages over the phone without an appointment. meanwhile, the withdrawals from antidepressants can last upwards of a year+ and can cause depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, insomnia, and a host of other conditions. it's best to taper slowly (like over the course of 6-12 months). so even if you end up without meds in the long run you will improve with time as your withdrawals go away, but it can literally take a year to feel ""normal"" which with your conditions ""normal"" is potentially a pretty shitty place to be. unfortunately i don't know much about buying online or internationally. best of luck to you.",1,0,1,1262910331

t3_anebo,depression,aenea,"i've tried to learn not to look at my life in terms of success or failure, but in terms of experiences. by most outward appearances i'd likely be considered a 'failure' by much of society- i've battled depression/anxiety most of my life, i've been married and divorced more than once, i don't have a career because of my kids' disabilities, and i'm poor as shit. most of those things happened because of choices that i made, but i don't consider myself or my life a failure at all. i've learned from my mistakes (which means that i just get to keep on finding new ones to make), and they've all contributed to the person i am, and i'm not all that bad. when you look at the things that 'society' considers to be successful it's pretty screwed up- pretty house, loads of friends, happy relationships, sparkly perfect children, perfect happiness all the time. i've yet to meet anyone who has accomplished all of those things- the people that i know who are well-off financially are still as screwed up as everyone else, and the people that i know who are what i would consider 'happy' have usually gotten that way after many, many 'failures'. you might have a dream that you're working towards, and all that you can see is the times that you've tried for it and failed. but most of those failures probably have something to teach you- it's all in the way that you look at it. one of my favourite anecdotes (even though it's probably fake), is about thomas edison. ""the story goes that ""thomas edison failed more than 1,000 times when trying to create the light bulb"". (the story is often told as 5,000 or 10,000 times depending on the version.) when asked about it, edison allegedly said, ""i have not failed 1,000 times. i have successfully discovered 1,000 ways to not make a light bulb."" there's a lot of truth to that. i don't think that you're just complaining- we all filter our view of our own lives through our own perceptions, but sometimes it helps to look at things from a different angle. most relationships (romantic or friendship) fail at some point- the key is to make them as meaningful as possible while they last, and to keep reaching out. the same with life- what you're doing may not work, so look at why it didn't, try to make changes, and try it again.",3,0,3,1263032284

t3_b3akl,depression,applextrent,"prozac has a proven track record for treating unipolar depression, however like any drug it has risks. at 17 your brain is not fully developed yet, and the effect of altering it with medications are unknown. these drugs can also be extremely hard to get off of, and can cause extreme withdrawal symptoms that can last up to a year or more (the longer you're on them and the higher the dose typically the worse the withdrawal symptoms, although there are some people who don't experience as many symptoms of withdrawal and no one knows why). currently there is a trend where people who were put on antidepressants in their teens that are now in their 20's are now being diagnosed with mood disorders such as a bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia. antidepressants can actually make mood disorders worse as they can induce hypomania and mania. not that i'm trying to diagnosis you or anything, just simply stating it's hard to get a proper diagnosis at such a young age because your brain simply isn't fully developed yet. if your family has a history of bipolar disorder then this is something you should likely discuss with your doctor, as they may want to use a low dose mood stabilizer instead of an antidepressant or use both. it's also important to track how long you've been depressed, and to consider other variables such as life events that may be causing depression, poor eating habits, poor sleeping habits, consuming large amounts of caffeine, not getting enough sunlight or exercise, etc. for many people, eating right, maintaining a normal sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and drugs, and getting sun and exercise are enough to keep their depression in check. alternatively, there are many supplements on the market that are effective for treating depression such as st. john's wort, and same. if you're not depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts or other self harm behavior i would suggest looking at alternative treatments, as well as continuing therapy, and discussing alternative treatments with your doctor before taking meds. if you are depressed to the point of not functioning, suicidal, or self harm then i would probably start the antidepressants but still continue to improve your lifestyle, and educate yourself on depression, anxiety, and the potential for developing mood disorders as you get older.",3,0,3,1266445374

t3_b8eoa,depression,[deleted],"are you familiar with [depressive realism]( it seems to be exactly what you describe. recent articles on depression (admittedly, from rather pop science publications) suggest that depressed people may lack the short-sighted optimism necessary to function normally in human society, even positing that it is an evolutionary advantage. having been on both sides of the fence (and usually trying to walk the razor thin line between sanity and depression), i don't completely buy depressive reality. when i'm depressed, i certainly do. and i do believe that you need to have some sort of rose-colored glasses on, otherwise, your internal monologue will tear you and your life apart, one comment a time. the problem with depression is that it colors everything you do, causing you to lose interest in things you genuinely enjoy. you are absolutely right in that sex, tv, and such are quite overrated. it is ok to not be enamored with them. too many people, quite literally, lose themselves to those things because their personality isn't strong enough to not let it define them. to see the bullshit that people strive after all their life is extremely depressing. it is also reality. thus, you need to make peace with it somehow. my suggestion: realize that you are not the type of person to hand over yourself to whatever you're told to like. also realize that this doesn't make you better than others. in fact, it can present difficulties in connecting with others. however, in return, you have more time and desire to funnel towards things you actually do like. i sympathize with you. if i had to choose between my libido and my hobbies, my libido would go...every time. but my subjective experience of the arts is (currently) a deeper reality to me than human sexuality. i hope you have a pursuit you love. because you can hold onto it at least a little when things get really rough. when you start losing interest in *that*, then you know you need additional help - therapy, or talking to a friend regularly. personally, i went to a muse concert last night and i had the time of my life. i think i can make it through the rest of winter pretty ok. :)",19,0,19,1267580346

(there are some other great quotes on that page as well). all of us make mistakes- for some of us, it's the only way that we really learn. for most of us, they're not the end of the world- we don't end up in prison for life, we don't end up dead, and we can still move on from them. some of us need to make the same mistakes time and time again before we learn something, but you can get past them. i'm not sure what your exact problems are- failed marriage, failing out of school, homeless?, but most 'mistakes' can be worked through. if you find that you are making the same mistakes over and over again, i'd try some time with a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioural therapy, as it does help you to change the way that you think about things and approach them. if you don't think that's applicable to you, then try writing down your 'mistakes', and see if you can find a common thread in them. is it that you're too trusting? do your hopes outweigh your skills and possibilities by a wide margin (not many of us are going to be multi-millionaires by our early 20s, or have the most expensive house on the block with a fantastic job and a perfect family). try to figure out what being a 'success' means to you, and work towards that, with the knowledge that you are sometimes going to make mistakes, because you're human.",2,0,2,1268740293

(and, in much of ""mainstream"" western culture, i think there's a pathological degree of denial about how much in our lives that we can't, in fact, control, but that's a whole other post!) the difference in result is that healthy self-examination helps us *do better*. depressive self-criticism paralyzes and debilitates us. so, if you want to look at it from an ""outcomes"" point of view, if your ""inner dialogue"", however you want to label it (self-criticism, self-blame, etc.) isn't helping you do better, then it's not ""taking responsibility"" (because that *would* be constructive), it's internal emotional abuse of you by you, isn't it? and if that's what you're doing to yourself, and you have trouble seeing what's wrong with it, it might be because somebody did it to you, so much, and so early in your life, that it feels ""normal"" to you.",4,0,4,1270879521

t3_ccjsk,depression,godless_communism,"here's the kicker - only you know when you're done seeing the therapist. but yeah, definitely go. the main point of psychology is that we really don't know ourselves as completely as we imagine we do. so you're going to be constantly surprised about yourself. but you're also going to learn how to better understand how you feel about certain things. what's basically going to happen is that you'll eventually get to a point in the session when you're yammering on and on... and you'll unpack this whole laundry list of assumptions you have about the world which require challenging. then you'll be asked to re-examine your assumptions about things. one way to look at human behavior is that it's broken down into three important sites that all reflect and influence each other: thoughts, moods &amp; actions. naturally the important action we want to keep you from is hurting yourself (i'm 40, trust me, life gets much better, easier and even more fun - so please don't hurt yourself). so, in therapy they can work on your thoughts, perhaps show you where your thinking about things has gone off the rails a bit or whatever. please do not be skeptical about therapy working. it works. you're not going to come skipping out of the therapist's office like you've achieved nirvana, but you're going to become more content with yourself and your life. lots of smart, well-educated people have devoted their professional lives to psychology. it works. there are times though when stronger measures are called for and that's when it's time to visit the psychiatrist who can prescribe you medication. most of the medication is there to help with moods (remember thoughts, moods, actions?). anyway, not every session is going to end up with you being happy, but you'll have learned something (hopefully).

t3_cgtdi,depression,a1mck,"hi depressed123, thanks for posting!:-) depression can affect anyone regardless of how famous they are, how rich they are, and how intelligent they are. it knows no bounds, and i also have it, but there is medication to help control it, or you may just need therapy. you need to go to your doctor, and tell him or her what is going on with you. now, if you feel uncomfortable telling the doctor, then just print out what you've posted, and give it to him or her. the doctor will have an insight into what is going on with you that would otherwise take many appointments. if the doctor prescribes you with an antidepressant, then make sure that you keep the doctor informed as to how you're being affected. if you have a negative side effect like insomnia, then don't keep it to yourself. get in right away to let the doctor know, and then he or she will adjust the med accordingly or put you on something completely different. what works wonders for one person will not for another. you've already taken the first step in posting here, and you just need to take another small step and get into the doctor. you don't have to be affected like this anymore. keep at the sports, and the bodybuilding. i'm trying my best to get in shape this summer before university starts up again, but i'm going persevere;-)",4,0,4,1276978186

t3_ci5wp,depression,jayebird11,"i am in a very similar situation. i've been on bupropion for 7 weeks. i was on citalopram as well for about 5 weeks, which had too many side effects, and now i am trying fluoxetine instead. definitely talk to your doctor if you haven't already. ssris (from what my doctors have told me) take up to 6 weeks before you may feel the full effect, though you should start feeling something by week 3 or 4. everyone responds to each drug differently. if the fluoxetine isn't working, maybe something else will. if you do talk to your doctor, i would really recommend (again, if you haven't already) talking to him or her about what the other options are in terms of medication and how each one works. ndris are often used to complement ssris by affecting the different neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine vs. seratonin), which affect different symptoms you may be having, and could be more helpful than an ssri alone. for me, the bupropion helps some with motivation and the citalopram (and hopefully fluoxetine) helps keep the negative thoughts and anxieties under some sort of control. i still feel pretty crappy, but better than i did, and knowing about the medications means i recognize what is benefitting me and what isn't. unfortunately, as aenea, johnnybeagle, and m06w41 mentioned, medication won't fix everything. it can change how you feel, but not what you do, and it only does so much. the last time i worked my way out of a depressive period it was 70% because of attitude and 30% because of change in situation. group and talk therapy are great stepping stones as well. the best thing i've gotten from therapy so far is the 5 minute rule: the minute you think you might possibly want to do something (go for a walk, go shopping, cook, whatever), go do it immediately, before you have a chance to tell yourself why you don't want to. do it for 5 minutes, and if, by the end of that 5 minutes, you really don't want to do it anymore, stop. at least you did 5 minutes.",1,0,1,1277327411
t3_ci5wp,depression,cyanotype,"i agree with everyone else's comments about lifestyle change, but just to talk meds for a minute: fluoxetine takes 4-6 weeks to begin having an effect (it's prozac). it also doesn't work for everyone--didn't work for me. so, you've been on fluoxetine for almost a month--is that right? it may not have kicked in yet. in a few more weeks, your psychiatrist may want to raise your dose. they usually want to try higher doses of a med first, to see if it works at all, before switching meds, because switching is harder on you than raising doses, usually. factor in that fluoxetine takes weeks to work, and you may be on fluoxetine for a few months before it either really works for you or your doctor decides you should switch meds. welcome to the strange, helpful, but odd world of psych meds. there's a lot of fumbling in the dark. but a good psychiatrist can work with you very effectively--as long as you are totally honest with them, you keep track of any side effects you experience, and you tell them when a side effect becomes unbearable. psych meds need lots of tweaking and attentive monitoring, and unfortunately, patients with mental illness are not always good at taking care of themselves, noticing that they feel worse in one side effect area, or staying in touch with their doctors. be a proactive patient. be your own advocate. keep a daily journal if it helps of how you feel, how much you slept, what or if you ate, what you did or didn't do, etc. that can help you see your own improvement and also keep track of side effects as they show up.",1,0,1,1277329167

(ignore this if you're female.) second, and this was huge for me, i heard the [symptoms of low and realized i fit nearly all of them. it's not in the link, but ""not giving a fuck"" is a common symptom--sort of a general disinterest in life. that's where i was. i'm on medication for it now, and i'm finally starting feel like i am who i'm supposed to be. like i'm the guy i was back when i liked myself. finally, exercise makes a huge difference. it releases endorphins that do wonders for fighting depression. i know how hard it is to do it when you're deeply depressed. when i'm in that pit, the depression is almost a physical weight on me. moving takes far more effort than it should, and i get exhausted easily because i just don't give a fuck. force yourself to get moving. go out and run for twenty minutes every other day. just do something. like i said, those are the things that work for me. ymmv. if you need someone to talk to, pm me.",3,0,3,1278272305

t3_cr3pv,depression,a1mck,"hi throwaway__alt, you can change your mindset when you encounter these self-doubts by employing coping techniques such as these: every time that you start to feel a negative thought enter your mind try this - simply breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. this is a very, very ancient technique that will cause your mind to lose focus on the negative thought for a split second, and that will lessen the impact of the thought. - if you are like me, i tend to do self talk about whatever negative thought comes into my mind. what i've found that helps to stop them is by simply clenching my teeth. this stops me from vocalizing my thoughts, and that prevents the negative thought from affecting me as much. - this next technique is very effective, and that is you think of the funniest thing that you can remember, and every time a negative thought enters your mind you think of the funny thought instead. stay away from the booze, or anything else that can alter your mood. additionally, keep away negative movies, or comics...you need to watch comedy, and continually seek out anything that is humourous, and funny. i'm sure you've heard of them before, but give them a try. you might want to speak with your doctor or counsellor about this as they might have an insight into why you're being affected like this. please continue to post to let us know how you're making out.:-)",2,0,2,1279598173

t3_cyz63,depression,philosarapter,"my friend goes to devry, and i live in the area. maybe we should hang out. but lets look at some facts here: 1. you cannot predict the future. you may think you can see clearly what is going to happen, but you can't. the universe is far more complex than anyone can realize. maybe your fantasies of your future are dim, but i promise you, the future will be something you completely didnt expect. 2. its normal for our age to feel without a purpose, unfulfilled, etc. its simply because we are finally given freedom to choose for ourselves what we want to do. you also discover that freedom and purpose are inversely related. the more freedom you have, the less purpose you have and vice versa. the cure for this is to immerse yourself in something new. find new friends, visit new venues, travel, sign up in a club or activity you don't even think you'd like. the happiest people at our age are the busiest. 3. whats the point in killing yourself? death will get you nothing... it is simply nothing. life has everything: the good and the bad, the exciting and the mundane, everything. accept it for what it is. then move forward. 4. find some bigger goal or purpose for your life. write down a list of things you want to do. i'm sure you want to do something bigger in your life than going to school and working a job. what about things like sky-diving, jet-skiing, scuba diving, shark hunting, mountain climbing, etc. find something that sounds awesome and instead of just talking about it, do what you need to do to actually go and do it. then when your done with that, think up another awesome thing you can do. if you are going to die, you might as well accummulate some kick-ass stories before you do.. and who knows you might actually enjoy them.",1,0,1,1281365109

""meet 20 new people"", then go out and force yourself to start meeting people, if you don't like them, then meet another person. force yourself to talk to people... it may be awkward at first but keep doing it until you are comfortable. if your not comfortable talking to people... keep doing it. you have to channel your energy into productive things rather than self-destructive tendencies. start creating friendships instead of breaking them, start exercising rather than cutting, and start highlighting your positive traits rather than your shortcomings.",1,0,1,1281369902

t3_d215i,depression,[deleted],"what your going through is not that abnormal. it just seems you might have stronger feelings than most. many times our mind doesn't really cooperate with our mind. for example one part will tell us to succeed, while the other part will sabotage success because if the fear of greater responsibility or exposure. problem is,yours has manifested into a sort of self depreciating hate. this could come from alot of things, parents being to critical of you, too much responsibility at too young of an age. it could be other things as well, but saying so, i would be jumping to conclusions. also, from your other posts, you seem to have a guilt mentality built in to your consciousness. need to work on that, you need to understand things aren't just earned in the world, some are given. take your parents giving you money to live and get meds. if you had a child that was struggling, would you not do the same. and you probably wouldn't want them to feel an overwhelming guilt about it. what you are thinking is a result of how you were treated, as unimportant, at some point of your life. you then could accept that role if you felt it was right (children don't know any better) and to this day try to recreate that role you are accustomed too. here is one of my favorite songs/poems. its simple but has a wonderful point. i never feel more given to than when you take from me – when you understand the joy i feel giving to you. and you know my giving isn’t done to put you in my debt, but because i want to live the love i feel for you. to receive with grace may be the greatest giving. there’s no way i can separate the two. when you give to me, i give you my receiving. when you take from me, i feel so given to. -song “given to” (1978) by ruth bebermeyer from the album, given to. good luck, homie.",1,0,1,1282063835
t3_d215i,depression,philosarapter,"may i take a guess and say that you were punished unnecessarily as a child? i say this because what you are experiencing is common with children who grew up in abusive homes. see we all learn things by reward and punishment, as we age those things that we were punished for become 'bad' and are avoided, and those that we are rewarded for become 'good'. now once you reach a solidifying age where your personality starts to finish up, you are left with this concept of what 'normal' is. children who grow up with abuse begin to believe that they deserve this punishment and overtime believe that it is normal for them to be punished (even for things like doing nothing, or doing well) if you learned to associate success with punishment, then this could be your root issue. you feel like something is out of place when you succeed, like somethings not right... its not 'right' for you to succeed. so you believe you don't deserve it and that in order to make right with the world you must self-destruct. to overcome these learned patterns of behavior, you have to start taking an effort in rewarding yourself for success. you have to rewire your brain as to what is 'right' and what is 'wrong'. it will take some time but if you are able to control your self-destructive impulses they will fade over time. when you things start going good, you will feel awkward, like you are out of place, but stick it out and keep doing better for yourself anyway. tell yourself that you deserve better, every day. that the only control we have over our situations in life is what we do at this exact moment. the past is gone and has left its mark, there is nothing you can do about that... but you can control where everything goes from here. you can orchestrate the changes you wish to see on the inside and become a better person. promise yourself that you will improve a little bit everyday, think positively, find admirable traits within yourself and give credit where credit is do. you, of all people, deserve your own admiration and respect.",2,0,2,1282064901

t3_d68jw,depression,[deleted],"short answer is a definite yes. it's one of symptoms of depression. also keep in mind depression is not wholly emotional, it's largely physiological and messes with the mechanics of your brain's functions. the reasons though are varied, there are associations with serotonin and memory, but also you have to remember depressed people are stressed out all the time, and often have given up on their problems and let their day to day life skills lax. memory is a process you participate in on a sub-concious level, but it's not an automatic one. you'll naturally think about the thing you're trying to remember and process it, fit it in your schedule and file it away. it's not instantaneous so if you just listen to the thing and continue with other thoughts you will not remember it. my poor memory was basically a clinical condition when i was really depressed, i would tell people i probably wouldn't remember to do things and ask for a call and stuff because i knew my word just wasn't enough. i'd forget very important things that i don't now, usually within half an hour. it got me in a lot of trouble, and it made me feel horrible but i eventually figured out it was a part of my condition. i think a lot of it was just the constant fast pace my mind was going at from the stress, i never gave some time to think about the things i had to remember. when i got medication it took me about a month of not being depressed to restore my mental readiness to stimuli and i have very little memory problems now. which is good, my memory was so bad i thought i actually had a physical disability or a tumor. a link for you:",6,0,6,1282935729

t3_d9rjw,depression,LOLgreat,"i've been there brother. it seems like a dark well where almost no light can reach you. the world is dark on the brightest of days and really nothing seems fun or enjoyable, like you are just existing with no purpose. i had asked myself those same questions. people would miss you whether you think so or not. the pain of your passing would be far worse for them than what you are feeling now. you can't do that to them or do that to yourself. i happen to be 23 as well and interestingly live with my parents too. but few years back i would drive down the road and look at trees or bridge supports and think 'i could just veer off into one of those and it would be all over.' so i know what its like. but i can assure you that as bad as everything seems right now, it will get better. everything changes and it will get better. i promise. you may think that nothing is good in your life right now and you may have some adversity facing you, but there are some good things in your life. it may be hard to see the good as everything else is so dark, but you need to let go of the negative things and begin focusing on the good. i used to say ""i never learned how to talk to girls"" and that was only true because i wanted it to be. not because it actually was. i wanted to put myself in that position so i could wallow in my lonesome. my negative attitude towards myself caused the majority of my issues and when i changed that, the days slowly started to get brighter and life began to get more enjoyable to the point where i was happy. if you have to, get a 'gratitude stone'. its just a small stone, or any small trinket and keep it in your pocket. whenever you reach your hand in and feel it, think of something positive about your life or something that makes you happy. or even get bracelet or something similar like that. just remember that it is there to remind you that you have good in your life and it is never worth it to end it. your life wont change overnight, but if you take it one day at a time, before you know it, the days will be much brighter!",3,0,3,1283667754

(many people, myself included, start flailing while still in uni.) anyway, setting a reasonable goal for yourself is like plopping an island down into that infinite sea. now, you have something to swim toward. for example, i ounce got out a serious mental hole by focusing strictly on buying a motorcycle. (i had sold my previous motorcycles to help finance moving to a different state.) to buy a motorcycle, i had to have money, to have money i had to actually get a job, and hold onto that job, and not spend every cent i made on hookers'n'blow (figuratively speaking). etcetcetc. i actually ended up spending the money i save on an airline ticket to fly to a friend's house, where he just gave me a motorcycle, which i then rode the 800 miles back home. that motorcycle then led me to meeting people and making friends i still have 7 years and two motorcycles later. life is not a straight line. it's a serious of randomly placed stepping stones. sometimes, you have to just make up a stepping stone or two, to get you going. after that, they start appearing on their own. go watch [fight pay attention to the scene in the bathroom where they talk about, ""okay, dad, now what?""",5,0,5,1284357822

t3_ds804,depression,damn_it_so_much,"&gt; well what if im on the verge of tears because of the fucked up shit i have going in my head while were in the middle of a conversation? i cant have that. why? are you afraid you would drive your friends away? i totally get that. depression is basically the feeling that you're a worthless piece of shit. it's natural to want to hide it from others, especially your friends... because if they knew how worthless you were, they'd leave you in the dust, right? i base this on my own past (current?) thoughts and experiences. depression by its very nature drives you to isolate yourself. when i'm in that sort of state it's *very* uncomfortable to be with other people. but in my case, being with other people helps alleviate it. i dunno, maybe it's cause i force myself to put my feelings aside when i'm with people? maybe the social interactions distract me away from the ""fucked up shit going on in my head?"" i don't think you have to worry about crying in front of your friends though... especially since you can't cry when you're by yourself. &gt; i feel like if i told them these things they would turn into my ""suicide watch"" or something, which i would hate... don't tell them about the suicidal thoughts then. maybe limit it to the depression?

t3_dr2mn,depression,Juvia,"getting stuck at point 1 is understandable. if you're an introvert, then approaching people is not as easy as it tends to be for extroverts. the problem is that when you do want to approach someone, you have got to turn your brain off. stop thinking about everything that could go wrong and just do it. the main problem with introverts _(who are having problems with their personality traits)_ is that they think too much about things that could go wrong and the problem is that they don't know if things will go wrong or not, they just _expect_ it. (and then usually things do go south, since they set themselves up on purpose.) there's also a saying that when you look for love, you find no love, but when you do something that you love - you find love. the same thing when it comes to finding friends. this is why getting a hobby or finding something that you are passionate about is so important. to find out what you like, you need to make a list of all the things that makes you happy. for me its simple things like gaming, reading/buying books, listening to music and exercising and so on. my hobby is music, so i practise singing and composing everyday. so if i wanted to meet people i would probably start a band. or i could join a book-club etc. once you've made the list, because you do have things that you like, find out if there are classes of your interest that you can take to meet up with people. this is pretty much one of the only ways you can find people who are like you, by taking classes or courses of personal interest.",0,0,0,1287324947

t3_dto3e,depression,[deleted],"i was in therapy several times from a young age all the way up to 31 (after a 10-year stretch of handling it reasonably well on my own). every therapist was a failure until the last one. but my attitude was different, as was her approach. i wrote down a list of symptoms, the things i was thinking about that hurt so much, and some expectations for improvement. i asked her to help me help myself, and told her that months or years of office visits was not a viable option for me. she seemed somewhat surprised and said that she could help me undo the automatic thinking that was causing all of my problems within a few visits. how many *years* did i waste in therapy, showing up every week with a check, complaining about how the world sucks and how shitty i feel, with the therapist nodding and handing me tissues and asking me how i felt about things or what had happened recently in my life. it was more like a magazine interview with a celebrity than a therapy session, and it never did one tiny bit of healing. all depressed people share the same core problems: 1. they feel that their problems are silly. 2. they feel stupid for being so badly affected by silly problems. 3. they don't want to burden someone else with their stupidity and silly problems, or they don't think that they'll be taken seriously, or they are too embarrassed. item 3 is most prevalent when it gets really bad. depression is an emotional disease; you should no more be ashamed than if you'd been physically injured in any ordinary way. depression removes your ability to feel emotions, and to feel the emotional impact of others. so not only do you end up not caring, but you don't see why anyone else would care either. except the reality is that there are people who do care, and they want to see you get better. they may get frustrated if they don't understand, but they still care.",1,0,1,1287608359

t3_e2crd,depression,TotallyRandomMan,"it is common to try to hide away your flaws and your pain, past and present, from other people... but just remember that anyone worth letting into your life will have an open ear and open mind for your personal stories, will understand and empathize (or at least do their best), and can even offer you insight you may otherwise have missed. if someone doesn't do these things, then they are not really worth letting into your life, so don't fret about them. and to touch on what others here have said, i have come across a number of people with self-scars who are brilliant, hopeful people.. having crossed a chasm of pain and/or numbness that most would be hard-pressed to fathom, and doing their daily best to discover life, joy, and some sense of meaning, even in the face of their own fear and doubt. and yet, some of the others i've met, instead seem hellbent on maintaining their misery at all costs. they often drag down those around them, to instill in themselves a false sense of security. it's infuriating.. but i still feel bad for them, because they're just trying to get by the best they know how, just like anyone else. my point is it's all about attitude. that's really what determines how easy/hard it is to deal with others. you don't have to be an extrovert to have meaningful interaction with people; you just have to want to do it. (that doesn't make it easy if you're shy; i know that very well... but the point still stands.) there's no need to be ashamed of the past. hell, there's no need to be ashamed of shame! it's a totally natural, common feeling. why run from it? get it out there, to those who would listen. at the same time, make sure you keep your ears to those who would tell you *their* story. it's a two way street. and those who don't care to hear your story, are simply not meant to be in your life. it really is that simple. best of luck to you.",2,0,2,1289111075

t3_e5wa1,depression,TogetherAlone,"(for convenience sake i'm going to use male-pronouns for your friend) the biggest thing that helps me is having a friend that is there for me no matter what. even if your friend seems to be pushing you away, unless he's really trying in earnest, he wants you to stay, he just doesn't want to inconvenience you. make sure your friend gets out of the house and does things whenever possible. even if your friend doesn't want to, it will usually be good for him. (obviously be understanding if he's having a particularly bad day, but especially if it's a good day, get him out of the house, even if it's just to go with you to the grocery store/walk your dog/run errands. if you can find a hobby you both can enjoy that would be even better). my therapist had me make a list of things i enjoy doing that i could do instead of cutting myself, and i haven't cut since (it's only been a month, but the instinct seems to be fading). things that belong on that list are just about anything that your friend might think ""i'd rather be doing ___"" (listening to music, playing tennis, going for a drive, etc.) offer to hang out with your friend often, even when he doesn't ""need"" you, he may still be pretty depressed and just be holding out for some time when he'll need you more. the less my friends make time for me regularly, the less comfortable i am asking them for help. your friend will be fine. he's obviously seeking help, and obviously has a friend that cares. those are two key ingredients to recovery.",8,0,8,1289726271

t3_e6qyc,depression,[deleted],"hey, i'm just graduating college this year, and your post sounds like something i would have written 4 years ago. the situation with your friends is something i can relate to. i am just now letting friends of 5 or 6 years see how depressed and insecure i am, and it blows them away, because i was always the lighthearted one. but they stick by me anyway. if they're good enough friends, they love you no matter what. as for the having no right to be miserable, that's patently false. some people are depressed because they've had a hard life. but some people, like myself, are just wired weird. you have every right to feel the way you do. don't think otherwise. your feelings are your own, and they are no better or worse than anyone elses. as for the college fear, pretty much everyone in your shoes has that fear, even if they aren't showing it. its a scary new place, and even if you don't want to stay home moving into the unknown is a scary experience. trust me, every freshman deals with this. when you arrive at your school, talk to your ra. yeah, they're a stranger, but they've spent hours training to deal with fear and homesickness. they can talk to you. i guarantee they'll care, its their job. if you feel you can't talk to your ra, talk to a counselor at your school. again, they deal with this all the time and they do care. as for not ending up alone at college, the cliche advice is true: join clubs, talk to people on your floor, talk to people in your classes. most of your fellow freshman are as alone as you and will want to make friends. take a chance; some of your best friendships may come out of it.",2,0,2,1289879688

t3_e6qyc,depression,oddball01,"thank you for sharing this with us. it takes an amount of courage to click the submit button, and i want to pay my respect to you doing that. you say that fear has dominated your life, but do you mind if i frame it in a different way? it seems to me that these positive steps can be attributed to caring. you sought out help because you care about your mother. you're working hard at school because you care about getting an education and your future. you're avoiding drugs for the same reason. you say that you're scared, but i see a lot of courage in your persistence at school even though it hurts and in your first step of seeking help. you're brave. you imply that other students you know have more of a right than you do to be depressed. i disagree--everyone has a right to their own feelings and no matter how ""insignificant"" your problems are, they're still your problems and you're allowed to feel the way you do about them. yes, they might have a hard life, but that's independent of how you're allowed to feel. i can totally understand how it can be hard to tell your friends, but i just want to point out that they're your friends. they care about you. you wouldn't be wasting their time or bringing them down, but just asking for help (and it's okay to ask for help). isn't that what friends are for? it's okay to be scared about going away to college--nearly everyone is, and it's part of the process to be half-terrified. :) it's a huge transition. i think you've been really brave and strong with everything. especially by seeking help. that is so important. how are the psychiatrist visits going? just wanted to let you know that you're not alone and that a least one random stranger is listening and can relate. i also want you to know that it doesn't have to be like this, that the ""not being depressed"" state is possible.

t3_ebyxc,depression,joesphlabre,"i was fucked up for a long time. tried so many things that did nothing to help. took over 15 different meds - combined or separately. i have addiction issues which made matters that much worse. i'm not saying that you have the same issues as i did with alcohol, but you may want to quit long enough to see if and how much alcohol affects your depression. you don't have be a full blown alcoholic for it to compound your depression. that said, here is how i finally seemed to lick my issues: i quit drinking. this was huge for me. once i got through a period of sobriety, i felt i had the clarity to begin titrating off my psych meds (wellbutrin was one of the worst i took btw..ymmv). once i titrated off my meds, i had a ""clear head"" for the first time in years. at that point i could really feel myself getting better and i was encouraged. once you get this feeling and have the realization that it can better you want to keep building on it. i began exercising again. i was very athletic when i was younger and i picked up sports again as a way of exercising. i started to eat better but i'm far from obsessive about my diet - just changed some little things. i have miserable experiences with individual therapy so i tried group therapy and it has helped me so much. lastly, i simplified my life. i joke about how dumbed down my existence is today but it really helped me focus on getting better and staying sane. i walked away from virtually all forms of unnecessary stress and i only worry about what i can control. i know it sounds so cliche and it's hard for others to accept, but i made the decision to focus on me and getting me better. i walked away from just about everything associated with my past and now have new things to go with and experience in my new life. this is a step many would find too radical. i literally stripped out everything. i'm over a year in and going strong. this is just my story, one of many. good luck to you friend, you deserve to be happy.",2,0,2,1290759721

(licensed clinical social worker) are the people i would advise you to see. if you go to a g.p. they are likely to put you on medication, i believe a counselor would be the best person to determine if you need medication for your depression--not a family doctor. as far as who you tell that is completely up to you. whatever makes you feel comfortable. i am assuming that you do want to talk about it with people. am i right? i believe if you do tell some people about it you will be surprised to see how many people go through the same thing you are going through. it is too bad people don't talk about this topic more. as far as telling workers about it. i believe the only person that you should feel like you need to tell is your boss. and that is only if you feel comfortable doing that. to make it easier, if you do decide to tell your boss, practice what you are going to say, how you are going to say it, and the possible reactions you could receive. you could say something as simple as: ""i am going through some difficult times right now, but i am working through them so i can be a better person and better worker."" congrats on deciding to get help. it is the most difficult step in overcoming depression. you will get through this!",2,0,2,1291227336

t3_eims5,depression,[deleted],"do you have any family member or friend who would be willing to listen to you? sometimes, depression tricks us into thinking nobody cares about our problems, and that it is just us against the world. this is not true. most of the time, we're surrounded by people who honestly care about you and your problems, even if you think they don't. if you're going through this alone, it's definitely not good for you. my recommendation is this: talk it out, just get off your chest. people who know and care about you will have a different outlook in your situation and can give you hope. the exercise, vitamins and better food will work out, just give it a little more time to cause an impact. if you really don't have anyone to talk to, or you just don't feel comfortable doing it with anybody, just remember, you always have reddit just a few clicks away. maybe i'm just speaking for myself, but i feel honored that you're willing to share this with us, and really hope you can find a way out of this.",5,0,5,1291872085

t3_eke65,depression,[deleted],therapy number one. your story warrants medication too which helps a lot too. you are too young to have to live your life being this miserable. i mean there are lots of good ways to help yourself too like writing and reading about help too. the best advice i can give is ask someone who knows how to handle stuff like this. therapists work well because they are trained well and anonymous in your life. they can't hurt your school or work or whatever. therapists tend to enjoy working with people and can be quite personable. they most likely become very enjoyable people to spend time with in therapy if you form a good working relationship. really they help you with a new way of thinking.,2,0,2,1292135131
t3_eke65,depression,match451,"sometimes people don't know why they're depressed, but what i'm hearing from you is a general dissatisfaction with life, finding things monotonous and not getting the same pleasure out of things you used to. you mentioned that you don't do anything besides play video games on weekends, and you sound rather dissatisfied with doing it, so maybe its time to try something new instead of doing the same thing that isn't working? maybe you could try making some plans with friends to do something together, like get a movie, play some card games, get something to eat, or whatever you guys feel like doing. some of my best times i had during high school were just when a couple friends and i hung out, not really doing anything. it does help to talk to someone though, and it sounds like your brother cares about you a lot. why not talk to him? he's not going to care about you any less because you feel depressed.",2,0,2,1292135682

t3_eke65,depression,furless,"certainly, give it a try if that's what you want. sometimes, simply talking about it will help. it sounds like you have been through a lot recently and that can take some time to process -- although after three years maybe another approach will be more effective. as for taking medicine, if you had a persistent infection that were curable through antibiotics i hope you wouldn't feel bad about taking the medication. similarly, depression can be analogous to a brain infection, in that a) these things happen and aren't your fault; and b) medication can bring the problem under control.",2,0,2,1292140817
t3_ejw29,depression,Hippocratic,"i would recommend: you can then look at the visual rep of of sounds over a long period without having to actually listen to it. however with sleep apnea it should become relatively apparent due to loud snoring and frequent pauses in snoring/breathing sounds. you will be able to look at something like this to see all the breathing noises: however you can not really be sure of this method diagnosing sleep apnea, but if it records snoring you should see a sleep clinic. obviously the best option is to go to a sleep lab, what is normally done is they give you a small device you take home with you that you wear and it properly records pulse/oximetry and breathing. you bring that device back to the clinic the next day and if the data on the device shows sleep apnea episodes you will be asked to do a proper sleep test at the lab. on the other hand just for shits and giggles you can do this: what you want to do is get a small mic you can tape under your nose with surgical tape. keeping the mic beside your bed will not record individual breaths (non snoring breaths) as they would be too quiet so its best to tape it above upper lip / under nose. record throughout the night and look at the data in the morning.",1,0,1,1292140818

t3_epljr,depression,[deleted],"if you become employed by a company that offers group health insurance as long as you had coverage within 62 days prior to the day you are eligible to sign up for the insurance then there won't be a pre-existing condition. the waiting period from the time you sign up to when it begins doesn't count for those 62 days. for example say your current coverage ends jan 31, 2011. you get a job in the us april 2, 2011 and you're able to elect your insurance benefits that day but they don't start until the first of the following month (may 1, 2011). you had approximately 61 days without coverage prior to being eligible again. there would be no preexisting clause. say that you change the new job date to may 2, 2011 and you had approximately 92 days without coverage- i am pretty sure that the exclusion time against anything you were treated for within the last x amount of time (determined by your employer/insurance company - say one year for example) would be limited to only the # of days after day 62 of no coverage and the day you were eligible for new coverage. so in this case if you went 31 additional days without coverage that is the most amount of time your new insurance company wouldn't cover treatment for the pre-existing conditions. the 2nd part is what i'm not sure about. it seems to have varied from employer to employer for me. right now im going on 30 days without insurance and hoping to have it again soon! good luck- insurance in the us is a necessary evil!",1,0,1,1293030684

t3_eqpca,depression,lol____wut,"ok so here's the thing. when you're depressed there's a handful of things you can do: - improve your diet - exercise daily - therapy with a professional - medications like ssris - meditation - fix your sleep schedule and that's about it. the important thing though is that you don't just try one of those and then stop. you should be doing most of them. at the same time. if you just improve your diet, you may feel slightly better. but probably not enough to really help your depression. if you work out you'll feel better, but working out alone probably won't be enough either. and taking drugs or therapy alone may make you feel better but you may still be depressed. but these things 'stack'. exercise + good diet + enough sleep + ssri + vit d is what i need to feel 'normal'. if i skip on more than one of those i drop into feeling like shit again. out of those 5 things the most important ones for me is my ssri and exercise. so you have to experiment. work out for 2 weeks, you'll feel a bit better, so keep doing it. next step: fix your sleep schedule. do that for a while until you feel a bit better again. keep doing it. fix your diet. if you run out of stuff to try on your own it's time to see a doctor and get some medication or therapy. good luck.",3,0,3,1293170569

t3_erdc3,depression,sparkie_t,"hey dude, great question. i work with people who have chronic pain problems and often recommend vigorous exercise to help manage their symptoms. the mechanism i'm trying to target is similar to the one you want to target for depression, thats the release of your [happy hormones]( now there is debate about what exercise, how long, how often etc going on in the scientific community. i think (sorry no reference) that the prevailing thought is thats its unique to the individual (bit of a cop out i think). they say that it may be 15mins to 45mins, and at a vigorous pace (60-80% of your maximum). this should be done daily for a cumulative effect. i have also read that endorphins are released as a result of repeated muscle contractions. so lifting is good too. might i suggest alternate lifting and cardio for maximum benefit. also maybe a sport? helps focus your training and get us depressos out socialising, with a little bit of friendly competition.",2,0,2,1293307489

t3_erdc3,depression,Kardlonoc,cardio is good but if you get really into long distance running you feel like you are going to die after a three mile run or so. its definitely exhilarating but very exhaustive. instead strength training i feel is the best. no matter how much you weigh or how little muscle you have it is very easy to get pumped up after lifting a good amount of weight. overtime you will build a superb confidence in yourself and in your muscles. everything about yourself espeically your self worth will increase when you work the muscle. as for the other guys in the lifting room never be intimidated: at one point in their lives they scrawny as well and they always remember it. most of them are in fact as friendly as the come as long you follow the rules but keep in mind that jerks exist everywhere in in the lifting room. but whatever happens don't be ashamed to go there. just go and lift and build. as for what to do in the gym itself just try out a bunch of exercises and do whatever makes you feel best and make that part of your workout whenever those muscles aren't tired. for me the bench press just an awesome exercise even though i suck at it. a good amount of blood rushes to your head and there is a bit of a thrill that comes with it. the act doing stuff with free weights in general is also good. free weights are harder than the plate machines but work out more of the supporting muscle when you use them. but to be more specific squats is the workout you are looking for. doing squats is the primary exercise that releases more hormones or something that basically makes you feel good. i don't know the exact science behind it but squats on the internet are what you need to do to build on everything. also flex after you exercise to really rush the blood to those muscle points. look yourself in the mirror and love yourself and your body. there is nothing wrong with doing this. also taking up a fighting sport helps boost confidence as well. but overall what any sport or exercise imparts to you is to never quite no matter how down you are feeling when you do. there is always tomorrow. lastly there is in fact a pill you can take to help your depression: vitamin d.,2,0,2,1293314368

t3_eu948,depression,worse,are you out of work right now or are you not being productive? i know when i was out of work i felt like total shit. so i gave myself very specific tasks. today i'll write 5 coverletters and try to find 10 more possible applications. breaking down the task of finding a job into subtasks that i could control was key for me to feel like i'd at least accomplished something. what else? i tried to get out of the house. i trawled coffee shops looking for temp work to hold me over until i could get a job i wanted. it'd also give me a place to work for much of the day / a place to awkwardly hit on potential future coworkers. good luck. it sucks to be in a hole.,2,0,2,1293821713
t3_eu948,depression,tiredofallthis,"thank you - i feel less alone now. i'd think of the longterm, but it's all i can do to get through till bedtime. longterm means being like this on and off for the rest of my life, and i so don't want that. i'm not out of work - just the christmas break. but you're right, specific tasks &amp; getting out help. tomorrow ....... thank you for being here &amp; sharing..",2,0,2,1293822185
t3_etxb1,depression,lucky_mud,"i know how you feel, i feel like i should be helping people and a part of me wants to, but i find it almost impossible to care, even about ymself sometimes, and when i do, i feel selfish for not putting others first. i think empathy is something that's difficult to muster when you're struggling with depression. it's never a bad thing to go out and actually do something good, though.",1,0,1,1293831245
