akj8u,depression,SarahC,Tramadol - quick fix major depression fix.,"I don't have an addictive personality, so for the last 2 years I've been supplementing my anti depressants with Tramadol.

Before I was taking it, the depressive episodes were scary - when it's been bad, I get the jumbled thoughts, inability to talk properly, dropped sentences in mid chat, incredibly tired, massive low mood, complete disappearance of any positive emotions. I occasionally look drunk.

But, in the last 28 months I've kept a high stress, fast paced IT job and excelled at it. I've had problems with drive - that's possibly more to do with work taking all my energy. It's been life transforming.

Tramadol works after a few hours and lasts around 12. You can get it online.
It's an analogue of opiates - but with far less side effects, no fuzzy head, dry mouth or anything like that.

The BIG downside is it's addictive. I think it's such a bitch that something that is so useful, and works so well and so fast can be that addictive.
I've kept between 50mg to 300mg for the last two years, usually staying at 150mg day to day.

I wonder if there's any more research going to be done about it's addictiveness?

Has anyone else had any experience with this drug? I'm interested in how useful it is in general.",20,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/akj8u/tramadol_quick_fix_major_depression_fix/,1262360328

al526,depression,unremedied,"Am I depressed? Also, question regarding depression and cognitive functions/emotional health","I have not told any other person about my problems, not even a doctor. I prefer to solve things on my own, but I see now that I am getting nowhere by myself. I think I may be suffering from some sort of depression and social anxiety (just guesswork really, at this point it's all self-diagnosis).
I am also wondering about to what degree depression may affect memory, concentration and emotional health. I've had all of these problems for as long as I can remember (at least since early teens, I am 26 now), so I might have been depressed as long as well.

I have problems concentrating, and it's starting to have detrimental effects on my performance at work and life in general. In fact I don't even rely on sequential thinking when solving problems anymore. I just hold the idea or problem in my mind, and hope something pops up. If nothing does then I'm stuck. I think ""foggy brain"" describes it well.

Also my memory has always (seems like) been poor, I have big problems remembering any facts. Anything that is ""solid"" like names, dates, places, etc just slips away. It feels like I'm having trouble retrieving memories, not storing them though. As if all the memories are trapped in an adjoining room to the retrieval office, and there's a man in the adjoining room yelling the memories through the wall. Some things gets through, the rest are muddled.
I have a good ability to understand and remember complex ideas and systems though, but if asked to explain these in words then I'm at a loss again.

As far as emotional health goes, I seem to have a lack of emotion. I don't get any enjoyment from anything at all. I can't remember the last time I was happy, but I'm not sad either. I don't have any suicidal thoughts, don't cry, etc. And I do have a conscience, I'm not a sociopath. I just feel empty.

So, am I depressed? I'm honestly unsure myself, because of my poor memory I can't remember feeling any other way. 
Also, could the problems described above be caused by depression?

I have tried to do the suggested remedies like exercise, eating healthy, learning an instrument, playing sports, etc. But because I lack enjoyment in anything I do I find it hard to keep at it (although I'm still trying to keep at it).",13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/al526/am_i_depressed_also_question_regarding_depression/,1262551282
ale8v,depression,i_am_ready,Help me find the way forward,"tl;dr:  I'm an irresponsible, depressed, fatalistic father miserable in his current circumstances and unsure how to change them.

I've always struggled with feeling like a failure, and with depression.  I grew up in a traditional nuclear family, where mom took care of the house and bills, and dad took care of handiwork and the cars.  I wasn't very interested in manual labor, and got some pretty harsh criticism from my dad that I still carry with me, even though we're on better terms now.  

After 5 years of college, I got my girlfriend of 6 months pregnant, and dropped out school to get married rather than finish it up.  I managed to get on a HelpDesk for a large company back in '99, and things seemed to be looking up.  We had an apartment, and I was able to support the 3 of us.  I realized quickly that my wife was not the homemaker that I was expecting, and would lie to me rather than start fights with the truth about what she spent money on, or why the money didn't go toward bills.  We had issues keeping a 2 bedroom apartment clean, and bills that should have been easy to cover began going unpaid.  We would talk about these things, but no resolution would ever come of them.  Over the years I've been on and off anti-depressants, but I can't see the good in taking something to go numb when it doesn't change the life that I'm living. 

Fast forward 11 years and 3 more kids.  We now have a perpetually chaotic house that we've gone into bankruptcy to keep, a van that won't run and that I can't afford to get fixed, and this morning I find that the car that I haven't been able to afford to get an oil change for in months won't start due to the cold.  

I realize that I'm reaping the reward of my choices, but I don't know how to make everyone around me happy.  I'm not a happy person by nature, mostly because I brood over all of the mistakes that I've made in the last 11 years that have brought us to this point.  I have no money in the bank, no equity in the house, zero chance of getting credit to fix anything, and a churning stomach.

I'm not trying to avoid blame.  My kids run wild, my house is a disaster, and I don't really even try to make things better.  I'm like a kid stuck waiting for someone to tell me what to do next, and while I don't like living this way, on some level I know that I want to see it all fall around me.  I want to fail.  I hope for a terminal illness or a fatal accident daily, so that it can finally come to an end.  I want to start over, and I know that I can't, but I have no idea how to make it better.",5,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ale8v/help_me_find_the_way_forward/,1262616800
alm54,depression,justbla,I feel so bad about everything these days,"I don't even know where to start.  So much is wrong with my life now, before too.

First of all is the big news I got today.  A girl who I loved the second I saw her 15 years ago killed herself a few days ago.  We hardly spoke and rarely saw each other this last decade, during which I fought depression, then life gave her a big helping of it too.  Too much for her.  For me I don't know, I just keep working now.

I'm in an increasingly loveless relationship with a girl who wants to start a family.  She left a marriage to be with me, now I find myself staying with her just because of that but I'm not happy and she's not stupid, we just don't talk about it.

I hardly talk to my family anymore.  I write them sometimes but I don't have the guts to read their replies.

All I have is my work which I relentlessly pour myself into virtually every waking minute.

I've been battling depression for the last 10 years and for much of that time depression won.  How do I get out of this pit I'm in?  I just want to be happy but I don't know where to go or what to do to achieve that.   Every day I feel myself just fighting off and supressing all the thoughts I have more and more because I know where that leads.

alsov,depression,BillTheRedditor,"Hi Reddit, I'm struggling with admitting I need help.","I'm a 23 year old male who has been suffering from recurring stages of depression and anxiety for almost three years.  Up until recently, Ive been denial about how I felt, and I did everything I could to hide it from those close to me.  I now am considering seeking help, but still find myself struggling with going through with it.  I haven't talked to many people about my experiences, so I greatly appreciate this space for Redditors to talk about depression.

My depression seems to be episodic in nature. I quickly go from a relatively happy and normal state to a deep feeling of self-loathing, which could often persists for days before I feel somewhat normal again.  The states are sometimes triggered by a stressful event, but other times come clear out of the blue.  During them, I feel as though I am completely alone and disconnected from the world, not just in a social sense, but as if I were just watching a movie of my life rather than actually being present in it.  I feel like I succumb to panic attacks, where I suddenly feel a rush of seemingly unprovoked fear and anxiety towards a situation and become petrified by the whole experience.  Most persistently, though,  I seem to shift into periods of intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and animosity directed towards myself.  I sometimes focus this self-directed aggression into suicidal thoughts, but they are somewhat superficial in nature, as I've never truly felt the desire to end my life.   I feel as though I need to punish myself for failing at something or making a misstep in a social relationship of even the smallest degree, and that that the negativity I direct towards myself is just part of that punishment.  When alone, I cry a lot.  When around others, I try to hide how I am feeling by acting happy and smiling.  

Eventually, gradually or rapidly, I feel as though I am returning to normal.  It is this complete feeling of ""normalcy"" that has kept me in denial of my depression.  I would rationalize to myself that, because I no longer felt any feelings of gloom and doom, that there must not be anything wrong.  I tell myself I was just being ""dramatic"", or that stress like that is a regular part of life. I brush off the thoughts of suicide, as I really have no desire to end die.  I again feel as though I like myself, enjoy living and being alive, and am in control of whatever situation is at hand.  I choose to just ignore the whole event and move on like nothing happened.   But after almost 3 years of going through these unpredictable ups and downs, I've come to realize that the almost unbearable intensity and frequency of these experiences, warranted or not,  is not healthy.  I also feel as if I am allowing them to happen more and more frequently, and that they do not seem to be going away by ignoring them.

Which brings me to my current situation:  I am again in one of my normal periods, and feel relatively happy and stable.  Not but two days ago, however, I went through another phase of panic attacks and depression, and during this time I finally opened up to my family about it.  They suggested I make an appointment with my doctor to get a referral to a counselor or psychologist/psychiatrist.  Feeling like I had hit some sort of emotional ""rock-bottom"", and finally wanting to admit that I was suffering, I agreed to make the appointment, and to start seeking help for my condition.  The problem is, now that I again feel normal, I feel like I don't need any sort of counseling or treatment for my condition.  The machismo attitude of ""tough it out, be a man"" has again taken its place in my consciousness.  I am embarrassed to tell my doctor, whom I've known for years,  that I am depressed.  I feel like going to therapy would be too much of a hassle, and that because all the things necessary for a happiness are around me, I have no real reason to feel depressed, so my feelings cant be legitimate.  I haven't lost my house or my job, I have good friends and a kind family, I have a girlfriend whom I love and care for very deeply, what would I possibly talk to a counselor about?  I tell myself I'm just whining needlessly, and that others have it a lot worse, so I should just shut up about it all.  I fear that I'm just trying to retreat into denial again, so I've come here in hopes of getting an outside perspective.

Have any of you been through or know someone who has been through the kinds of experiences I describe?  If so, did anything help them recover?  Do I need to seek treatment for this, or should I try to get over it on my own? What kind of treatment do you think a doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist would recommend for my condition?  I'm a bit resistant to the idea of taking medication to help with my condition, should I be?  If I did start taking medication, would I have to take it indefinitely?

Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have.

alu02,depression,mommyneedshelp,I need help,"I don't know where to begin.  I've never posted online regarding my depression, and generally I'm one who does not tend to reach out for help.  I am a mom of two beautiful little girls (4 and 6 yrs old) and married to a good man.  I've got everything I need, a place to live, food, money for my kids to have educational toys and be able to take them places and do activities with them, friends, well if i'd let them.  But i had a terrible childhood, and i can't get away from it.  I have no family, except my younger brother... who's kinda aloof and closed off.  I feel like my husband is tired to listening to me, and I need to fix things, for my children.  

I feel suicidal, but its not the first time.  Sometimes I'm driving along the highway, and I wonder what it would be like to careen of the side at full speed.  Sometimes I think about grabbing a bottle of pills and chugging it down.  Why?  

My parents abandoned me, many times.  I know, like once wasn't enough, they thought they'd come back and do it over and over again.  I swore I would never ever cause my children the pain they caused me.  But lately, I'm just so so far from being myself.  I am tired all the time, I have no energy, I sleep alot.  Im not being a good mom, but I don't have the energy to keep up with them lately.  I'm in a bad mood, I'm cranky, I'm emotional (cry at the drop of a hat), I stopped going out with friends, I spend all my time at home, probably doesn't help that i'm a stay at home mom.  I feel like life is slipping away from me, and i'm not accomplishing anything.  I feel like my husband is not here for me (we have issues, mostly sex, he never wants to have any, and it has caused my self esteem to drop to the floor).  I'm an amazing cook, the one that makes me feel really good about myself, and lately I don't even want to be in the kitchen.

I don't want to live anymore, and the only thing holding me back is my girls, the thought of leaving them alone is way more unbearable than any pain i could ever feel.  But what good is it to be here for them, if I can't give them a happy mom that can play with them and not feel so horrible all the time?  I've been taking an antidepressant (lexapro) for a year now, and I hate it.  It makes me feel cut off from the world, like I can't feel.  My husbands grandmother died and I couldn't care less, and thats just not me, thats the meds.  I tried to stop taking them, but i went through awful withdrawals and started taking them again.  I'm embarassed to talk to my doctor, I don't like feeling vulnerable so I can't talk to my friends, my husband treats me like ""yeah, yeah, yeah, you say this stuff all the time"".

amt2d,depression,fastdownwardspiral,Can't afford medication and going downhill fast. Tell me about buying prescription drugs online.," I was diagnosed with major depressive and generalized anxiety disorder several years ago. Like many people with depression I was prescribed a variety of antidepressants until finding something that worked for me. I’ve been taking Lexapro (20Mg) and  Seroquel (10Mg) since about mid 2005 and have found that particular combination worked wonders for me. 

 In late September of 2009 I lost my job and medical coverage. I’ve since found a new job but the employer does not offer insurance. Not being able to afford the doctor visits or prescriptions I had to gradually cut back on my meds until they completely ran out a couple of month’s ago. I’ve since been feeling myself spiral out of control. Invasive negative thoughts, obsessing about suicide and death, severe anxiety attacks in public and become withdrawn and unable to relate to anyone. Not to mention the withdrawal was fucking hell. I’m fucking miserable. I forgot how bad this used to be until it all gradually came creeping back in. The medications definitely helped and I feel without them, It’s not a matter of if I might hurt myself, but when.

 I’ve been researching buying drugs online but cant seem to find any information thats not vague or completely sketchy. Does anyone have any experience buying prescription drugs online without a prescription? Any reputable websites that aren’t going to rip me off?  If it matters I live in Ohio.

So here is my question.  I like having no libido.  It means I can concentrate on my work, my child and doing the things I like to do, and not think about sex all the time.  But it's not good for my body: symptoms include itchy skin, weak bones, low energy, thinning hair, joint pain, depression, anxiety among others.

I am 19, I go to a community college. When I was in middle school, I applied to a magnet school (IB) even though my parents didn't want me to because they said it was too far away. I applied anyway, got accepted, and went anyway after finding out the state provided free bus transportation.

I met some cool people, but...I never really became friends with any of them, just colleagues I guess. I was set on doing something in the sciences or maths because that's what my parents have always wanted, a male child who is either a doctor, engineer, or architect. At first I liked those subjects, but as my parents, the state, and people around me kept shoving STEM down my throat I started to resent it. 

I would escape to my drawings, and come up with crazy stories for myself and just isolate myself in order to get away from everything since I had no outlet other than a gamecube (which got boring).

Senior year came, I applied to the state unis, got accepted, but I couldn't afford any of them even with Pell Grant and Bright Future Scholarship. I could afford the commuter state school uni which is where my sister went (housing with parents), but...I changed my mind on what I wanted to do.

I kept reading everywhere that I should ask myself, ""where do you want to be 10 years"", the answer was animating. That's what I did. I applied to the local CC and bought books on animation, on art fundamentals, color theory, looked at tutorials online, gathered soundbites, joined forums and started to go at it. 

I was having a lot of fun, for it's exciting to see the story you came up with, seeing those lines, just come to life after pouring hours into it. I was also drawing, and painting, and still am.

I don't have anyone to share these things with though. It's fun and I show them to my parents but they look more disappointed than anything. Which I guess I understand since my parents are not rich by any means. They immigrated here about 20 years ago and have been working multiple shifts and late nights in manual labor to give my sister and I a roof over our heads, food, and small luxuries.

I just feel horrible doing what I'm doing. This is something that I've always felt with my parents, just huge guilt. Whether it was because I went to a friend's house one Saturday to build a computer, or told them I was going out to buy a book at the mall. It was always this stigma of being a thug of the streets; ""un vago maliante"".

I used to be really good with just looking ahead and just ""keep doing what I'm doing"", but it's not working. In high school I had at least some human contact because we were forced to sit next to each other in class.

I now just lock myself in my room, draw, read up on painting, and occasionally check out reddit and the old facebook to see how much fun those kids who went to unis are having.

Like I said, I used to be good at just ignoring it all and focusing on what I was doing. It gets really lonely though and it really sucked when my dog died last year because she was the only pal I had.

I do volunteer, I actually helped out in a couple of festivals, I also do exercise because I heard it's good for you all around, and I tried to start an animation club myself at the CC, but that failed. I don't have a job, but have been looking. Even that though my parents object to, they rationalize that I'm going to get stuck doing that same job for the rest of my life and want better for me than that because, they truly have sacrificed a lot.

I just want some advice, some words of wisdom from anyone because I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I tried out OkCupid looking for friends, but gave up because it's worse than real life. Speaking of which, I've never had a gf, much less a kiss, nor even a ""best friend"" in my whole entire life. I'm also not that repulsive...5'6"" 140lbs, not incredibly boring.

I've also been thinking of just becoming and engineer or something. I don't like it and I hate the idea of it, and even now as I take my physics w/calc class, I just start sketching all over the margins. 

Also...if it weren't for music, I probably wouldn't have made it as ""far"" as I have. I probably sound cheery, but I'm at a high I guess right now. It gets bad to the point where my stomach starts hurting when I realize what an isolated person I am.


TL;DR

I'm 19, live with my parents, don't have a job, never had a gf nor a real friend in my life. I gave up multiple acceptances to state unis to follow my pipe-dream of animation at a CC. I have no friends, I just draw and paint all day with extreme guilt because my parents would very much rather have me in a STEM job. Although that keeps me busy, at the end of the day, not having anyone to talk to or share this with sucks.

I'm 19 and have never been very good at talking or socializing in general. I mean i haven't really made a new friend since the 6th grade, and they were at a christian school and they honestly just said, ""Hey guys, this is the new kid, we should be friends with him."" After that i just met up with old friends from grade school. Anyways, I'm extremely socially akward. I just don't know what to say almost always. Like I can't be funny or even comfortable. It seems like people are always uncomfortable around me, but i guess they are just reciprocating my feelings? I've been smoking weed for almost 4 years now and lately i spend all my money on it. It doesn't really help. I just get paranoid and get extremely self conscious. It's helped me meet people, which i think is a good thing, but spending all my money on it and smoking every night seems excessive. Maybe that's just me being raised in a conservative home. I mean my parents obviously hate marijuana. Well that seems to be the one thing I'm in control of in my life right now. I've gone to see a counselor and I've lied to him about my marijuana use. My parents see weed as the problem. The real problem is me just being so damn uncomfortable around people. So lacking in self confidence. I see all these happy people around and i want what they have. I just keep asking myself why cant i be like that. I see pretty girls and i want to be around them and talk to them and all that but i just don't know how... I just feel like i cant ""practice"" talking to people because I'm expected to know how to just ""be myself"" and socialize etc. I'm on wellbutrin but it doesn't really help.

arcq6,depression,underafalsename,What's the way out?,"Back in high school, I was on medication, nothing hardcore, and I don't remember what it was called. 

What the doctor said at the time, was that my levels of some chemicals (serotonin?) were lower than average, diet was pretty healthy at that time though.

At 18, I left home, and I went off the medication, because I regarded relying on it as weak, and have been off it ever since. I always had an independent streak, and basically went my own way (skipped university up until 2005, did half of my degree part time on my own dime). Thankfully, the IT industry arrived just in time so that I could work in my hobby, and didn't end up being a bum on the streets. Did a fair amount of chemicals up until 21 though.

At 22, I decided to emigrate to New Zealand, at which time I pretty much stopped everything except drinking, and stayed clean up until now (age 29), to make sure I could get residence/citizenship.

I kind of replaced substance abuse with WoW addiction for almost four years (2005 till late 2009). Things were going well, I was happy, reasonably. My career did quite well, worked my way up from pretty much exactly par with GDP, to the top 3% bracket. 

It feels like I have hit a glass ceiling of sorts though, at work, and in life, and I'm at a loss as to how to get out of it.

I'm an introvert by nature, and emigration didn't help on the friend front - I have made just 2 friends since moving here, despite living here for 9 years now. I've lost touch with all my friends from the old country.

I'm not anti-social, I like hanging out with people I like, I'm just shy as all fuck, I don't get comfortable to the extent I can start taking the piss out of people, and have a good, fun, non-serious conversation until I know someone quite well. My response has been to closet up and limit my exposure.

As you can imagine, being Mr. Serious doesn't exactly make people enjoy my company either, especially with the opposite sex. Thing is, that totally isn't the sum of me, I just have a fucked sense of humor that I don't feel comfortable showing until people are cool with it.

I have no friends I can count on if shit gets really fucked.

Basically - I don't know where my life is going, I keep feeling ""is this it"", and the old suicidal thoughts are rolling back in. Most of my friends back home are married, have bought homes, you know the whole deal.

Here I sit with 9 years spent here, nothing to show for it, just an overpriced car, geek toys, and lots of debt.

My girlfriend of 7 years, bless her, is understandably wondering where things are going with us. Adding to the stress is the fact that her parents are extremely conservative Asians (I am European). I kind of feel like I'm not going to measure up to their standards, not having a degree, and coming from a very poor background.

I still harbor some resentment towards my parents as well, for paying for my older brother's university studies despite being as poor as we were, whereas I've been grafting my whole life since leaving home, and now there's no money for me to study (they must have thought ""he'll be alright""). . But I really resent it a lot, it's stupid and selfish I know. I just begrudge it because he's doing absolutely nothing with his degree.

Sometimes it just gets tiring swimming uphill all the fucking time.

I know I have no right to complain, there are many people out there in a much more dire situation.

But I really have difficulty finding any enjoyment in life whatsoever. Me and my partner went on a road-trip recently, and despite driving through what most people would regard as awe-inspiring scenery, I took a couple of snaps and just sped on. I sit inside 95% of the time that I'm home, and the rest of the time I'm at work, when I'm not working weekends.

I used to love tech, but I just want to switch off when I get home, and veg out, watch TV, or drink. Escapism essentially. I know I should try and finish my degree, but I can't see how I can take the amount of time that I need off to give it the attention it deserves. I know that if I can find the willpower from somewhere, I'll absolutely nail it, I had a 4.0 GPA until I started playing WoW.
But I have no willpower. I find it extremely hard to follow through, whereas in my early 20s I was turbocharged (positive reinforcement maybe), and the lack of follow-through on anything is a negative spiral.


I have this debt hanging over me, which I've had for over 3 years now, essentially putting my life in hold becuase it just doesn't decrease in size. So no house, no travels. Basically I'm a wage slave. I couldn't survive one month without a paycheck, with my obligations.

I've contemplated suicide a couple of times, recently, for the first time in years.

Basically I'm a mess and I've no idea what to do. I know I have to get out of debt, but I'm absolutely terrible at doing so, I'm a real impulse buyer. 

Everyone who knows me thinks I'm this real motivated, hardworking successful guy, but it's all a big fucking lie :(

All my old friends are off working at Google or the next hot start-up, and I feel like an absolute failure doing this middle-of-the-road work at an anonymous company while they're out there living their dreams.

How do I get to being the optimistic happy guy I used to be? I feel one-dimensional and worthless now :(

I've come to the realization that I may be severely depressed. I was sure I was just in a funk until everything I enjoyed was no longer fun, and now I'm starting to think it's depression.

After getting out of college about a year ago, I've been without a real full time job. I've been doing random programming, writing, and graphics design jobs to stay afloat. But, living and working from home sucks--I haven't interacted with anyone but my girlfriend for some time. My days are pretty much all the same. Sleeping pattern isn't a pattern at all--some days I'll get twelve hours, some days four. Appetite is nonexistent unless I smoke some herb. I've felt so off over the last week I can barely hold a thought in my head without my mind racing elsewhere.

I gotta admit, I've never had high self-esteem, but before this came about, I was pretty happy. I'd like nothing more than to feel happy again, but it's just not happening.

Many here have dealt with depression. How did you do it? Am I even depressed at all? I'm feeling desperate, any advice at all would be helpful.

at0ba,depression,20100122,Anything I can do he can do better,"Hey reddit,

I am 19. I have a huge inferiority complex with my bf. In mid-August, I moved halfway across the country in with him, and I have yet to find a job. My parents have been sending me money every so often for necessary things.

Meanwhile my bf, who is 20 and a programmer, landed a 45k/yr job in December without having a college degree. Prior to that, he had a 30k/yr job in tech support which he got when he was 18.

He's had at least three job offers since taking his new job. I have had one phone interview in the last five months, but it ended after two minutes because of my age. I've applied for at least twenty or thirty jobs, and nothing. I'm qualified for all of them, but it just doesn't look like it on my resume. (Also, bf thinks I suffer from Dunning-Kruger effect.) Just today he told me he has another job lead and I got so frustrated that I exited out of gmail. I almost want to tell him to not tell me about these things but then I'd have to explain why, and it's awfully degrading to talk about how I [haven't been able] get a job for five months.

We live with his mom, and his mom has said that it seems like everything's about him. He always talks about his job and she says he isn't very helpful in my job search. I don't even like talking about finding a job with him because it feels so degrading. She is trying to help me find a job and has been wonderful in that aspect, but I feel like it's hopeless.

I am also trying to get into school because it feels like I have no choice, but I also like school and learning. Yesterday I applied for summer classes at community college for the cost. When I looked at my bank account, I was $.46 short of the application fee. My bf transferred $5 to my account just so that I could pay fucking $40. I also plan to apply for university, but I will have to ask my parents for money for the application fee for that too, plus money for sending my ACT scores to the schools. I feel ridiculous because I'm trying to change my life around by applying for school, but I can't even pay a measly $40 fee.

Bf plans to save up enough money for college so that he doesn't have to take out loans. (he's terribly afraid of debt and isn't in any and never has been.) I, however, will be in debt for the next five or six years because I'll have to take out loans. My FAFSA EFC last year was $7700, so there's no way I'd get Pell grants even though my parents will not pay for my college, nor would I want them to. I am trying to get scholarships but who knows if I'll get any. It just sucks that he's able to do that and I'm not.

I know that all my shit isn't his fault or his problem, but it is terribly frustrating and depressing. I have cried every day this week. Maybe I'm just pmsing, I don't know, but it still sucks. I don't know what I'm asking for, but I hate life.

tl;dr: I'm 19, bf is 20, I've been unemployed for five months, he just got a 45k/yr job, I have no money for school, basically he is better than me in all aspects of life and this frustrates me even though I know none of this is his fault.",11,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/at0ba/anything_i_can_do_he_can_do_better/,1264193995

ay63c,depression,cracked22,How I manage my depression,"long time reader, first time poster to /r/depression.

Have been depressed for approximately 20 years, diagnosed for about 6, medicated and with therapist for those same 6. Take Celexa 20mg daily, see a therapist for CBT once a month.

What I want to share with others comes from an article in Psychology Today about 6 or 6 months ago about living in the now.

An example that I'd like to share is when I come home from a crap day at a tough job to a wife that is pregnant with twins (very exciting and stressful at the same time) who also isn't working due to pregnancy complications, housework to be done (laundry, cleaning etc) cooking, and other assorted fun chores, and walking the dog.

I've chosen to enjoy walking the dog. I found a great little wilderness area near where I live, where our dog can run off leash in the woods, smelling anything he wants. Very few people use this area, so no worries about running into someone else with a dog or any type of confrontation.

The bit about living in the moment. There are times when Shadow (the dog) is running around just being happy to be running around. It's then that I try to forget about everything that happened that day, and everything that is to come, and just enjoy Shadow being happy. The air is crisp, the noise of the city are drowned out, there is a peace in the solitude. I watch my dog being happy, and it makes me happy.

I come home after 30 or 60 minutes, refreshed and better able to manage myself and my reactions to the stresses that normal life delivers.

I know not all will be able to find the same type of relief or enjoyment, but I hope that at least one person can read this and try to find one thing each day to enjoy and live in that moment.",7,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ay63c/how_i_manage_my_depression/,1265318698

ayrf3,depression,WhyDoITryAndTry,thanks for reading if you do.,"i dont know why my life seems so shitty. i don't even really know what to write. there's no reason i should be this depressed day in and day out. for fucks sake, i just got back from a weeklong vacation and found out i got accepted to the college i really wanted to go to. i go to school every fucking day with a contempt of 98% of the student populace, just waiting for the end of the day so i don't have to be around these fucking people anymore. and the 2% that i don't have a constant hatred for really only know the facade i put on every miserable day. i pretend to be the funny guy in every situation so i can hopefully ignore my own miserable self for a short while. i get home every day and sit my worthless self in front of a computer and don't actually stop until i absolutely need to sleep. because of this, my grades in school get worse and worse, (i was legitimately surprised to get accepted to college even) i get yelled at by my parents for this, which leads me to hate this fucking place all the more and spend more and more time on this fucking thing. and goddamned relationships. i know i don't need someone to validate my existence, and that having someone doesn't mean that i'll be magically happy or have someone listen to all of my problems, but it seems every fucking time i turn around someone has someone else. or i'll find a girl attractive, and have every intention of asking her out, but every fucking time i just get up enough fucking courage to do it, someone beat me, or i get the ""you're too good of a friend to do that, blah blah"", or i just get flat-out fucking rejected. over the past few weeks, i've been talking to a particular female i've liked for a year-and-a-half to two years now. i would always just about get to asking her out, and i find out that i got beat once again. we were having a conversation via text message a few weeks ago, and i said that it's easier to say things to someone when it's not face-to-face communication, and we started telling each other things we never would in person. i eventually told her essentially that i've liked her for 1.5-2 years, and she said she's gotten close to me in the past year or so and that if she wasn't dating her current boyfriend, she'd be dating me. i know in the back of my head that nothing is going to come of this, but i delude myself everytime we communicate. just tonight, i went to a movie in a group that included aformentioned female, and we sat next to each other. the entire time we were there, i wanted to put my arm around her like in every cheesy anything that takes place in a movie theater. i didn't though because of the obvious her having a boyfriend thing. i'm just fucking rambling about nonsense now. i need to sleep. to awake to yet another perfectly shitty day in which i have to pretend constantly that i'm not a miserable fuck on the inside, and which i'll probably continue to delude myself about me and aformentioned female. 

**tl;dr** i'm fucking miserable and deluding myself about a relationship that at the present time cannot happen.",6,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ayrf3/thanks_for_reading_if_you_do/,1265444402

ayyhy,depression,inneedofhelphere,Been in a bad slump for over a year now.,"I'll make this as quick as possible. I know I'll probably end up like a selfish prick here, but I really have to tell someone.

After growing up in Georgia, I was told that my dad had been transfered and we had to move as I was entering 11th grade. Fine, no problem. I ended up in Wisconsin. It was tough, but I made some friends and by February I was back to playing football and bullshitting around just like the good ol' days in Georgia. Everything was going great. Then, my dad was transferred again. I found out a few days before summer vacation. My parents gave me two options. I could live with my mom for a year to finish high school in Wisconsin, or I could move to Ohio and they'd get me a car so I could fit into there easier as a senior. I decided to move and get the car, as I'd only lived in WI for a year, and didn't really have anyone that I considered a dear friend or whatever. And this is where I am now, in the worst depression of my life.

Literally two weeks after I move in, the economy goes to hell. Poof there goes the car. To make matters worse, where I live is in kind of bad shape to begin with, so no bussing. Fine, I walk the mile to school every day (except during the extremely bad snow storms and rain). In my entire year of schooling, I literally made no friends, not one. I ended up not doing any of the end of the year senior things, nor did I walk with my class. But I'm done, high school is over, I can finally move on with my life. 

Here's the problem, though: money. I need it for college. Unfortuently, where I live right now the only time teens get jobs is if their family knows the owner's family or whatever. I've spent the last 10 months looking for some kind of job so I could get money, get a car, and somehow get my life together, but I just fucking can't. The only jobs that I see myself getting are 15+ miles away, which I'm never going to be able to bike to.

I try telling my parents this, but they just say things like ""We didn't actually promise you a car,"" or ""It's not out fault the economy went to hell"". It always ends up into a screaming match.

So here I am. 19 years old. I have no money. 350 miles from my nearest friends. No chance of me getting into college without money. No motorized form of transportation. And I can't find a job.

I'm so fucking miserable. I can't even take it anymore. I know I come off selfish, but I just can't help it. I've never been this lonely in my entire life.",37,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ayyhy/been_in_a_bad_slump_for_over_a_year_now/,1265498277

b1jta,depression,[deleted],What a disappointment I have become,"I think this will be one of the most heartfelt letters I will ever write.  Who I am writing it to, I have no idea, but I have to write it now.
I know I have created most of my own problems.

I know that I have created this monstrosity that surrounds and suffocates my soul.  This monstrosity that I spend hours of every day focusing on and trying to break out of.  

It is a prison that I unknowingly created for myself.  Back when I did not care about the consequences of my actions, when I did not care about karma or self-destruction.

The whole time that I was drowning in my sorrows, I did not realize that I was drowning myself.

Now it has been 3 years of pure hell, and before that I have always been struggling.  But the past 3 years have been pure, utter, unadulterated hell.

Hardly any income, hardly any productivity.  I get a few moments of relief, followed by misery.  The misery and sadness is the worst part.  I know other depressed people can relate to it.  It’s like there is a black hole where your heart should be, and it continually sucks every atom of hope and happiness from you.  

As soon as I am happy or hopeful for a second, the black hole comes back to do its job and snatch it right from me.

I know the 12 year old me would be disappointed in what I have become.  I had the highest aspirations and I have failed to achieve them. I have become a joke and a disgrace to all of the people who rooted against me and wanted me to fail.  So far, they have won in their desires.

Why do I deserve this?  I don’t think I hurt anyone enough to warrant this punishment.  I try to understand who I tortured for years and I can’t imagine who it was.  I am not a good person, but this punishment is honestly worse than what the Devil himself deserves.

I can’t take my life, but I know I can’t take my life.  I can’t do it because I don’t believe in it, so I sit around and endlessly wait.  I have nothing but an ounce of hope in me that comes and goes, and I just wait to be freed from this daily torture. 

 I know that I will receive ridicule and cynical comments from trolls, but I have to put this up just for me to know that I was at this point in my life after all the effort I have put toward fighting my depression.

b2k61,depression,[deleted],Depression vs. bipolar,"Hi /r/depression,
Recent events have raised questions in my mind as to whether my mental diagnosis is complete. Specifically, I've been formally diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in the past. I'm trying to separate personality components from bipolar symptoms, and am probably not qualified to do it.

I've known my whole life I had some form of depression. It runs all throughout my mom's side of the family. Both of my sisters have some sort of depression. When I was very young, I scored the absolute lowest possible on a test of risk-taking, meaning I was extremely risk averse. I had self-esteem issues throughout school and had my first major depressive episode when I was 16 due to the toxic high school environment, and my ignorance of social norms. Episodes two and three came during college and post-college, and were always characterized by a near complete mental breakdown. The most recent one had a very minor auditory hallucination experience, of which I got so worried I immediately contacted my psychiatrist. I have been on almost every SSRI with limited success, and am on Wellbutrin XL currently. Despite my depression, I remain extremely driven and headstrong, and am a ruthless perfectionist with myself.

I hate self-diagnosing, but a good friend of mine was discussing her recent bipolar diagnosis, and it concerned me. Wikipedia's list of hypomania symptoms is, well, a bit close to what I can experience from time to time. Generally, any time I start a new project at home or work, my view of the world drastically improves. Very few things can move me to this extent. Not only does it evict depression, but I get so excited over it I sometimes have trouble sleeping, often preoccupied with the future direction of the project, and getting very ahead of myself. It is as if I become obsessed with the concept of *epic* and propagating it (I apologize for tripping an Internet meme alarm, but it really fits the idea). I mostly function normally otherwise. As expected, this high does not last longer than a week or two. Then, I return to a fairly volatile set of moods, and eventually seek out another high. This bothers me because I always chalked this behavior up to being passionate about the things I do, and being sensitive about it. Because most people are not as sensitive, I tend to regard them as having very little emotional depth to their emotions (this isn't a good belief to hold). In actuality, they do not wear them on their sleeve, and aren't held hostage by them, like I am.

I become depressed if I am not allowed to be adequately creative. My free time is spent entirely on creative outlets of music and programming. I have difficulty relaxing in my free time because of the goals I want to achieve in both of those areas. The continual good and bad stress wears on my body. I fear falling in love the most, but not just because of the vulnerability. The emotion overwhelms absolutely everything and is nearly debilitating. I avoid it out of self-preservation.

Does anyone have any experience with navigating the differences between depression and bipolar? I know not to seek medical advice from strangers, but I am interested in the experience of others. I will be restarting therapy ASAP.",14,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b2k61/depression_vs_bipolar/,1266300376

b38kk,depression,kurtgodelisdead,Not as depressed.. just wanting some general advice for next time around.,"So I've diagnosed myself with social anxiety disorder for some time now. I plan on getting help to confirm this, but every description I've read seems to describe my personality very acurately. Let's just assume for sake of conversation that this is the case.

One thing that I'm sure others with SAD know about is the feeling of embarrassment when they make a mistake in front of others. It's deblitating to say the least. No motivation to be productive. You just want to give up and be left alone.. It's caused me to drop a couple of my classes. I really don't want to drop another class and most likely I'll do fine for the ones I'm in now.

I've gotten good at assessing myself and knowing that the signals my brain is sending me are mostly false positives. But when those moments strike, there seems to still be a general feeling that something is not right.. Like there's still some ""depression"" chemical swirling around in my brain, causing emotional disturbance.

I want to prevent this depression chemical from taking hold of my brain while I stay productive. I refuse to call it a feeling because that gives it privilege to become real and I'm not going to give it that privilege.

How do people ""wash"" this chemical out of their brains, so to speak? I'm fairly busy these days so I can't just take a day off or anything. Something that takes a couple of hours that I can do between classes would be worth it. I'd like to stick to the steady regimen that I have for myself..

b3ig2,depression,[deleted],Just another one who wants to share his story.,"I wanted to post..because well I'm lonely.  I don't really have any outlet to talk about depression.  it sucks.  right now, I just switched.  Like I just dwell in the feeling of just picking a vein and letting the blood flow.  I mean it's all in my head.  But it's just relaxing when I fantasize about this.  Just letting all my worries bleed out.  And like the trigger tonight was looking at a facebook page of an old friend.  I saw pictures of him just hanging out with other high school people.  I never think of them, but it just hit me and made me feel lonely.  I'm sure it's due to the fact that my own circle of friends from high school, well, I'm not really close to them.  I still hang out with them, but I feel nothing with them.  And it just hit me (the depression) why don't I have friends like that now?
I just want to vent, I'm sorry.
The reason, I don't want to make friends.  I don't want to put the effort forth.  For me, to be social is to work at it.  It's not easy.  I have to put on a show.  And you know this is only when I'm down.  I mean just before I hit his page I was pretty happy.  I'm pretty sure I got a 100 on my calc test yesterday, my professor just emailed the key today to check.  I just finished my crit thinking final today and am fairly confident I'm going to get an A in the class now.  But it's just..it boggles my mind, how everything just switches.  And right now just writing, I don't feel so bad anymore.  And I read the first few sentences and it's awkward.  I feel nothing for it.  I know I felt it, but I feel nothing from it.  Why?  I know I was just happy, but I don't care anymore.
It's to the point that I can't trust my own feelings.  And it's hard to know what to believe anymore.  When I found out my wife was cheating on me.  I felt dead.  But I was able to rationalize what happened, how I need to act, and to be wary of my emotions.  Of course I wanted to destroy her.  And then what, I asked myself to keep me in check.  I did this, because when my ex left me in highschool (I was a total asshole), I let my own emotions control me.  I was destroying myself.  I didn't drink or do any drugs.  But my mind was just killing me.  I pretty much holed myself up in my room for about two weeks.  Food tasted like crap.  I had to force myself to eat.  I barely slept if at all.  I just couldn't stop thinking.  I couldn't turn it off.  I would run down the hill from my house and sprint up as fast as I could.  I was defective.  It took about two years to completely get over her.  This was without communicating with her at all.  From the break up to when I finally wrote a letter saying how everyday I wish I could blow my brains out for everything I did to her and how sick and depressed I am.  I wrote a lot trying to explain my guilt over her and my depression.  She never responded.  And I was finally able to begin my closure over her.  I tried really hard not to blame my assholeish actions on my depressions, but I'm sure writing about both in a letter is sure to confuse.  I felt after the letter I did everything in my reasonable power to communicate with her, she did not want to see me in person.  So I left a letter at her house.  The thing that eats me up the most, is the what if.  So this really helped me.  I was able to walk away, knowing I did my best to communicate in person and to salvage whatever relationship (no as lovers) that was available.  A few years later I see her and a friend (for another friend's birthday).  My ex was drunk and she said something like that letter you wrote, I really hated it.  Her friend stopped her from saying more.  I couldn't have cared less.  I did a little I guess.. But her comment, confirmed my reasoning to get over her.  That she didn't care about me anymore.  And it was a waste of energy to worry about her or worried that I made her depressed too or whatever.  It was clear to me that I did not exist to her anymore.  And it's so much easier to move on after knowing that.  I wrote that letter in one of my darkest depressions.    You know that scene in Dirty Filthy Love, where the guy goes to his ex-wifes party trying to speak with her?  And the ex is just yelling at him to leave.  And his friend comes in, trying to save him, saying ""He only wanted to talk with you.  Why couldn't you just talk with him??""  And it brought back so many feelings when I was writing that letter.  I just wanted to talk..I'm sorry I was an asshole..for two years..

I've been trying to rationalize my behavior since then.  I try to picture my life on a movie screen, and how I (the audience) would critisize the movie-me.  Only a loser would do that.  It helps keeps things in perspective.  For the longest time I tried to relish in my feelings, good and bad (mostly bad, or maybe not I can't tell anymore..), that's what makes us human right?  It took me years and years to finally admit that perhaps something was wrong with me.  The navy has these commercials, well the military does, on AFN (armed forces network) that are like psa type commercials about depression.  There were cardboard cutouts of people just standing in a room.  And some guy is just walking between them like they don't matter.  That he's so out of place that even in a room full of friends he feels they're all strangers, because well they don't know him.  So the last sentence was what was going through my head, because in the Navy I felt that a lot.  I was in for 6.  Since getting out I'm still sorting through my life and feelings.  Though my moods have stabilized a lot, the more aware I am of my moods and potential triggers..  When it does hit..man I'm just so sick of it.   I want to be like Plath, taking those sleeping pills one by one.  Feeling the life drift away from me.  Or like Wurtzel, taking those atarax pills one by one..because frankly who cares.  It was actually very weird for me reading that part because I haven't heard of an atarax allergy pill since I stopped taking it maybe 15 years ago when claritin started becoming popular.

Ah fuck it..move on.  I appreciate anyone who can read all of this.  Though I know it sounds very boring and not extreme at all and is very cluttered..but thanks.  I don't feel I need advice.  But if anyone can share similar stories of coming to terms with their depressions, I will appreciate it.  If you want to say something to the effect of, people with depression do not get As in calculus or have a professional work ethic, then you can go fuck yourself.  I've heard this enough.  There's got to be more horribly depressed people with seemingly put together lives.  If work needs to be done, I'll do it.  But at the end of the day, work stays at work, and I'm at home hoping to bleed my depression away.

b4s66,depression,rusle,My history and current predicament,"The history I'm telling you is pretty graphic and rough but I want to let it be known that I'm not trying to make this into some kind of pissing contest.  The reason I'm telling you is so you have some kind of background about where I am today, I'll try to get into the right amount of detail but eh, you can ask if you have further questions

Throughout my teens I suffered from depression and was on and off a few different kinds of anti-depressants.  I decided I'm not a big pill guy on account of the ED problems which would most likely exacerbate my issues.  (If anyone knows something weaker than lithium that doesn't have the ED problems, I'd be more than willing to look it up)

It's hard to figure out where it came from, but some of it is definitely genetic.  Part of it is probably also due to that puberty hit me in all the wrong ways.  I got ridiculous amounts of acne (had to go on accutane aka the strong stuff, but didn't start on it til college), I got braces + 4 (seriously...4) retainers and all the awkward puberty stuff, but I never really enjoyed the same kind of growth spurts or muscle build up or any of the good stuff that's supposed to come with the bad stuff.  

As a result I had a horrible history with girls and whenever I'd stick my head out and try to ask a girl out it would inevitably fail.  I'd say that at this point in my life I've probably asked out / made real attempts to get into a romantic relationship with around 30 girls.  Of those the longest relationship I've had has been a month, which still only amounted to having spent about 6 hours together, and the success rate of actually going out on a date is around 10%.  

I lost my virginity when I was just shy of 21 to a girl after we had hung out as friends twice and 30 minutes after I had told her I was a virgin.  I tried to contact her afterward but to no avail.  By definition a pity fuck.  While it was great to get over being a virgin, there was definitely no kind of emotional fulfillment out of it.  

I was just giving a little bit of my history of girls with that, but some other things happened during that time.  When I was around 16 I started having hallucinations.  My psychiatrist at the time said he thought it was ""Depression with psychotic features"" but I'd bet he thought I just wanted attention because my hallucinations didn't fit any standard archetypes (I wasn't having severe issues with staying coherent/sociable + I was having visual hallucinations which steers away from standard psychosis, but I wasn't paranoid and the hallucinations weren't related so that steered away from schizophrenia)

Today I'm fairly sure that what I had was actually hypnagogic hallucinations (when you wake up and you're in a mix between your own world and a nightmare) and the rest was in my head.  You kind of start second guessing reality after waking up in the night to a hallucination of a dog trying to rape you. (sorry about the shocker, but I think it's the best way to describe how bad these things were, I remember after my first really bad one I couldn't sleep without the lights on... as a 16 year old)

I also tried the whole self-mutilation bit by cutting myself but it didn't seem to do anything so I didn't do it.  I tried to kill myself a few times during my freshmen year of college (over the girl problems + I was being consistently bullied/mocked by my pledge brothers) I'd always run off with some means of offing myself but would back out at the last second.

I also used to be Christian, but my faith wasn't really strong enough to deal with all that shit and that went away, which led to less support than before.

I've also been dealing with alcoholism, I drank myself into a hospital when I was 22, I've gotten drunk and severely beat a person with what would amount to big metal pipe.  I think the biggest bender I ever had was about a month and a half of getting drunk every day.

I used to smoke a lot of pot to self medicate, but that didn't help much except to drain my wallet so I've quit that.

But, luckily there's a happy part of this story.  Through some unforeseen event I ended up getting an instrument to play. an ukulele.  I ended up loving it and directing everything I had in it and I can say today that with no feeling of boasting that I am quite good at it.  It's helped a lot with my depression and my hallucinations seem to have died down to having one every 5 months or so. (Don't quite know why)

There were of course good things too, I've always had friends and family to help me, not to mention psychiatry.  I think without that stuff I'd be somewhere very different right now.

That pretty much brings you up to speed (a couple things omitted that I don't want to talk about over the internet).  What's weird is that I've done a complete 180 and am for the most part relentlessly cheerful.  My dilemma right now is that I had to graduate earlier than I expected (I was going to stay in college one more semester for a minor) but financial problems kept me from that.

At this point I decided to take a look at what I most wanted to change in my life.  First was finding a job.  Second was finding a girl.  So I decided to be proactive on that front and do something about it.

And it sucked

I've put in a dozen job applications (using indeed.com) and haven't even gotten a response yet.  I've messaged probably 15 girls through various websites.  I didn't get a response, but I did get a girl who messaged me out of the blue, we're working on setting up a date.  The thing is, I have pretty low hopes for this date, because (apart from my experiences in the past) this girl seems more than a little off (but then again who's talking right?) which is not to mention she lives more than an hour away and seems to be a pretty adamant baptist whereas I'm a fairly adamant atheist.  I really hope I'm not sabotaging myself on this one, I've been known to do it before, and god help me I'm trying not to do it this time.

Ugh, just thinking about this kind of thing is killing me.  There's been lots of reasons it hasn't worked out for me and various girls including things like one girl who wouldn't kiss me after being together three weeks and would only come over when I cooked something.  Or one girl that they thought I was a drunk or whatever.  What creeps me out was the last girl I tried to ask out all of a sudden lost interest in me after she found out I wasn't christian.  I'm really worried about that happening again. 

Thanks for reading, in some kind of sick way I hope you enjoyed it.  I'd love some suggestions and of course words of encouragement are always welcome.",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b4s66/my_history_and_current_predicament/,1266794762
b4vsc,depression,athrowawaypersona,Is there any hope for me? (sorry for the ,"I'm 22 years old (M) and I've felt depressed and on again, off again suicidal since I was a child. I've done a good job up until recent years holding myself together and presenting a good face to the rest of the world. In college, however, cracks started to show. Despite an inglorious highschool career where I ended with no social contacts that I could even call friends, I hadn't subject my family to the full brunt of my problems. I do recognize that my depression factored into my mistakes in high school, but the ensuing rejection made matters much worse.

So, back to college, where all my insecurities and weaknesses became magnified, especially those about women, my creative work, and my likability/worth as a person. I began to seriously consider hanging myself. Nonetheless, the friends I made in college, mixed with the breaks and the good grades I got out of hard work in the university environment kept me going. In fact, I became a praise-whore, and the direction that I got the most praise in (Political Science) was where I got drawn. It didn't make me happy, though.

In fact, the more I got involved with PS, the more people (Professors I admired) began to treat me like some sort of prodigy in the field, signing me up for projects and activities that would help me along that path. Confronted with the pressure of doing something I fervently disliked (and was drawing me away from my creative work, which I missed terribly) I cracked under the pressure and withdrew from the major, the trip I was signed up to go on, and the debate society that everyone thought that I had promise in.

I ended switching to being an English major and taking a few classes in more creative subjects, like Theater. It's been hard work catching up on all my classes, but I only ended up falling a year behind, managing to catch a scholarship along the way. The time frame still eats at me sometimes when I think about all those accomplished people my age who have already graduated from Ivy League schools (I'm at a small state school) and are moving on to better and brighter things than I'll ever even grasp at.

In my romantic relationships (and my friendships to an extent), I can't seem to set good boundaries without feeling guilty or fearing that I'll be rejected. This always causes problems and always hurts everyone involved. My last serious relationship went from First Date to Moving Into My Parents' House with Me within six months, and I lost almost all of my friends from college in the process. The relationship consumed my life.

I'm now out of that relationship, officially, but I haven't been able to move on. I still have sex with the same girl, help her out all the time, and feel incapable of getting on with things. I can't even tell if I can evaluate her fairly and if getting away from her is a good idea.

My life feels like an irreconcilable shiatfest and I can't seem to find a good therapist: 3 different counselors in 2 years, and the failed process makes me not want to go back and try again. What do I do, reddit?

b56ja,depression,sad_panda321,Employment/life funk. Just need to write this out.,"I graduated from university in May. At that time I had a great boyfriend, was ready to rock my teacher certification exams, was applying for jobs like a whirlwind and was hopeful. Fast forward to now. Boyfriend has since dumped me (he didn't love me anymore.) I've passed my certification exams, but don't have a real teaching job to speak of. Right now I'm spending my time tutoring maybe 10-13 hours a week, making somewhere in the neighborhood of $700/mo. I've been trying to save up as much as I can, but what I earn sometimes isn't enough to pay both my bills, my rent, and keep me afloat. My parents are helping me out, which I am so thankful for, but at the same time so ashamed of. They're trying to retire, and they don't need to be supporting their 23 year-old failure of a daughter.

Every day I've been sending out job applications to any and all jobs I see, and I seem to be stuck in this limbo where I'm under qualified for any education-related jobs I apply for (they don't want to hire you unless you have teaching experience, you can't get teaching experience unless you get hired for a teaching job.) And all of the unskilled part-time jobs I'm applying for (McDonald's, gas stations, retail stores, etc) don't want to hire me because I have a degree, and to them having a degree means I have ambitions to not work at Wal-Mart for the rest of my life, and they don't want to worry about someone leaving their shitty job for a better one.

It's strange because I've never believed in God, but I'm starting to get a sense that if God does exist, his/her sole purpose is to sit here and push people to see how long it takes before they break. I've always been depressed, I was diagnosed when I was 12, as is my mother and my brother. I've always been able to somewhat manage it, but now I'm not so sure. Every day I wake up praying that someone is standing there with a gun to my temple and their finger on the trigger. I hope for that so that I can have the 2 seconds to look up at them and thank them before they kill me.

I'm a college graduate. I'm incredibly intelligent, I'm certified to teach, I'd be willing to put in the hard work and time if someone would just HIRE me. At this point I don't care if I were shoveling cow shit all day, I just want a full-time job that pays. I don't have the means to go back to school and get a better degree, my health insurance with my parents is lapsing in a year and change and if I don't have a steady job by then I'm kind of boned. I just want to chance to prove to someone that I CAN and WILL work, but nobody seems to want to hire me. 

And the dating world isn't going much better. I feel like I'm on this steady downhill slide into nothing. Every day I wake up and things just seem worse than the day before, and I'm not sure how much more I can take of this. My friends are all happily paired up and have someone there for them to at least give a hug at the end of a shitty day, and I feel that if I at least had something like that I could make it through this a little easier. But I don't. I am just so scared and so angry and so tired right now that I don't know what to do.",9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b56ja/employmentlife_funk_just_need_to_write_this_out/,1266875146

* Well I first started feeling like this around 9th grade, I do have poor self image, I started not caring anymore, always felt sleepy, slept a lot in class, pushed my grades aside, graduated on time but with only a c average.

* I go through most of my day normal but at least once a day I feel a window of well depression, overwhelming that I don't feel like doing anything productive. I feel stressed all the time, and nervous during even the most trivial of things.

* I still laugh, I enjoy doing things sometimes, but when I'm in that window or w/e I don't want to leave the house. I am also paranoid of everyone, sometimes I feel the need to assert myself to someone before they can hurt me, which always makes me an asshole. I can't imagine someone being genuinely interested in me. 

* I find myself repeating myself over and over, mostly during the thoughts before I fall asleep, and I want them to end so badly, they are so frustrating. I even find i am neglecting my health a lot. 

* I haven't really told anyone before, nor been to a doctor, and the fear of telling my family is overwhelming, regardless of contemplating it several times I have lacked to do it.

b5ego,depression,throwaway_65535,Reddit: I'm a depressed programmer and need help.,"Hi Reddit,

I'm going through a tough time at the moment and since I love and trust the reddit community I thought I'd try posting to see what advice fellow redditors can come up with.

I (was) a software developer and relocated to the SF bay area a year ago from NC (because I'm liberal and atheist) but have failed in the networking department and haven't made any true friends.

I've *noticed* symptoms of depression in myself for quite awhile now (maybe a year or two) which I think might have been triggered by a relationship breakup a couple years ago. But looking back, I've had depressive tendencies my entire life. Depression is in my family history as well. I'm generally shy and always in my head and thinking about hundreds of things, most related to social issues, religion, politics, etc. These are things I'm passionate about, though since I know I don't have much control over these things, I've recently put them aside, but replaced them with other pessimistic thoughts regarding my physical health, skillset, my (lack of) career, family, etc.

I was laid off recently and am now unemployment and of course don't have money to throw at under-skilled psychiatrists, medicines that might not yield the desired outcome, etc.

One problem that I find myself in, is that due to the nature of my last job, I have a few holes in my skillset. They're not major, and I'm a pretty smart guy, but the point is that I need to be able to study, program for fun, and learn some things to make myself more marketable and increase my chances of finding a job. This is not something unique to me, as I think I'm a very competent developer compared to some... the problem is that due to my mental state I have a very difficult time studying, focusing, conceptualizing and remembering.

I'm also having a hard time coping with stresses which should be quite normal, and sometimes feel like my brain has quit working, and that I need to sleep in order to reboot my brain. I don't exercise and don't eat enough. I have quite a bit of knowledge but not much willpower.

The only way I am able to cope is to do passive things that require no thought, or things like playing video games which are still fun for me and have no associated negative emotions.

This post is probably TLDR and all over the place, but I guess the basic problem is that due to what is probably depression, I'm in somewhat of a downward spiral... slowly losing my financial gains, health, friends, my mind, career, etc. I don't have family I can turn to, since my parents are very religious and my problems would unnecessarily burden them (and probably make things worse for me rather than better). They might be able to aid me financially if it came to that, but likely not emotionally.

Redditors: I think the main thing that would help me right now is to meet people who can relate to what I've described. Convential wisdom says that you should hang around people who are the type of people you want to become, but at this point, doing that has failed because those types of people aren't looking to build a relationship with me, and I can no longer relate to them. Instead I need friends who have gone through the same thing, OR friends who are carefree and like to play video games or smoke weed etc... basically cool, non-judgemental people. This could help me more than any psychologist since it's not information I'm lacking. Then again, perhaps I do need meds, but I'm not sure.

It's difficult to explain... but basically my friends back home were fun... but right-wing, religious, or not intellectual. Because I had a professional career, everyone I've met in the bay area is intelligent, yet busy and not going to waste time on things I'm interested in. I'm a good person and loyal friend, just no longer a high achiever because I feel the need to de-stress as much as possible. WTB: Hippies.

Thanks, if you've managed to read this far. And thanks Reddit, just for existing... you always give me hope in humanity.",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b5ego/reddit_im_a_depressed_programmer_and_need_help/,1266920401

b5qd0,depression,[deleted],Am I just being a pussy?,"I guess what's been bothering me has a bit to do with a recent conversation with my ex of 4 and a half years. Apparently she finds it hard to resist making out with the random Argentine guys because somehow all of them kiss really seductively and apparently give that ""butterfly"" feeling with such ease. While she's my ex, and it shouldn't get to me, it does, because she rarely got that feeling when I was with her, and it was only with great effort and feeling that she got it. Makes me feel like a bad kisser, like I'm completely inept when it comes to pretty much the most basic of intimate things.  
Then it got piled on top of other thoughts about my previous experiences with girlfriends that got me distraught.  
First cheated on me 2 weeks in.  
Second would rarely even look in my general direction and lost interest in 2 weeks.
Third didn't even want to kiss me let alone actually be in a relationship with me.
Fourth was her, and not only was I just not that good of a kisser to her, but she even hated sex with me no matter what we did. That apparently just about anyone can get with these days with little to no effort at all.
And all the fifth had to say on the subject of it was that my kisses were ""different."" Which is a lot like your teachers saying you're ""unique"" to your parents, because they don't want to be mean and just say you're weird. Kissing aside, I still wasn't more attractive than one ex that would beat the shit out of her, and another that did nothing but have sex with her then tell her to go home.  
Though this lack of self-esteem is a long standing thing with people constantly berating me on my weight, or lack thereof, being shot down, and sudden unexplainable losses of interest in me, both as friends with people in general and with women.  
Maybe I have bad taste in women?  
Maybe women have bad taste in me?

b5u95,depression,imsotired2,I'm so Tired of Trying,"Hi, /r/ depression, I just cut myself, so I'm feeling pretty good right now. I've been grappling with social anxiety for most of my life, to the point where I've isolated myself from people and haven't built the requisite social capital to create new friendships. About a month ago I started seeing a therapist, offered for free by my campus, who's been pretty worthless. She wanted to get me to to that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but she did a pretty poor job constructing the treatment; she wanted me to do it through this internet website (which IMO is pretty bad; I think she's a student, which might explain why she's terrible), she got personally offended when I told her this was an awful way to do treatment, and now we don't do anything. She's so incredibly bad that her only solution to the problem was to tell me to 'try focusing on other people' like its some kind of effective cure for social anxiety. 

ANYWAYS, last friday I cut myself for the first time, and it was amazing. It was literally the first time I've been happy in 5 years. The world was so beautiful, I took a walk outside, and felt like normal happy people feel. I have no idea why I should stop. I tried the therapy route, it didn't work. I want to go on anti-depressants, which means I'm going to have to tell my parents about my problem, but in the meantime, I think I'm going to use cutting to cope. 

Anti-depressants apparently don't work in the long run though, and neither does cutting (because you build a tolerance), so my question to you /r/ depression is: what are other ways to deal with this problem besides therapy? What are your experiences with Group Therapy? I feel like it'll feel like being indoctrinated into some cult led by some 30-something passive-aggressive narcissist with a messiah complex. It trivializes the problem, just like a fucking website does. I just need a way to cope so I can be normal (and no I don't have access to weed, and no, I can't buy alcohol).

b5vdu,depression,Vellon221,Is this depression?,"Where to start.

I was with a girl coming out of high school and the following five years.  All through high school, and even before I struggled with social anxiety, panic attacks and GAD.  The relationship was often rocky, but I put a lot of effort into it and she helped me with my problems.  I finally managed to get off the Xanax and live a seminormal life.

About three quarters of a year ago I discovered she had been cheating on me on and off for about three months.  I ended the relationship, got drunk and high for a month and then began putting myself and my life back together.

I've now returned to college, have an apartment with a good friend and my two cats, etc.  I've dated a couple other girls both met online and in person.  I wasn't able to connect emotionally with any of these women, so they were short term affairs.  Things were going fairly well - I don't feel I was in denial, I was/am very cut up about the way things worked out with the original girl.

Starting about four weeks ago, I began to feel disconnected and gloomy.  While I continue to go about my day to day life of college, and continue to spend time with my (albeit small) circle of friends, I find myself deriving only a minimum of pleasure from these occurrences.  And then once I'm back at home alone my emotional state quickly plunges further and further down.  I've got this black pit sitting in my gut that refuses to be shaken off.  I've had horrible insomnia to top all of this off.

My schoolwork is suffering and I'm worried that my friendships will be next.  I've been having a lot of fantasies about selfharm although I don't think I could ever actually do it.

So what I need to know is, is this depression?  Am I really 'depressed' and not just upset over this failed relationship and betrayal of trust?  If I'm depressed, wtf do I do now?  I don't have a GP, so do I just walk into a clinic?  (I'm canadian)

I don't think I can afford a psychologist in any way.  I'm living in a very small apartment off of student loan money because I lost my job, and it's hard to find another with school.",10,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b5vdu/is_this_depression/,1267010452
b6llx,depression,Thisisathrowawayacc,Hello again /r/Depression. I could use some advice...,"Yesterday was my birthday. It was a day where I did virtually nothing and just wanted some peace and quiet, closed off from the world.

I've been seeing a psychologist for the last 6 months to help with what I believed was an increasing sense of anxiety, which very recently developed into panic attacks, which I'd never had before and scare the hell out of me.

I've never had a very close relationship with my family, which I put largely down to a conservative upbringing and having various symptoms of what I now know as Depression. (Something I wasn't diagnosed with until I was about 21)

I know I'm socially awkward, definitely suffer from Anxiety, and I feel like I'm getting worse. My sister just sent me a massive email blasting me for going out with friends to a theme park earlier in the week, but not responding to her messages quickly, something that really annoys her. I hate facebook for this reason. The message was about when she could drop around a present, which I didn't ask for or really need, but has now blown out into a near-fued. 

I have no idea how to approach this situation, as it seems like she's giving me an ultimatum to change the way I am or walk away. No one in my family knows the way I feel, that I've had depression or that I'm seeing a psychologist. My family have a knack of making me feel bad and guilty for feeling the way I do.

I have no idea how to approach this situation.

b7i40,depression,[deleted],Upside to depression? Has anyone else had epiphanies while feeling down?,"So I just recently got over my depression (somewhat), and remember that most of my time was spent lounging about in my apartment, watching tv shows/movies online, browsing random blogs and websites, taking breaks only to eat, take naps, or take smoke breaks. I remember the smoke breaks that I took late at night, after my roommates and what seemed like the rest of the neighborhood had gone to sleep, often having more than one cigarette, staring off into the sky or at the bushes and trees that grew behind our patio while deep in thought. 

It was during these moments where I would mull over the main events that brought about my depression. This would always lead to other thoughts, the usual of thinking that maybe if I wished hard enough, I would find myself a few months or even a year back in time with the knowledge to prevent everything and give myself a happier life, to the thought of moving away to a different city or state or even country to start a new life... and inevitably, to the thoughts regarding self. Why do I act the way I do? What motivates me? Why do I say what I say? What makes me perceive things the way I do? Has my perception of things all been a lie? Has reality been differerent the whole time? What are the factors that made me who I am today? 

I remember it was during these times when I would hit upon a thought so profound and so revealing about myself that it was amazing. I've had a lot of these come to me and although I hated everything about my depression, this was one thing I enjoyed. The things I learned from these thoughts helped me feel somewhat wiser, more mature. I felt as if this deeper understanding of myself helped me to understand others better, and understand a bunch of other things as well. 

Sorry I can't be more articulate with my thoughts, but yeah.. that's the gist of things. I also remember reading an article somewhere (might have been on reddit) that argued that depression might actually be good in some way. It talked about how the great philosophers of ancient Greece often spoke of a meloncholy disease, and that this was what gave way to the great thoughts and philosophies that they authored. If I can find the link I'll post it up here. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else has similar experiences with this?

b7p0l,depression,FunFishRueFish,I am a curmudgeon.,"I am a 20 y/o (M) currently going to a university in the US.  I have so much going for me right now, and I honestly don't mean to be boastful, but so many of the brave people who have posted their stories on here would absolutely LOVE to switch lives with me.  But, I can't shake this depression.

No one (really) close to me has died.  My parents are still together and I get along great with them and my sister.  I moved once when I was seven, but was able to make new friends pretty easily, and I am still friends with some of them today.  I have friends I can confide in and some I can even trust.

As I said earlier, I go to school, and am on pace to get an engineering bachelor's degree.  I am currently doing a paid co-op program with NASA and I essentially have a guaranteed position from them when I graduate where I will make more than enough money to be able to easily survive and then some.  I am also still on my parents' health insurance policy; money is not a problem in the slightest.

I am almost positive that my depression comes from the fact that I am a virgin and have been too much of a pussy to do anything about it.  I have all of the common symptoms: lack of interest in things I once liked, unable to complete anything.  My case is so textbook and boring.  I completely understand that I am only 20, I’m still just a kid, and it’s never too late to change, and definitely not too late to find someone and enjoy my 20s, but I just can’t find the motivation.  I swear to god, if there were a guaranteed blowjob at the end of the day, I would put the new cover sheets on the TPS reports with a smile on my face.

Obviously, this revolves around a girl with whom I’ve been madly in love for the last 5 years.  I’m currently in the friend zone, blah blah blah.  (just tell her how you feel, take a chance, you’ll regret it if you don’t, you probably won’t even be talking with her 5 years from now anyway) I KNOW! I’ve read just about every reddit post about the friend zone for advice, but…

The thing is that I have already done this (twice actually).  The first time was back in high school, and I did it all wrong.  I blamed her for not liking me back and for some reason I thought that guilt tripping her into liking me would work.  The best part was that I did it all online.  I’ve chalked that experience up as being a novice person, I’ve grown from it and it definitely taught me a lot about perspective.  She wouldn’t talk to me for 6 months after that.  I thought I lost her as a friend.  Blah blah, I grew up and we eventually started talking again and our friendship resumed where it left off.  The second time was the night before I went off to college (she was a year younger and still in high school).  Essentially, I just wanted to be able to move on and get her out of my head as she was the only thing on my mind.  I sat down with her in person and told her she was the most beautiful person I’d ever met, that I was sorry for practically throwing away our friendship earlier, and that if I got a kiss then hopefully I’d be able to move on with my life.  I got the kiss (woot!), went home, went to college, stayed in fairly good contact with her for the next year, and believed that I was sufficiently cured of her… until she got a boyfriend and I realized just how jealous I was.  While she was with the boyfriend, she didn’t talk to me as much and was always too busy to hang out (which was to be expected, I know, it was just hard for me to swallow since I wasn’t in a relationship of my own).  After he dumped her, we became pretty close again and that’s where we are now.

Anyway, I have interpersonal emotion anxiety issues.  I find it very difficult to open up to girls and tell them how I feel about them especially in person.  I’ve done it three times, but I had to psych myself up so much it’s a joke.  That fear of just putting myself out there is debilitating; it makes me physically sick.  I’ll forget what I’m saying as I say it and lock up and freeze.  I discovered this morning that it’s getting even worse.  Like anybody else I exist with a lot of cognitive dissonance, so I’ve convinced myself that it’s OK that I’ll never be with her and that it’s most important to keep her in my life as a friend, despite not truly believing any of that bullshit.  So after hanging out with her this weekend at her school, I knew she was still down about being dumped, and I just wanted to tell her she was beautiful and that her boyfriend was an idiot for throwing the best thing in his life away, and that everything will be OK (completely platonically I swear!).  I psyched myself up for 2 hours this morning to tell her that, and right when the moment of truth came and I was about to say it, I bailed and said goodbye and left to go back to my school.  I can’t even talk to my friends anymore; the anxiety is so bad.

Getting back to serious matters, I’m almost positive my depression would go away if I got laid by any chick, just something from which to build confidence.  I just can’t find the motivation to try anymore.  I’ve had so many close calls fail to pan out, and on top of it, this chick has totally fucked up my head.  I’m perfectly aware of the self-fulfilling prophecies I am creating for myself, and I think I actually enjoy being caught in the cycle, in some sick cognitively dissonanced way.

I could never bring myself to commit suicide.  My mom’s brother died in a car accident before I was born.  I was told that I was named after my grandfather, but I’m pretty I was actually named after my dead uncle (we all have the same name just to be clear).  I cannot imagine how hard that must be to lose someone close to you like that, and I couldn’t bear to do that again to my mom, so that’s ruled out.  Today I realized that this is also the only reason suicide has been ruled out.

I’m aware how pathetic this sounds.  Literally my only problem is that I have no problems, except the ones I create for myself.  I’m honestly whineier than Holden Caulfield, and I’ve been described recently as a curmudgeon.  Oftentimes I wish something horrible had actually happened in my life, so at least I would have a legitimate excuse for wanting people to pity me.  I know how horrible that is.  When my dog of 14 years died last year, I was actually comforted by the fact that at least people would feel bad for me (if only for a short while).

Thank you for reading this.  I know I just have to get over it, grow a pair, and just get back out there and over my anxiety, but it’s hard pretending to be fine when your head is just a shitstorm of contradictions.

b867c,depression,[deleted],Is it worth it to see a Doctor/Therapist?,"22 y/o Male, just graduated from college with a Degree in journalism.

Things started going downhill after I lost my rent house and almost everything I own in hurricane Gustav and have never really come back up since then.  I've never really thought of myself as a depressed person until just recently when I realized how the last few years of my life have went.  I find myself wanting to be alone because I manage to see the annoying points of any person I meet and those points wether they be many or few, push me away from them.  I've stopped seeing a lot of my friends and I'm currently down to around 8 people that I actually associate with although I find myself barely even wanting to see any of them lately. 

When I graduated all of my dreams of a decent job were crushed when I realized that all the TV/Radio jobs I looked at want years and years of experience and I only have about two years when it comes to radio.  So now I'm working late night shifts as a security guard making just enough to cover expenses with a little left over on the side.  At first I hated the job because I couldn't make myself not think enough to deal with 8 hours of staring at a TV full of camera displays, but now I find that I can easily cope with just barely being conscious of my surroundings enough to log in pretend information in the logbook.  I've managed to basically dumb myself down enough to where I can stand the job.  The low pay leaves me feeling even more depressed because I feel that all the extra stuff in my life has to go because its not being used.  DVDs, Clothes, Bed (I just want a floor mat to save space), computer accessories, etc.  I get the feeling that I have to sell everything so I'll have extra money to cushion my budget just incase I spend to much on food this month.  

My life has become a cycle of eat, sleep, work.  I don't really have happy moments anymore. I use to be talkative but now I find that I'd rather sit in silence when I'm hanging out with friends.

I'm currently contemplating getting a 1 room apartment so that I don't have to deal with roommates and I figure I could budget my bills more successfully alone. (I live with people who couldn't give a shit about the environment and saving money.)

I've thought about about seeking help even to the point of walking across campus when I was at school for one session with a Therapist but I never went back because I felt I could solve my own problems.  I also get the feeling that needing help makes me weak or damaged. Being on medication scares me as well even though I have done drugs in the past (weed, lsd, shrooms, mdma, 2ci, adderal from friends) 

I'm scared to tell my parents about all of this because the one time I brought it up to my mom in private she told me that depression doesn't exist when we have Jesus. (they don't know I stopped caring about religion)

TL;DR - Did you find it worth while to seek professional help or would you rather have worked it out yourself?",10,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b867c/is_it_worth_it_to_see_a_doctortherapist/,1267527091
b89n1,depression,[deleted],I made a pretty bad mistake.,"I made the mistake of assuming that I have some kind of innate talent that would trump all of the bad things in my life, and all of the mistakes that I made academically and socially. I made the assumption that if I could show anyone how well I could write, that I would be immediately accepted into college, at some job, into some group; anything. I was wrong. I don't know why I thought that I would be right.

I've gotten my second college rejection letter, from one of the less selective schools that I applied to. I tried to write a stellar application essay; one that would potentially pardon my on-the-bad-side-of-mediocre-grades. It was evidently not stellar. It is evident that my writing won't save me. It is evident that I've ruined myself by ignoring my school work in favor of leisure, and that what I have isn't enough. It's apparent that if I wrote a book, it wouldn't sell, and that if I were to apply to some work in the field of writing, I would not be hired because of my lack of academic fortitude. Basically, I suck. I suck because I ruined my school years, and now I have to consider what I have to do to compensate for that.

It's crushing to think about. I'm not exceptional. I'm not good enough. And what's most crushing is that *I thought that I was.* What am I supposed to do? I've been trying to change my life. I've been trying to get rid of distractions and really work on my schoolwork, but what am I supposed to do? I feel like it's too late for that. Chances are, I'm going to have to go to a community college for some amount of time and reapply to these schools that I would like to go to. That isn't so much the issue. The issue is that I'm average, and I've lived my life hoping and thinking otherwise. I can't live my life with the knowledge that I'm not intrinsically **good** at anything.

bak16,depression,elprup,Just some thoughts,"Hi everyone,

I just did a sort of journaling type thing for the first time ever and I think it was actually useful. I guess I feel like I should share it somewhere so here goes.

Basically my mood just feels SUPER unstable. When I'm happy, it's like I feel un-clouded (it's almost a sober feeling) and rational, I think about the times that I'm depressed and realize they are all just overreacting to insignificant things. I have a lot more energy (not necessarily physical energy, but mental energy kind of, if that makes sense... energy to engage with people and ""be happy"") and I feel actually alive.

When I'm depressed, on the other hand, I feel like the happiness mode was just fake and that this depressed feeling is the real thing. I feel like I'll never feel happy for real, and that the happiness instances I have aren't real, they're just temporary distractions from the depression. The depressed mode sometimes becomes panicky-depressed, kind of freaking out, almost suicidal just because of the overwhelming sense that I'll never feel better. I don't want to do anything, I just want all the badness to end.

The worst part is that I have no control over when each mode happens, which is pretty scary. The two are so different that it feels like two different people, competing over who is actually real/correct. (Obviously) I feel like depressed me is overwhelmingly stronger, and actually creeps into happy me time now too.

bbst6,depression,[deleted],"I'm feeling good and happy right now, but I'm afraid that feeling is going to pass","I've been struggling with mild depression for about 2 years now. I'm a junior in college and I think it's partly due to a combination of stress and being away from home and friends. I have friends here at school, but they're nothing like my friends from home (that I've known since preschool). My friends at school seem to be more like ""time fillers"" instead of people I actually want to be around.

Things got really bad for me last September. My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me and school was starting again. I felt trapped and alone and helpless. Slowly I pulled out of it, but things haven't been great. I've thought about my ex girlfriend a lot. And my thoughts also focus on my current lack of a girlfriend. I just sort of pushed through it feeling alone and unhappy.

Last week was our spring break. I went on a ski trip with my ski club from school. It was amazing. So much fun. I got to know new people, ski, and go out and party at night and have fun. It was exactly what I needed. I came back to school on an emotional high from it and a boost of confidence. The weather also turned from below freezing to spring-like. So I've just been feeling good this week.

But I'm afraid it's going to go away. Deep down, I know that nothing has changed. That I'm still in the same situation I've been in all year. With hard classes, mediocre friends and not much to look forward to. So I'm afraid I'm going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to come back crashing down.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with something like this? I feel like I have a fresh attitude and perspective on things, and I don't want it to go away.

I barely studied for my midterms, and failed most of them. My computer has been sitting in pieces on the floor for almost a week because I don't have enough interest to put my motherboard back in.

I really only have two good friends in the world, and I can't discuss anything serious with them. They already mock me a little bit for being ""lazy"" when it comes to school, but they don't know the half of it. We never discuss anything serious, we just joke around. When it comes to ""medium"" friends, I've only made one or two since I graduated from high school three years ago. It was more or less on accident; the exact same way I made all of my friends in high school.

My family is a bunch of fundie Christians, I can't discuss anything serious with them either. Partly because they'd have nothing useful to say (no, I don't need Jesus), and partly because I don't want to admit any weakness to them. I'm the lone atheist when it comes to my family and nearly all of my acquaintances, I need to be strong. But I'm... not right now.

So I took on all of these projects that will make me look good: a website where I will explain science to an audience and in turn I will learn more; learning Python; trying to motivate myself to work harder.

And then one day I went to a friend's birthday party and decided to smoke pot. After that night, something happened. I felt as if all my beliefs were changing. I used to love babies and the thought of having my own children some day when I realized that I'm too selfish to sacrifice my freedom and time and happiness to a kid that will likely hate me for half of their lives. I wanted to get married but now I feel that it's because I don't want to die alone.

And I've lost my motivation. I just want to lie in bed all day and lose myself in a book. I want to watch videos about science but not actually apply myself. And the last week (it may be two, I don't know, time is blending together) has been a mess of emotions; I'll cry and ask myself ""What's wrong with me?"" and then I'll feel indifferent. Then I'll look at my pile of homework and studying and then I'll become anxious and cry again. Because it's the only thing I can do. I'm pitiful.

I rarely ever reach out to people but I took the initiative to ask for help from a professor (the school didn't have any available openings for counseling and that alone was extremely depressing) and he tells me I can communicate with him whenever I'd like.

bee1r,depression,DepressionThrowAway,"Not sure what to do, and hate to admit it...","Well, let me start this off concerning two things:
1) Yes, I have created a ""throw away"" account for this subreddit (as you can tell from my username) which goes to point two...
2) I am one of those people who doesn't ask for help, even if there is a situation in which I should.  I think I've learned/inherited this from my father but  I honestly am not sure.  So hence why I am speaking to you under an anonymous/throw away account, and haven't told anyone I know in person what has been going on.  I just can't seem to do it, and for me I think it would show a side of weakness and I've always tried to be one of those people that ""you can rely on in any situation"".

I'm not really sure what has been going on with me for the past 2/3 months now.  Let me give you some more background information so you may understand where I am coming from, and may also not understand why I am feeling depressed/unmotivated.

I graduated college with my undergraduate degree last May.  I am now going full time for my graduate degree.  While I was going for my undergrad, I was living in my alone in own apartment since the location was about 5 hours from my parents house.  Now that I am going for my grad degree and have been doing so online, I am living back with my parents to save up money so that when I'm finished I can try and buy a house.  I do currently have a full time job (yes, even in this economy) which I also do from home.  Besides that, I am also working on 4 other projects with various people and different areas as well as independent research outside of my grad degree requirements.  I am currently in a relationship and have been for the past 3 years.  Everything sounds great right?  Well that is where I am confused.  I have no motivation to do anything, I've been oversleeping in the morning unless I actually HAVE to get up for something (my work can be morning or night shift) and find myself actually setting my alarms so I wake up every time minutes or so in the morning for hours anymore since once I fall back asleep I go right back into dreaming which takes me into a different world in and of itself.

I just can't seem to find anything that gives me that ""feel amazing"" feeling anymore.  Don't get me wrong, when I am around my significant other I do have some happier moments than others.  I used to be a generally all around happy person no matter the situation, always someone you could talk to if you had a bad day and I could chear you up.  Now I just seem to be moving through life and not really experiencing it, just there for the ride.  I've tried many things (even just watching a movie, I do get sucked into the movie but the whole time I never get that ""wrapped up"" feeling and everything else in the world is still in the back of my mind no matter what).  I know this may sound odd considering my previous comment, but I am also one of those people who ""compartmentalize"" their thoughts and feeling.  For example, if Jim (just a made up name) and I have a fight and then we both walk away and I start to do something else, that doesn't really affect me as I am now concentrating on something else.  But also lately I can't seem to concentrate on any one single thing as my mind is wondering and I have no idea where the feelings of depression would be coming from as there aren't any specific triggers.

So to sum it all up, I'm not really sure what I'm asking or if any of the above is normal and I should just shut up, deal with it and try and get on with myself.  I don't know what I expect to get out of it, nor what I am anticipating.  Umm, I guess that's it.  I can answer any questions you might have if there are any.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bee1r/not_sure_what_to_do_and_hate_to_admit_it/,1268806676

bf9io,depression,[deleted],"There is nothing I would like more, than to go back and let her kill me.","When I was four years old my parents divorced. This is seemingly the beginning to an unremarkable tale but my mother was a psychopath and she could not understand why my father left her. She set our house on fire with me inside of it. When the fire department came I was cowering in the corner of my room. My mother said she had no idea I was home and talked her way out of child endangerment. Losing my father had a huge impact on her and she did everything she could to get him in jail for ""abuse"". When I was 5 she did it, based on a police report that didn't exist. She was my sole custodial parent. After I turned 6 my mother had started coke, and she had begun to abuse me heavily. By the time I was 7 she was on crack. We began to lose all kinds of money so she started using me as payment for her drugs. I was sent to her drug dealer on my birthday to give him his present (we had the same birthday). I think I was 10 before I realized this didn't happen to other kids. Once my mother saw I was grasping what she was doing wrong she began beating me and telling me she could do whatever she wanted to me and no one would know. I was forced into staying quiet. 

By the time I was 12 I was on coke, and I was a my mothers sex slave. I felt terrible about myself and I hated my life. I started fighting other girls from my neighborhood and I began to get a 'reputation' as the tough little white girl who could hold her own. I took all the anger I had towards my mother and I took it out on other girls. 

13 I started fighting my mother back, I got off coke and I was telling any authority figure I could about what she was doing. No one particularly listened so after our large physical fights I would take pictures and I would call the police. My mother said I was a devil child and I was trying to make her look bad and that she was the victim. She was wonderful at playing the victim. She played it so well, I began to believe that I was the one doing things wrong. 

At 14 my mother saw she had no control over me anymore, so while she was driving me to school she pulled into the woods and I asked her where we were going and she told me it didn't matter. My mother then pulled out a knife and tried to stab me, I jumped out of her car and ran. I don't know how long I ran, but I got to a construction site and collapsed. A worker found me and called the police because I had a large gash on my stomach and cuts all over. I told the police officer what happened and I was signed into the youth home for run-away and troubled teens. 

The investigations against my father were cleared and I was allowed to live with him.

I began to feel better, I was happier and everything in my life seemed to be going well. 

Now, I am 16 and I am more depressed than ever. I want to be dead and I don't understand why because there isn't anything that should be bothering me.

bfk3x,depression,[deleted],I hate being in love,"I mean it's only ever been a one-way thing for me.

I always craved intimacy (in either love or friendship) and don't think I will ever have it. I'm not very good at being social, I don't know if I'm dislikeable (some people seem to like me) but no matter how many friends I have I'll never be close to anyone. The only time I may have gotten close I was constantly shunned in favour of other people. I watched everyone I loved (in either respect) enjoy the intimacy/affection that I never would. I was seriously considering suicide for a while but I don't think I'll ever repeat that. Or self harming. I think it's just stupid and ridiculous.

I got over it for a while. I forced myself to. When I thought about a girl I liked, or about those people who I was a ""sideline friend"" of but would never be close friends with because there simply wasn't room for me in their minds, or about how it was unlikely that I would ever find someone just to hold sometimes, I swallowed it down and let it die in agony in my stomach acids while frantically trying to think of something else to think about.

It seemed to work. Suddenly, while not happy about my fate, I was at peace with it. Fuck it dude, let's go bowling. Just do the things you want to do and fuck everybody else. I just avoided even trying to get close to anyone after that and I really think I'm in for a life alone, for better or worse.

Usually I can deal with it but there's nothing like falling in love to bring all this shit back. Instead of turning me into a hopeful lovestruck moron like it would have done years ago it leaves me a despairing wreck wondering just how the fuck I'm going to deal with it this time.

I'll go back to swallowing that shit down I guess. Other than that, everything's good.

bgdiu,depression,UsagiMimi,"I'm on a ""vacation"" and REALLY don't want to go home. (Explanation/recent history inside) ","Well, I'll start with the present. I'm from Minnesota, I'm a vacation to meet, well, my girlfriend that I met online, and her friends. Things are going wonderfully. I guess I should explain here that I am transgendered, just because it plays into everything. But things are going wonderfully, better than I'd ever imagined. She's the first person I've ever known I can honestly say loves me. She loves me for everything about me. I've had partners in the past, but nothing like this. I come from a background of extremely low self esteem from my childhood and other things. Now, to add to a bit of depression, and I always knew this... We could never live together. She has two adopted kids and a ""husband."" Their relationship is open, he knows about me and everything, but due to adoption services... Since they originally adopted the kids (Whom were her best friends, both died by a drunk driver) when married, adoption services has threatened to take them away if they got divorced, oh, and they've had the kids 4 years now. 

Anyways,  about 4 years ago, right before I actually moved out on my own for the first time when I was 18 to escape my rather... abusive family I was in a car accident. The injury wasn't so apparent right away, only a good amount of pain for the first few months. Then, as I was working and saving for college for the first time, 4 months after the accident I started having job performance issues, I could no longer do my job, due to the pain I was in, and the muscles in my left shoulder got weaker and weaker and weaker, and have left me unable to lift much... I was forced to move back home to Minnesota, from Atlanta, GA, by my medical insurance for further treatment. Anyway, it was back to my family. I got suicidal for a few reasons, and deeply depressed for about two years. I couldn't find a job which I could work, the only 2 friends I had, had moved away in the 6 months I was gone (I was homeschooled, so small circle of RL people I ever knew) and yeah, it sucked. Eventually I was able to open up a small online 3D modeling business, which after a year and a half of building up, brings me about $800 a month... Which I'm using to pay off debts I gathered, and medical payments since my car insurance dropped medical coverage after $60,000 in diagnostics, physical therapy, etc, didn't help. 

Well, this fall, I finally came out to my mother (I never could my father, or I'd lose the only home I have) about being transgendered. It didn't go well, but it was... Tolerated. Shortly after, my sister, my only sibling alive (my brother died of a drug overdose) got her 3rd DUI. She is definitely an alcoholic and such. The amount of... sympathy and support she has gotten my entire life has been astounding in comparison with my own. My parents bought her 4 cars, she totaled every one. My parents refused to even help with a down payment on my car. Anyways... They've been extremely supportive with her, and over time, my mother has been more and more... mentally violent about my transgenderism. I finally did get into a clinic specializing in it, and was diagnosed as definitely transgender, things went to hell with her after that. Because she realized it was a ""phase."" 

During this time, I met my partner online, and she supported me 100% of the way with everything. She's the only one. I used saved up flier miles to get round trip plane tickets from MN to Oklahoma where she lives, and about a month's income on a cheap, but decent hotel and the rest for two weeks. I go back on Saturday. I've been dreading it, constantly... Just dreading it, because the entire time I've been here, every stress, almost everything that made me feel depressed every day when I woke up is gone. It's just not there. For the first time in 4 years I've felt truly happy. 

Then tonight, I had a phone call from my mother. Next monday, I have an appointment with my psychiatrist, which honestly... I'll probably need, being back home. But my sister goes to court for sentencing for her drunk driving that day, and my mom will be out of town. I was called to be notified, I have to go for moral support for her. (Which if you knew her past with me, violently attacking me, kicking me out of my room when she was drunk, after dragging some guy home at 3 A.M. in the middle of the night all through my childhood to have sex with in my bed, etc...) you'd understand a little bit of the problem... I do love her, and I have supported her. But if I miss the appointment with my psychiatrist, the next one isn't for a month, and I already know there are no re-opening reschedules. 

Anyhow, I asked her- Since recently she's said very hurtful things to me about being different at all, none the less transgendered. ""Why should she get moral support and I get none, ever?"" Her answer was ""She hasn't done anything wrong."" 

It's her 3rd DUI, technically her 5th, but two were over 10 years ago. I've never even had a speeding ticket. Apparently something illegal/being alcoholic &lt; just trying to be myself, and stop being suicidal. 

Ranting really helped, sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you all. And yeah, I'm trying to get to move out, but I won't be able to for at least 9 months. Also, I can't be on disability yet (I've consulted a couple lawyers about it, and I am in a lawsuit over the car accident, but that's going painfully slow. The accident was 100% the person's fault who hit me. Was stopped at a stop light, then rear ended at 40 mph.)

bgysp,depression,zerothehero,Wellbutrin is like magic for me,"If you haven't tried it, and other things aren't working, I encourage you to.  FWIW Prozac apparently does absolutely nothing for me.

I took it 5-6 years ago, but then stupidly stopped because a new doctor flaked out and sort of discouraged me from using it.

I slowly slipped back into depression, without ever realizing how bad it was getting.

I waited much too long to go back to the doctor.  The irony of depression is that it deprives you of the energy to get it treated.

So amazingly it's helped me on multiple fronts.  I was NOT expecting it to work this well:

1) **Increased energy** -- I had a serious problem with lethargy.  I couldn't get out of the house by 3pm some days, and I was falling asleep at 6pm other days.  Now I'm energetic and doing stuff in the evenings (staying up a bit late).

I felt like I was ""trapped"" -- that I would never be able to muster the energy to even move apartments, even though I don't like my current situation much.  That dread of moving feels a little silly now.

A common feeling when antidepressants are working is that you felt like you had this *enormous* problem from some trivial thing... I know a lot of you feel that way here.  It's impossible to look at rationally, but know that your feelings of helplessness are an illusion.

2) **Increased sex drive and more intense orgasms**.  I don't think this is common knowledge, but it makes my orgasms much more intense, sometimes explosively so.  I definitely had a lower sex drive even without the depression -- I feel this is more normal.

3) **Lost pleasure from smoking**.  It's amazing how pronounced this is -- smoking a cigarette just tastes like smoky paper now.  It doesn't produce that pleasure/comfort.  For those who don't know, Wellbutrin is also sold as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban.  I quit smoking on it 5-6 years ago, but then gradually started again after I got off it.

4) I feel like I am **surfing the Internet less compulsively**.  Before I would feel the itch to surf the Internet right when I got up.  And I would click links a little too obsessively, like opening 20 tabs so I could switch between them really fast.

So it's kind of amazing that **one** single drug does all these things!  The mind is a weird thing.

One thing which I don't know if it's good or bad is that I have less of a ""need"" to program.  I was addicted to programming, and learning a ton.  That's the only thing I did for the last couple years.  I think I drove myself insane.

I had sort of megalomanical visions of a great intellectual achievement... not entirely delusional, but now it doesn't feel as important.

I have been on it 6 weeks now.  Who knows how it will work out in the future -- will I have to take it the rest of my life?  I have had basically no real side effects -- a little dry mouth, some jitters the first day.  But those effects appear gone now.

So I hope it keeps working.  Please try it if other things have failed you.  I feel like it is fundamentally different than Prozac and SSRIs.

bhhc2,depression,notecard,Just want to get this out...,"I was pretty fine keeping this all bottled up for the past... almost 7 or so years now, but lately I've noticed my thoughts changing. It's really hard for me to write this. As I read it, is sounds so stupid and it makes these entire feelings seem trivial. In the beginning I was just one of those people that given a choice to have never existed, would've taken it. 

But lately I've noticed I've been actively wishing I were dead... I burst out crying regularly when any little thing goes wrong, and I've started neglecting my school work, and I'm pretty terrified of what's happening to me. I actually catch myself berating my happiness and convincing myself that I look like an idiot when I'm happy. Does anyone else do this?

I've always been deathly shy and keep to myself. Though I finally made some very good friends in high school, I lost them when my family moved across states in my last year of high school. My parents did it for the good of the family, but I resented them, and still do, for moving at that critical time.

But that was 3 or so years ago. I started college but I can't seem to move on. I can't make myself care about schoolwork anymore. I went from straight A's to straight C's and finally just started skipping all or most of classes. I've also tried to make friends, but most acquaintances and classmates admit they see me as someone who is conceited and prefers to be alone. I've tried hard to smile and be as friendly as I can, but I can't shake this perception. Anyway, time hasn't made this better, and it doesn't help that I *hate* admitting that I am so miserable.

My dad asked me if I was finally happy today, and I had to use every ounce of my willpower not to cry...again. A minute before he had asked me I had been thinking I just want to die...

Anyway, I'm just writing this to get it out I guess. No matter how much I'd really like to get life over with already, every single day is a chore. And my head hurts so much. But I like to pretend I'm holding back for my parents, because they'd be devastated, when maybe I'm hoping things will change.

But they haven't so far. And I really hate how stupid this all sounds when it's written out like this. ",16,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhhc2/just_want_to_get_this_out/,1269413273

I recently just came off a 4-5 year addiction to World of Warcraft (3 weeks clean after raiding 5-6 nights a week) and with that, I was wanting to focus on my uni work and get the grades I deserved -- as in previous semesters, I'd be 1-3 marks off getting into the next band (credit/distinction/highdistinction) and always getting bummed about it, and especially leaving things to the last minute because I prioritised WoW/video games over my uni work. The thing is, this all seems fine on paper; I'm also unemployed with no licence/car, which does bother me at times, and it could be a contributing factor as to why I feel like shit, but I'm not sure.

The point of this (and that made me write this in the first place) is the fact that I currently have programming assignments, in the same language as the industry standard, in the situation that if I nail these and do well, I could turn around and put it in my portfolio and start building myself up as a programmer so when I'm done at uni I can kickstart my career; and yet I feel like I should be excited to do it, because I'd get crucial experience in doing what I love. 

Well, thats the thing. I'm not sure anymore. I've spent the past 2 days procrastinating even though it's due in like 4 days. I seriously can't be bothered doing it, and it's been the same for every other programming assignment I've recieved in the past 2-3 years. I should be excited because this is what I've told people and what I've believed I want to do for the rest of my life, and yet I'm already predicting I'll be doing this up until the due date/hour.

I believe this is a main part of why I feel like shit, but lately I haven't really had the energy to do anything; yesterday I woke up relatively early (10-11), watched tv for a few hours, moped around on reddit/facebook/youtube for a few hours, watched more tv, ate food then went back to bed. This is pretty much how my days have been going, with the exception of dragging myself to uni 4 days a week; all the while I think I should be excited (or at least wanting) to do this uni work which is essentially what I'm aiming to do in a real company in just 2+ years from now.

Another contributing factor (I imagine): My uncle did Compuer Science, at the same university, and went on to travel across the world (australia -&gt; usa) to work at a highly prestigious company and I used to look up to him, thinking that I would complete my degree (maybe with honours) then look at making the same jump to work in such companies; however he recently passed away, which, to be quite honest, sucks. I wanted to sit down with him and ask him about life after uni in this field and everything (sadly; we weren't able to meet up IRL that much due to the whole ""other side of the world"" thing), and especially after going through the funeral and all that, and thanks to family/friends, I started to realise that I bare great resemblance to him, which makes it hard because the option of contacting him one way or another was there before, and I imagine I would have used that in great depth later on, but having that taken away makes it difficult.

I'm sorry if this is long, and seems a bit merit less compared to other people here, but I just want someone to tell me that it's kind of normal to experience this throughout uni/college. I haven't told anyone, and I'm starting to think my parents are thinking I'm just lazy, but I seriously can't be fucked doing anything anymore; I'm not sure if it's because I killed a 4-5 year WoW addiction cold turkey, or if it's the fact that my uncle passed away in which having him around could have helped me get through some of this, I don't know.

This might be a dead end, I'm not sure, but I'm hoping someone will read this and be able to help me.

bjg67,depression,itsfakenameyouknow,"I think I have found the source and or triggers for my depression, and I need your advice.","Right off the bat I will say the negative factor in my life is my father. So  here is the basic background story. I lived with my mother up until college and the divorce was before I can remember. Then for college I moved in with my father because he lives near my uni. Living with him isn't the worst thing ever. Read as: he doesn't beat me. He is gone during the week, but calls all the time to have me do  silly shit for him. On weekends he comes home and usually want some help with a project. I don't mind helping him, but he is very short tempered. Being 62 years old he is frugal, petty and just obnoxious. I feel sorry for him at many point because he is very angry at the world and there is no way I can help him. He blames other people for everything, and something rarely, if ever, his fault.  All he does is watch soccer and old tv shows. He is stuck in the 1970s.(Yes, i'm aware that it appears I am blaming him for my problems, but I am doing so with this explanation. And I am attempting a realistic portrayal of events. Plus he doesn't directly cause most problems, he just makes them worse with his outlook.)

Problems in life only really affect me more than normal when my dad is involved. Sometimes after an argument I will be so stressed and just have to cry or do something to distract myself and I can't get schoolwork done. He will be petty and overthink things which wastes my time. Plus i do not want to end up old, bitter, and friendless as he is. The only perk to living with him is that rent is free. I have been living with him for 2 years and it is getting slightly worse, although we were never really good at any point. Would I be better off getting a student apartment at ~$400 a month (Which I can probably afford, probably without taking out loans). Or should I suck it up, get over it, and hope he doesn't kick me out?

i'm pretty sure i'm depressed... just neutral. i don't know how to explain it.. but here goes: i don't like anything in my life right now, my friends, my degree, people in general actually. i don't think i'm full of  myself and my honest automatic reaction to people who annoy me is realization that people are different and that person and i just don't get along. i don't think i'm better but if i have to hang out with them for too long, i start gettign annoyed. this is mainly because i have no friends that i like. so i'm starting to think that it's me.. how is it possible that i don't feel comfortable around anyone and dislike most people? ..

theres more to it but my main point is that the only thing that i can actually do about it is get off the internet and kind of cold turkey start living life... but the overwhelming loneliness that awaits life without internet is just ... overwhelming. just thinking about it actually terrifies me..

bkcv7,depression,[deleted],How to deal when therapy and meds fail?,"Sorry for the wall of text, I need some advice. 24/M here and I am pretty much a living suicide. Four years ago, I dropped out of university, and dropped out of life. I wasn't doing particularly bad at school (not particularly well, either, although I was considered way above the curve, I was an underachiever) but the depression I had since middle school became much worse after a breakup. Since then I have more or less holed up in my parent's basement, where, I would have committed suicide a long time ago, but doing so, I believe, will literally kill my mother with grief, which would probably cause my father to commit suicide too. So out of consideration for them and a few (ex)friends, I didn't do anything... I didn't do much of anything for years. Played a whole lot of WoW, a lot of that time unguilded, which is the same as doing nothing. 

Not that I didn't try. A multitude of psychologists, psychiatrists, anti depressants, mostly all useless. Exercise too. I'd say only one psychologist out of the 7 or so was actually helpful, and even she gets the creeps from me nowadays. I'm not sure why, when all I wish is to be able to die alone. Anyways, the point is I feel like I have passed the point of no return. Even if I were to live to a ripe old age, I will have this crippling depression. 

I even tried to go back to school. For half a semester I was doing very well. Electrical engineering at a top5 school, and straight A's across the board, despite being a little rusty. I had the work ethic I was supposed to have my earlier years. Then depression catches up with me, and I finish with a sub 3.0 semester gpa (actually much lower, somewhat embarrassed), including a failing grade. Problem was probably that of no satisfaction. Scoring 100% on a test gives no satisfaction. Peers who regard me as a pimp or something (I'm not) or as a genius (maybe literally, but I wasn't that much brighter than them or anyone else) do as much for my self esteem as a wet carrot. A problem was my ex, with whom I still had feelings, and with whom I had started talking to a lot again, over msn messenger and email. A huge, huge mistake, since she always does drag me down to her level, and mess the fuck out of me, even thousands of miles away. For a little while, she did make me feel the best I had since we broke up. She's gone now... permanently this time. She gets creepy vibes from me too, which ruined what little self esteem I had left. 

So after that subpar performance at trying to return to life, I am back in here in the basement, watching time go by. Probably a normal, stable life with a career and a girlfriend can pull me out of this, but neither will come my way when I am an unattractive loser with no degree, no experience, no friends and bad social skills. I would like to, and I could go back to school, but I think I'll just fuck it up again. Because of my shallowness. Because it seems I live for two things: affirmation (read:paychecks and $) and love (read:sex) - or at least one. It certainly has been a long time since I've had either of those two things. Any passion I had, for my major and anything else, has died a long time ago. 

Does anyone else feel this way? At first, I thought it was just my school's understaffed, insufficient mental health clinic that was ill equipped to handle depressions of this magnitude, but lately I get that off campus resources don't really know what to do when therapy and drugs fail. I guess because most people with depression as severe and long term as this have already killed themselves, or are permanent inpatient cases. Or we don't talk about it, perhaps because of the futility of it.

Basically all of the advice given to the depressed boils down to, suck it up, take care of yourself, like yourself, let your emotions out, things will eventually get better, the glass is half full not half empty stuff. Do therapy and maybe meds, None of this is working well for me. I wonder if I am just really weak or if I have some severe neurological abnormality. Anyone know what's going on?

bkel1,depression,depressedsoul,I am so lost,"As far back as I can remember I have always been sad.  I may not have always looked sad or depressed because I spent most of my life living a lie.  I have always pretended to be fine, when deep down I was wallowing in misery.  I am 24 years old, and have been struggling with depression most of my life.  I feel as if every time I reach a peak from climbing out of depression, I fall down a valley.  The valleys seem to get deeper and deeper each time.  Each time I think I hit rock bottom, but now I feel worse than ever.  

I regret most of my life, and I am not at peace with almost anything I have ever done.  The only thing that I am happy with was preventing some random girl who I had just met from killing herself in front of me.  I felt her pain, and told her not to give up.  I loved her for the brief time I knew her and truthfully that was the only time I had a really deep connection with anyone.

I am so lost.  I have been living a lie for so long.  I have only been in school because that's where I thought I should be, but it's not where I want to be.   I want to backpack and travel but I feel as though I am going to destroy that path as I did with everything else.  The person that people think they know is also a lie.  I have been acting most of my life, and no one really knows me, they have only had peeks at who I am. 

If you feel like reading a lot, here is a bit of a backstory of my life:

Things took a turn for the worse when I was about 13.  My parents were constantly arguing as far back as I can remember, and my father was prone to smashing and breaking things during those fights.  Well one morning I awoke to screaming and banging. I told my younger sister to stay in the room while I went to assess the situation.  I immediately discovered my parents literally fighting, fists were flying.  My father proceeded to headbutt my mom, breaking her nose.  They immediately saw me standing there watching in horror.  My mother grabs me as she tells me to protect to her, that's the first time that I saw real fear in someone's eyes.  I tell my father to get the fuck out of the here and look at what you did.  I push him down my front stairs.

That day seemed to be the day that I became broken.  I was fractured in so many places and became disillusioned.  I realized that the world was such an ugly place.  Something inside of me began to change.  I began to act out on the ugliness, and I eventually came to actually enjoy it.  I gave up on excelling at school, while regularly stealing and vandalizing anything.  I began drinking at a young age even though my father was an alcoholic.  But none of this was internal, it was all an external reaction.  My real problems began to manifest with sex and masturbation.  By the time I was fifteen I had pretty much got off to every type of porn there was and frequenting perverse chatrooms.  When I wasn't destroying or stealing outside, I was destroying myself inside.  I had become a sex addict, and at the same time I hated myself for it.

I barely graduated high school due to barely attending.  I then grew a lump in my chest, which was later proved benign, and I thought it was breast cancer.  I hid it until it became excruciatingly painful.  After the surgery, I isolated myself to my room for a year and a half while playing an MMORPG and masturbating to all types of disgusting shit.  I eventually broke out and tried to reinvent myself.  I became more outgoing and started dating, each time I failed.  How could someone love me if I could not love myself?

I then enrolled in a local college, and at the same time became somewhat of a fitness freak.  With my newly obtained fit body, I began seeking random sex with people off of craigslist and adultfriendfinder.  While I was doing well at school, I spent the rest of my time seeking sex from anyone and everyone.  By the time I was 22, I had been with every gender, male, female, transguys and transgirls, and even couples.  None of it made me feel any better, in fact it made me feel even worse.

Over the course of a couple of months, I had two breakdowns.  Both times my body was acting on its own yelling random garbage while my consciousness was somewhere else.  The first time I was hospitalized because I broke into a random basement and punched through a window.  My friends later saw me running down the street with blood gushing down my arm.  I ""awoke"" tied down to a hospital bed, watching myself continue to yell random garbage until I regained control over myself.  To this day, I still try to remember what I experienced and the closest I can come to explaining it is that they were both similar to salvia trips that lasted hours.

I eventually transferred to a state college where my sex addiction took the backseat to drinking.  I became friends with heavy drinkers and partiers.  I was drinking almost everyday.  I then proceeded to get kicked off campus, and eventually failed out.

I moved back in with my parents and I began to hate them.  I realized they are nothing but overgrown children who should have never had a child, let alone three children.  I began to have panic attacks and was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder.  I was prescribed clonazepam and prozac but I didn't have health insurance and couldn't afford to keep up with the medication.  At the same time I developed a serious paranoia of people talking behind my back.  I thought I was becoming schizophrenic but I found out that my family thought I had a coke problem (I have only done coke twice in my life).  Eventually the panic attacks stopped, and I transferred to an art school while at the same time moving out of my parent's house.

I am now on a leave of absence from school, while seeking therapy.  I am now taking Celexa along with Clonazepam while diagnosed with Bipolar II.  My sex addiction is back, and I struggle with it everyday.  I am unemployed and I try hard to occupy myself with other tasks.  I read constantly but sometimes my thoughts become so overwhelming that I cannot concentrate.  I also have days where I spontaneously binge drink.  For the past two years I have been smoking weed regularly and to me it is the only thing that has kept me going.  When I am not high, I am agitated, depressed, angry and really sad.
I am writing all this now because I just broke down crying while I was in the shower.

tl;dr I basically lived a life of constant self loathing.  I am a sex addict who is known to use other substances as an escape.

And nothing happened. The experiment had failed. After half an hour (and cleaning up) i rejoined the party like nothing had occured at all. 

That was 2 years ago and i was just thinking about that. And i just came to the shocking conclusion: what if i had succeeded? I could have killed myself!

bl0bd,depression,[deleted],Depressed. No idea what to do with my life.,"My family is Russian. They came to America when I was very little unfortunately they moved around a lot. I was an extremely shy kid to begin with so I never made any friends. Around middle school my parents settled in Canada. Because of my mothers strong religious views and her wanting to shelter me from the world I was home-schooled.

I've always been sad. I always hid it and pretended like I was okay. I've wished that I were dead since I was around 10. My parents were so strict I just ended up hating them. My dad beat me every time I looked at him wrong. My mother would constantly tell me that I wasn't meant to be and ruined her life.

My family comes from a religion where women aren't supposed to go to school, have jobs or careers. When I was a kid I was always told that when I'd turn 18 some guy would marry me and we'd have a family and everything would be better. I started believing it.

Today, I am a 20 year old female. I live with my parents. I have no friends. I've never had sex or kissed a boy. I'm not very pretty and slightly over weight.

When I was around 15 I started building websites. I finally found something I was good at. It only lasted a year till I lost my creativity and I couldn't do it anymore no matter how much I wanted to.

I have no friends, absolutely none. I can't leave the house without my mother coming with me. I don't have a job. I don't have a GED or diploma. Last time I checked GED's cost money, money which I can't get because my parents think school is stupid.

My parents don't believe in medication. They say whatever comes naturally will go away naturally. I was on meds for a short period of time when I was much younger and they caused me to almost kill myself.

Every day of my life is the same. I don't start feeling depressed till around noon. By the end of the day it's so bad that I'll just cry myself to sleep and wish I didn't wake up in the morning. I feel completely worthless. I feel like a failure to my parents. I'm constantly weak and tired. I feel like the life is being drained out of me.

I sleep a lot. I play a lot of video games. I watch a lot of Television which sometimes makes me more depressed because of how pretty and perfect everyone is. (I know, I know, it's fake).

I have a boyfriend whom I met once in real life at a social event who lives in a different country. We have a long distance relationship and it sucks at times because we can hardly talk. When I met him I pretended to be someone else. Someone happy. When I finally told him about my depression I feel like he lost interest in me. We had a fight and he just told me to ""get help"" and broke up with me. We did get back together a few weeks later but I feel like he's different now. He is the only person I have and I can't talk to him about any of this. He will just change the topic. I realize that long distance relationships aren't the best thing because once he would get to know me in real life he wouldn't want me anymore so I'm just giving myself hope.

I don't know what to do. I'm tired of being like this. I want to move, get away from my family but I can't exactly do that without money which I can't exactly get without an education. No one will ever ""just marry"" me like my parents expect.

EDIT: I forgot to mention the last time I got a job was when I was 16. Both my parents approved but on my first day my mother came into my work place and dragged me home, kicking and screaming saying I didn't belong there. Embarrassed me in front of everyone.

I don't have that. I don't know why. I've tried hard to be a social person throughout college. I've met a great amount of people, but I never went past the acquaintance phase. The people I did choose to be my close friends are now complete degenerates who do nothing but play video games all day and all night. 

I want to desperately go out and socialize and meet new people, so I contact these friends who are in such tight-knit social circles. But when I join them, it just feels odd. They are so close with each other and have so many inside-jokes that I just don't feel welcome. I always get the feeling that I am just tagging along, and so I don't want to put any further pressure on these friends to bring me along.

This isn't so bad in the winter time, when it's shitty out and I'm studying all the time anyway. With the recent spring weather, however, it's unbearable. I go to a school in a big city, so as I walk down the street I just see a ton of people (all my age, or a little older) just having a grand old time. Drinking in the outdoor restaurants, holding hands, just having a great time. This kills me.

This reminds me of when I was graduating High School, when the same exact feelings came over me. I had made a lot of friends throughout High School, and throughout my Sophomore and Junior years but by Senior year it seemed like everyone became closer friends behind my back and I was just the constant outcast. I realize this isn't really true, but it's just how I feel. I can't explain it, but now I don't see any of my friends from High School anymore. I don't even bother, because I don't consider them friends. I don't enjoy my time with them.

The same can be said for the vast majority of people I've met in college. I never got to know them well enough (which is my fault) and so I don't know them well enough to have that close bond, and thus I can't share those warm, glorious feelings of the college days winding down.

All I have are close friends who play video games all day, who were not like this a year ago. This is what I come home to, and this is what I end up in the presence of. It takes a supreme toll on me, because it just makes me depressed. I don't even play video games with them, but I just feel immeasurably depressed. 

I feel lonely and unstable, and I have never felt this bad before in my life. I don't want to do anything at this point. I can't read anything, watch anything, smoke anything, eat anything, or talk to anyone. I don't know what to do. I may have depression, and I am considering talking to my Doctor about this but I can't see him until Monday. I also have exams this week which is freaking me out. 

I just don't know what to do, and I just want someone to talk to me. Anyone. Say something. Please. ",8,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bluzw/college_graduation_feeling_immeasurably_lonely/,1270263897
bmezg,depression,noself,Hear me out: I have no self worth and no self esteem. I essentially hate myself. What do I do here?,"Four years now I have been struggling with self esteem issues and how much I hate myself. I don't feel like I deserve anything. Being replaced by best friends is a recurring theme throughout my life, so I believe that has something to do with it. Recently, my parents found out about my self injury and this has made me feel even more worthless. They blame themselves and I am responsible. 

Everything about me I feel is insignificant and that this world would be better off without me. After contemplating suicide, though, I understand how selfish it is. My ex best friends dad committed suicide so I know the after effects there.

I have been going to a therapist and been put on both prozac and zoloft. They don't help. Soon, I am going to see a psychiatrist. I was ""diagnosed"" with depression but I honestly don't think that's the issue here. I think either my depression is caused by my lack of self worth, or that I have some other underlying issue.

Any advice? That's my situation in a nutshell, so if any other questions come up, please ask. Anything is appreciated... book suggestions, medicine suggestions, anything. Thank you!",6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bmezg/hear_me_out_i_have_no_self_worth_and_no_self/,1270422754

Here's what I noticed. When it hits, it always sucks, but it always ends (that's why I'm still here). So I've developed the mindset of ""waiting it out"" when I notice the symptoms coming in. And they come without warning: I can feel completely fine one day, and feel like shit the next.
But again, being depressed just sucks, and I am sick of seeing my productivity, motivation, and creativity just take erratic dips when I know I should be able to use my time more fruitfully, yet just can't get myself to care. I'd rather just rot away.
I have also learned to just try and distract myself, however uninterested I am, and that's why I'm on reddit. But I'm waiting for the feelings to subside.

bmzhl,depression,big_manjini,"Please, help.  I'm 28, depressed, and running out of hope.  I don't want to.","To start with, yes, there is going to be a lot of text.  I'm getting some stuff off my chest, but I also want to be as explicit as possible so that anyone who might have something relevant to share, no matter how small, can do it.  I realize I'm asking you a big favor in getting through this wall of text.  But I'd really appreciate it.  Only problem is that it's a super long typed up thing, so I apparently need to chop it into parts, so please refer to the comments for the rest of it.

The summary is this: I'm a 28 year old virgin, relatively successful, relatively in shape, who has plenty to look forward to and still has things he enjoys in life, but who is losing a battle against a crippling inferiority complex and the resulting depression.

My best theory for the origins of my issues are as follows:  I grew up in the rural midwest in a town of about 1,000 people.  My family was something of a local dynasty with a reputation, established over several generations, of being handsome local sports stars.  I realize now how meaningless it sounds to be a small town sports hero, but the world I grew up in felt a lot smaller.  In a town of 1,000 people, being a local sports star is about as close to celebrity as you can get.  The signs welcoming you to town proudly list all the years we managed to take state championship in each sport.  Ask anyone in town about their home team, and their chest would swell with pride as they recounted tales of battles won against schools ten times our size to bring the state championship home again.

One of my uncles was a 3 time state champion wrestler and set several records at the state level in football.  My father was similar athletically successful and had since become assistant coach of the hometown wrestling team.  These men, among others, started off a new generation of the Dynasty with a bang: though I had no brothers, I had plenty of cousins -- there were six other boys within four years of age of me who shared my family name.

Most of those boys grew to fulfill the family reputation nicely.  It started with blue ribbons in pee-wee wrestling and ended with year after year of state championships in football.  All across the state these strapping young lads had the heart of many a high school girl wrapped around their finger, a couple of them so remarkably handsome that it wasn't uncommon to catch out of town girls giggling over them as though they were the cover to Tiger Beat.  This newest generation of the Dynasty seemed to be the best one yet. 

And as you likely already guessed, I didn't exactly fit in with these other six.  It's not that we weren't close -- we were a tight knit family.  We grew up together, I was exceptionally close to most of them, and they are still among my best friends.  But as we grew older they took to sports pretty naturally and were celebrated by the entire town and family.  They were also nice guys overall, polite and well behaved.  They were even multi-talented and excelled in band and choir, taking home state awards regularly.

I, on the other hand, had interests elsewhere. I did sports to fit in, but never enjoyed it much (and sometimes flat out wanted to quit).  I also did music, and genuinely enjoyed that, but I never had the natural talent for it my cousins did.  I was much more interested in computers, technology, video games, public speaking, acting, storytelling, and fantasy novels.  At some of these things I excelled -- in grade school I was teased for my insatiable appetite for all things Nintendo, in high school I had a reputation as the go-to computer guy and my typing speed seemed to be a novelty to my peers.  But I was rather homely in appearance and sometimes outright embarrassing at sports, and it wasn't long before my ""black sheep"" reputation proceeded me.

I want to stress that while teenagers could be cruel about it, my family most certainly wasn't.  I never got on all that well with my father, but it wasn't because he was cruel to me.  It's just that we had no common ground -- he was born and raised a farmer in a small town, and he was content in everything that life had to offer.  He enjoyed the home town sports games and watching football on sunday.  He believed in hard work and the character of manual labor and being in the sun.  I honestly had very little interest in sports and wanted to instead by spending every moment I could in front of the computer.  He hated to see me in front of the computer.  And so I grew up being afraid of getting ""caught"" using the home computer (after we were able to afford one of our own, anyways).

That's all getting a little off course -- the point is that I grew up relatively happy, but unsurprisingly developed a kind of inferiority complex.  Though a few girls showed interest in me in my younger days, it never amounted to anything more than making out, and I always felt out of place in my own family through no fault of their own.  And so when I entered college in 1999, it was as an insecure, poorly dressed, and not particularly attractive computer science major.  I wish I could say I got out of my family's shadow, but that's not true either -- during my four years of higher education, five of those six cousins were playing college ball for my college or one nearby.

bn3jj,depression,GunThreatHead,I use the idea of suicide as a mental trick,"I am a male, mid-20s, UK. Suffered  for depression with cyclical severity since my mid-teens. Been attending group therapy for the first time since the start of this year.

I catch myself thinking about suicide in moments of stress or even slight frustration. These thoughts take several different forms. Sometimes if I'm faced with an obvious problem I will think to myself ""look, it doesn't matter; you can just kill yourself"", when I *should* be thinking ""look, it doesn't matter; it'll all work itself out."" Suicide is the focus of my *hope*. 

I've recently caught myself calming down by imagining someone has a gun placed at the back of my head.

tl;dr: I seem to think of dying as something comforting; to look forward to; and the solution to my problems.

Does anyone else do the same? Anyone care to offer some advice or analysis?

bnymr,depression,swirling,Should I tell someone that can't help me how I feel?,"
I'm suicidal to the point that I wouldn't be surprised if I was gone within the next few weeks.  Now I have a friend I've met a few times before, but we mostly communicate online.  We're mostly internet friends because we live an hour apart in different cities.

They've picked up on the fact that I'm depressed.  I'm not that subtle when I'm feeling especially down.  I don't know if I should tell them how I feel.  My common sense tells me that I shouldn't put them through any of this in case I do commit suicide.  It seems incredibly self-centered, but I don't have anyone to talk to which makes it very tempting.

I think I've answered my own question, but I'll leave it up to reddit.

bo3pt,depression,FluffyBunnikins,I need to seek help (UK) and I'm not sure where to start.,"I'm male, 26 and I've been depressed for as long as I can remember.

There are many reasons for this - I'd like to believe that these are all to do with the many years of severe emotional abuse I've had to deal with, but it's possible that there is more to it.

I have very rarely sought help, in any fashion. Certainly no-one would help me when I was younger. The most important event was almost two years ago, when I finally went to see a GP.

He was incredibly rude, did not listen at all, kept interrupting my sentances and telling me that there was nothing wrong with me - essentially that I was wasting his time.

That spun me out for a few months, and I've only started to bring up enough courage to try something like that again.

Since then my unhappiness and lack of basic social ability (such as making eye contact - it physically hurts on occasion) has cost me jobs and relationships, the last of those was two days ago, when a girl I love more than anything, and I've been seeing for almost a year, suddenly told me she doesn't want to see me again, as my occasional bouts of misery were making her even more miserable. I'm also due to be made redundant in a couple of months, and I'm worried that I won't be able to land a new job, since I come across so appallingly in interviews.

I honestly don't know where to go for help. I don't have a lot of money, and I'm very against the idea of medication (again, for a lot of reasons, some of them historical). If going to a GP is going to be anything like as painful as before, then I  don't think I can stand it.

I don't think I'm a suicide risk. The thought of it has always been there, but it's more comforting than anything - it's a possible exit when there doesn't seem to be any, so it can be put aside and other options can be considered.

What are my options? I'm finding it very hard to think straight right now, obviously, and I've never done this kind of thing before.

On my way home from school, a group of high school seniors decided to pick on me, and I got beat up. Then I got home, and my dropbox stopped working. I contacted support to see what happened, and they told me that someone reported me for spamming. I'VE NEVER EVER SPAMMED IN MY LIFE. I'm almost positive it was one of the kids at school who pick on me all day. I've already been depressed at home because of family issues, but I'M SO TIRED OF THIS. All of my schoolwork was saved in dropbox, and I was too dumb to make a backup. And to top it all off, I had about 8 GB of space from referrals that it took me almost a year to get and now my account is cancelled. I created a new dropbox account but ALL of my extra space is gone, and I'm reduced back to 2 GB. I can't afford the full plan, and I have a long distance group of friends who rely on dropbox for me to send them certain video files (we make youtube videos). I worked hard for a year to convince people to install dropbox from my referrals, and all my work was useless because of some jerk who decided it would be funny to mess with the one good thing I have going in my life. ALL my schoolwork is gone. My ONLY source of fun is gone because I can't upload big files to dropbox anymore. I'm just so sick and tired of everything. I've always been picked on in school, but now my dropbox, which had my entire life is gone, and I don't have enough storage to do anything anymore. I mean, I'm only a sophomore in high school and my life already sucks. I just don't see hope for the future. I'm punished for things I didn't do, and it's incredibly annoying. I'm not suicidal, but I just need help. I don't know where I'm going to get referrals now to make my storage quota higher because the few people I know already have dropbox, and I don't know how to get people to be nice. 

EDIT: Thanks guy's you've really been a help to me. I've read through all your comments, and they've really made me feel better. I did an online search, and I found an alternative to dropbox so I feel much better now. Thanks for your help :)

EDIT 2: I noticed some of you are suspicious that this is some technique to get more storage space, but I promise that this isn't some sick ploy for referrals on dropbox.

br4by,depression,Soupstorm,"I'm lost in a haze, I'm almost always sad, and I think I have PTSD.","I've made too many cry-for-help posts across the Internet to pull that shit anymore. So instead, here are some facts about my situation.

My dad passed away in June 2006 from cancer, two weeks before my final highschool exams. He was diagnosed with stage IV (terminal) colon cancer on November 1st 2005, the day before my 18th birthday. I was never very close with him, but it hit me hard. I had gone back for a fifth year, re-taking all my final courses, only this time I was actually going to apply myself and get the marks I deserved so I could go to the university I wanted to. I was getting 95 in Calculus up until the end of October. Beginning exactly on November 1st, I stopped doing my work.

So, it's almost four years later. From fall 2006 to now, I have been to college twice, and dropped out twice (first in March second term, then in December first term), both times due to diagnosed clinical depression. I was on Zoloft for four months. I have worked five different jobs. I moved out with my friends and lived in an apartment for ten months. I went to an adult high school for three months, and lived with my grandparents during that time. I played a lot of videogames. I had two internet relationships (each lasting three months) and two real-life relationships (each lasting nine). This entire four-year stretch is a haze. Days, even weeks, blur together. There are whole months where I don't remember what I did.

Prior to my dad's diagnosis, I remember almost nothing about my life. This isn't the normal ""aw, my childhood memories are fading, I miss them :("" kind of reaction. I mean that I remember a handful of ""scenes"" that took place in my life. I remember being five years old, learning how to use a yo-yo in my driveway. I remember accidentally punching my friend really hard in the stomach after school on the climbers. I remember a couple instances of playing videogames with my friends, from grades 5 to 11. Aside from that... nothing. Whole people seem to have disappeared from my memory. Games I played, stories I read, conversations I had, things I learned. Gone. I remember that I watched Reboot and Pokemon a lot as a kid. But I can't remember any of the episodes. I used to be able to recall whole episodes of any show I cared to watch, line-for-line, the day after I watched them. I can't do that anymore. I played Pokemon Yellow on an emulator, one of my favourite games of all time, one that I held very dear to me as a child, and I felt nothing.

I can't connect to anyone these days. Friendships that used to elicit deep, amusing conversations, now feel like distant, listless phone conversations in prison visiting rooms. My siblings rarely talk to me, even though we live in the same house (I do admit this is my ""fault"" for endlessly receding into my personal space). I don't let anyone in anymore. I *can't*. I didn't even like my dad, but now it's like I'm afraid that everyone will disappear just like he did.

I think my version of ""happy"" is nothing more than a stupor. When I feel sad or anxious, the minutes drag on and on. My stupor only makes me feel happy by comparison; calm and relaxed. Empty and without thought. Because when I think, I remember why I stopped in the first place. I remember how lonely I am, how I can't remember my childhood, how I can't concentrate or learn something new or care the slightest bit about anything that I think won't immediately and definitely result in a positive boost to my psychological health.

Before I forget: Yes, I smoke weed. But I didn't start until ten months after my dad died, and I didn't smoke regularly until about two years ago. I have also cut down on my intake lately, and will cut down further, as I need to save money for university in the fall. And when I smoke, I never feel paranoia or anxiety.

So with all that said, I am at the same loss I've been since this all started. I'm strongly considering returning to my therapist, though when I was with her I felt more like a research subject than a person receiving therapy. I'm also strongly considering taking LSD or psilocybin shrooms as a therapeutic aid. I acknowledge the inherent psychological risks, but I would rather connect with myself than nothing at all.

So yeah. That's where I am right now. I don't have a concluding statement.

[edit] Also, I never laugh anymore, at least not honestly. I recognise and acknowledge humour, insofar that it matches patterns of humour that I used to react to. Now I just force a laugh. I can't remember when I made this transition.

[edit2] I've also noticed that I no longer have an internal monologue. This makes it extremely difficult to internalise anything I read. When reading stories, I am unable to attach faces, voices, or personalities to characters or dialogue.

Girls dont seem to like me, and I'm not gay at all, not that there's anything wrong with that. So i feel like im just going to go through life alone.

3. College just drags on. I already failed out once, and had to get back in 2 years later, I'm only a junior yet I've been in college for 5 years. I try hard to learn, yet barely pass my classes with a shitty grade, I study computer science btw. I dont want to retake them cause I just want to get the fuck out of there.

bsqy2,depression,[deleted],So here I am again ... ,"I have suffered from depression since I was a kid (it's not normal for an 8 year old to think of suicide). I have always felt less worthy than other people. I have never liked myself. I have never had a real friendship even as a kid. I remember my mom writing letters to the teacher telling her I have nobody to play with because I told her crying I'm always alone. I spent my first years of high school hanging out with my older brother's friends, they were not my friends (I almost didn't talk with them) but I least I wasn't alone. The next years I was heavily bullied (never physically though) and my depression became even worse than before. I was put on therapy and Paxil. I became a completely different person the last two years of high school while on Paxil. I still didn't have friends but at least I kind of socialized. Later I friended a girl who was similar to me, we eventually started dating and my depression disappeared so I stopped taking Paxil. We both went to different colleges (college is different around here, you normally live at home). I started my first semester and had excellent grades (3.9 GPA). She was my girlfriend and my only friend and I was pretty much the same for her. Then she started making friends at college. I didn't make any friend. She eventually dumped me (we lasted two years, she always said I was the best bf ever) for some bullshit reason and I was left alone again. I spiraled back into depression, my grades next semester suffered greatly (two Cs, two Bs and an A). My grades this semester are even worse and I have no friends or anyone to be around whatsoever. I come back to an empty home every afternoon to browse reddit, my parents come late at night. I was put on Paxil again and it's not working the same way it did the first time. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't see why I should continue living. I feel like a load to my parents. Two days ago after a talk with my ex when she told she doesn't want anything to do with me was the first time I contemplated suicide. I'm sure I won't do it, for my parents and because I'm too much off a pussy. I miss my ex, she was literally everything I had ... I have my parents too but I'm 20, I can no longer depend on them ...

bsxa0,depression,depressorz,Where to start?,"I Posted this on /r/AskReddit but it seems it got caught in the spam filter.  Then I found this subreddit, and figured cross posting might be a good idea.

So first thing first. This is a throwaway because I know a bunch of friends who read reddit. I know, there are threads like this multiple times a month, this is more for me to get my thoughts down and to give myself motivation to follow thru (feel free to downvote this as another sorry person if you want).

So I'm not sure where to start here. For pretty much as long as I can remember I've been a fairly unemotional person for lack of a better term. Don't get me wrong, I'll go out of my way to help people and I have some good friends, but day to day things that other people would enjoy just don't phase me at all. Many days, I would rather sit at home alone then be bothered to go out with my friends. I'm really reserved, and for the most part have lost all my motivation.

Today for an example, I slept in late because I had nothing to do. When I finally got up, I did nothing all day. I pretty much stared blankly ahead of me, and slept. I was able to get enough motivation to play a game for a few hours, but really that's it.

Don't get me wrong, I know I have things to be happy about. I just have a hard time bringing myself to actually be happy about them. I have a good job in a shitty economy, I have a house (I live alone, so its a bit lonely), friends and just recently started dating an awesome girl. Maybe she's the reason I'm finally bringing this all up, I don't know. She tells me all these awesome stories, and things she did during the day, and I feel like I'm missing out because this has hit me so hard lately. I feel like I have nothing important to tell her about.

In the past, I've been able to manage it with some activities. Going to the gym, a few sports, etc. But at some point, I always hit a spot where I just stop caring about those as well. Ultimately I end up back where I am now.

So here is my question to reddit: Where do I start to get myself back on track? I've got good health insurance, but I don't actually have my own doctor. Should I just go see a general practice Dr? Has anyone around here had good results going on meds for it?

Looking back on things recently, I truthfully want to get over this. I don't really care the cost. I want some motivation, I want to get this all taken care of. I just don't know where to start, so any info is helpful info.

tl;dr: Lost all motivation, don't care about most things. Pity Party looking for some help.

btt0v,depression,fauxaccount,This feels like the death of the rest of my life. Needing  advice desperately,"For whatever reason (it runs in my family, I'm 470lbs, lazy, lonely) I suffer from severe depression. 

Earlier this year I had a two week long spell of extreme depression where I stayed confined to my bed 95% of the time and suffered from suicidal thoughts for the last half. Prior to that I was constantly depressed for about a month. I made the biggest step and asked my mother for help and I went to see a doctor who put me on some meds which seemed to work perfectly. I felt ""normal"" for a long amount of time, like my old self. Blah Blah Blah, I asked for a mg increase due to the depression monkey slowly creeping up but everything went fine.

Sadly, during that time I was depressed and in bed I missed a ton of class and a tests. I basically am failing 3 classes out of 5. I decided to wait to drop them because It would mess up the $1300 coming in from a student loan

Fast-forward to now. Some crappy stuff happened in my life and I fell into a pit of despair and stayed in-doors for a week or more. The bank I went with had a HORRIBLE website, and after dealing with tech support multiple times I finally was successful in transferring my loan meaning I could drop those classes.

The timing is the worst. The deadline to drop classes is past and I have no idea what to do. The deadline was last week while I was struggling with my depression.

I seriously have no idea what the fuck to do. I feel like my entire future is ruined. My GPA is going to plummet and I don't know how I can possibly bring it up to go to a university. I feel like because of this one mistake my entire future is being flushed down the toilet.

 I am going to try and email the registrar or a counselor to see if I can have it dropped to extraneous circumstances but I don't know if they will let me. I don't know what to tell them, I doubt they will by sympathetic to my depression.

I feel like I have failed life and I am about to break down in tears for the first time in years. I don't understand how I can fuck up this badly and I don't know how to fix it.

**tl;dr** Unable to drop classes due to severe depression. Now have three 0s on my gpa and the deadline has passed to drop them. I need advice because I feel like my future is ruined.

**EDIT**: I decided to admit my failure to my mother who I still live with. I am going to the doctor to see if I can get on better medication, and get a doctor's note. She told me I was being foolish and it wasn't the end the world and stuff like this happens all the time.",16,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/btt0v/this_feels_like_the_death_of_the_rest_of_my_life/,1271801074
btx8v,depression,puddlesandpoodles,"I don't know if I'm depressed, I just want some answers","Hi. This is a throwaway account. I'm a freshman in college, I just turned 19 a few days ago, and I think I'm depressed but I don't really know if I am. Several people have told me but I need more answers.

Here's my situation, boiled down into a nifty little bullet pointed list (because typing everything out makes no sense when I read it back):

-I am 1700 miles away from home for the first time in my life.

-I am not ready to be an adult and I am terrified of becoming one right now.

-I feel very abandoned by my friends, who don't make any effort to contact me. I feel like no one gives a shit about me anymore. Sometimes I think, ""God I could be dead right now, and my family would be the only people who care.""

-I feel like I have no identity anymore. I don't have anything I really enjoy doing anymore, and no positive personality traits to fall back on.

-Whenever I am alone, I often feel sad and lonely. Like I wish people would talk to me. On the flip side, I spend most of my time holed up in my room because I am unmotivated to do anything, really.

-I am really self-critical and often find myself telling myself lies to convince myself people don't like me, which distances me from everyone.

-College is putting the pressure on to choose a lifestyle and I have no idea what I want to do with my future and it's scaring me. I don't have any direction, it feels like, and I am drifting without a purpose or reason besides living.

-Projecting even to next year, I can't see myself being happy. At all. My birthday was two days ago. I wasn't looking forward to it at all, but normally I do. I feel hopeless, like there is nothing I will be able to do and be happy doing it. I feel like I'm not very good at anything anymore.

-I have a lot of trouble communicating with people. It feels like no one really understands what I'm going through. The few people I do talk to about this offer advice that can't help me. I can't see much optimism anymore. I still try my hardest to smile and make jokes but when I'm alone, everything comes rushing back and I can't stop feeling sad.

I feel like this isn't depression because I don't have much of a reason to be. I had a great childhood, have had very little trauma in my life, come from a good background and loving parents and have, up until this point, had an awesome life. Now I feel very little anymore. Things still make me happy, but I am just so sad most of the time, I can't help wondering. At least 6 people have told me I might be depressed, and my parents even agreed with me. The counseling center here at school thinks so too and has even suggested medication to make me feel less anxious and sad but I'm just not convinced yet.

What do you think, Reddit? Do you think I have depression? What do you recommend I do? I'm desperate for answers.

Thank you so much for your time. It means a lot to me. Also sorry for the wall of text. It wasn't supposed to be this way! :(

bubik,depression,merrythoughts,I am on my 9th day of taking Prozac (fluoxetine)... I have some questions about it.,"First off, I'm an RN, so I've already accessed all the resources I can get my hands on.  I just want to hear real people's ideas and experiences.

Background: I've been feeling unwell for eight months now, with nothing showing up on diagnostic tests. I started feeling depressed and hopeless, as I'm only 26 and have always felt very healthy and energetic. This has been stressful for my husband, family, and me.  I had urges to run away from it all. I also have had general anxiety-- getting some panic attacks here and there, but mostly just always ruminating  about my mystery illness and wondering, ""am I dying from some obscure cancer?""

Current problem: I got a 'script for Prozac, and I started taking it. I am a over one week into it, and I have had terrible paresthesia of my feet/ankles the last four days. When I walk too long, my toes tingle, but when I lay down  in bed, I have **hot, stabbing pain**.  This has kept me from sleeping the last three nights, and my anxiety has sky-rocketed.  I had a Dr. appointment to talk about the paresthesia, but, ended up having the *worst* panic attack ever right there in the waiting room.  Embarrassing, and plus, I fear that it invalidates my whole health history, as the doctor will now brush all my symptoms off as being part of my anxiety. (I realize this is a possibility, but I want to keep checking things off the list.) He gave me my first prescription ever of Xanax and has me coming in to do some lab work tomorrow.

Questions:
1)Anybody else experience paresthesia (tingling, prickling, numbness) in the legs or arms after beginning an SSRI? 
2) Anybody else have a major increase in anxiety after beginning an SSRI?
3) If so, did these side effects go away after a few days, or did they persist?
4) I was prescribed both Lexapro and Prozac, as I wanted to chose which one I started after doing my own personal research.  I chose Prozac, as the side effects didn't seem as severe.  Has anybody had a good experience with Lexapro? Or, a good experience with switching from Prozac to Lexapro? 

I realize paresthesia, increased anxiety, etc can indeed be side effects, but, I'm trying to figure out if I should stay on it and see what happens, or get off it entirely, or try Lexapro instead.  I'm not sure if my mood/irritability has improved since being on Prozac yet, as I've been too anxiety ridden to know. 

So...those who have a history with SSRIs, I would love some insight with your personal experiences.

Thank you!

**tl;dr- what were your side effects from taking prozac/lexapro/other SSRIs?**


**Edit**: I took a Xanax, and the paresthesia is gone, which is good news.  I'm thinking that Prozac might just be exacerbating my anxiety way more than the average individual..",24,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bubik/i_am_on_my_9th_day_of_taking_prozac_fluoxetine_i/,1271887999

buziz,depression,[deleted],A question to people who have overcome their depression.,"A little background info on where this question stems from. 

I've had depression for a number of years now and have only once tried to do anything about it. I went to a psychiatrist and was put on Prozac. I started taking it and after a few weeks I started to feel genuinely happy. I wasn't just wallowing in a ball of self misery for the first time in my life. I felt optimistic about the days coming... and this scared me. Even though I was happy, I was longing for the feeling of depression that I had become so accustomed to. I assume that I had made depression my 'comfort zone' and I wanted to keep it that way. I quit taking the drugs and for the next few years just did nothing but be depressed which lead to me being a complete hermit. That's another story though. Today I started taking the Prozac again to hopefully help get my life in order and deal with my anxiety and depression. As weird as it may sound, I actually *like* being depressed. I just feel more of myself when I'm completely down and I usually put on music that increases the feelings of depression. 

What I want to know is, have any other Redditors that have started taking something for their depression felt uncomfortable being happy and wished to be depressed again? If so how were you able to overcome those feelings?

I switched from Wellbutrin XL 300mg to Wellbutrin SR 200mg (twice a day) - I think I was doing pretty good on the XL, life seemed to be OK for the first time. 6 or so months in, I (and my entire family) lost our job and I had to switch to SR because it wasn't supported by their freebie plan for low/zero income. The next 6 months were absolute misery. I'd wake up and be kind of okay, then after taking the SR the day would go downhill, sometimes I spent the whole day in a suicidal fugue and my brain would turn every little detail into something that just made me wish I didn't exist anymore.

I tapered off the SR 6 months ago and haven't been on anything since, and now I'm back at step 1, but with 1000% more stress than what I started out with.

**D**oes this make any sense? Did I build a reaction to the bupropion or is there enough of a difference between the XL and SR that could have caused my reaction?

bvljn,depression,MentalHealthPatient,Does anyone here have any experience with Topamax or Remeron?,"One of them seems to be making me dumb. I'm on a host of other medications, but I seem to be misspelling words left and right since I was started on these two medications.

I tried overdosing, failed, and then went to an inpatient program for a little under two weeks. I was started initially on Trazodone, Topamax, and a some other medications because I had depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and that attempt. The Trazodone was a wonder with my insomnia, which I had struggled with puberty. Unfortunately, it fucked with me heavily in the morning. To the point of me not being able to walk properly. In fact, I fell so hard that I sprained my ankle. So, the psychiatrist took me off of it and put me on Remeron instead.

I feel should give you a full rundown of the meds on right now, but Topamax and Remeron are the main two, but Adderall is a big contributor too:

* Topamax 100mg/night
* Remeron 30mg/night
* Adderall 40mg/day 20mg/afternoon
* Ambien 10mg or 20mg/night
* Hydrochlorothiazide (Blood pressure med/diuretic) 25mg/day
* Prilosec 20mg/day


So basically, I'm wondering if anyone else has had experience with either of these meds. I know it isn't the Adderall, HCTZ, Prilosec, or Ambien. I've been on all of those meds besides the Ambien in the past, and none of them have given me trouble with my cognition. In fact, Adderall makes me smarter than when I don't take it. Ambien doesn't seem to impair any cognitive functions after usage, so that can't be it.

Information seems to be light on the net for either of these meds. I get the feeling it's the Topamax, given that it seems to be called ""_Dopamax_"" on forums. I've discussed it with my psychiatrist, but he seems to think it's all it's just in my head. I think that's bullshit. I won a state spelling bee when I was in 11th grade, so when I just misspelled the word ""bee,"" I think there is something wrong.

Any experience or comments you have to share?

bwwbz,depression,[deleted],Should I try to go on an SSRI?,"I'm trying not to post too much of a wall of text, so I'm hopeful you'll have the time to read my background/situation.

I'm a PhD student in the UK, 1st year and in a science subject (funded for 3 years, will probably take 3-4 years to complete). I feel as if I've been struggling with depression for ages. I come home and almost never have the energy to do anything. What's worse, I frequently have little energy in the day either. This is partly a motivation/procrastination issue, but when my mood lifts I find everything so much easier.

I've tried to find a way out of this on my own for something like a year now. I've kept a diary for the past 4 months or so and it makes depressing reading. My average productivity is terrible. Every week or two I look at how sucky my life is, how pathetic I'm being and try to turn it around with the usual stuff - more social contact, better food, more exercise etc. It fails every time. I feel forced to conclude that enacting positive lifestyle change on my own just isn't working for me.

I comfort eat awfully (thankfully I'm not at all overweight). e.g. I could come home and eat 2x225g packets of Doritos to make myself feel better. I sit around at the computer all evening reading reddit and watching rubbish TV shows, which I don't even find enjoyable after 0.5-1 hours. I don't cook food because I'm too anxious about bumping in to other people in the shared kitchen. I don't have a friendship group, but I can at least converse with my officemate about tech related things.

This morning, I felt a little better. I felt motivated. I could think about achieving things over the next few weeks. I could imagine coming home and doing something fun (I can't even motivate myself to turn on a computer game at the moment...). I wish I could feel something like this most days, and was wondering whether the /r/depression community thought SSRIs might be at all helpful to me? I've avoided seeing the doctor up till now because I can only possibly face going in the times when I feel better for a short while. But then I convince myself that this time, unlike all the others, I can handle it myself. I realise it's not going to fix things for me, but what I've been trying up till now has had zero success and I'm getting desperate. I've been a bit put off by the horror stories. My biggest fear is ending up in a state worse than I am now, and more damaging to my PhD.

So,  Let me start of by saying that I know the basics of bipolar disorder (AKA Manic Depression Syndrome).  I know that there is a state in which the ""patient"" feels manic (happy, excited, full of energy), a normal state, and a depressive state.  I'm currently seeing a girl, 25 years old, who has been diagnosed with it.  Now I know she has this and I would never run from it, but sometimes my efforts to help with her depressive states seem to be ineffective.  For instance, currently she is not talking to me, she is staying off the radar as they say and will not communicate with me.  One of the last things she told me was that she had a million things tumbling around in her head and she just needed time to figure things out.  I'm scared.  Both that she will leave me and that there is nothing that I can do for her.  What is the best approach?  Do I sit back and wait for her to contact me. Do I try to tell her that everything is going to be fine?  I'm just really confused because this ""depression"" literally showed up within hours of seeing her last and she was just fine.

byvph,depression,Knulp,I have no direction in life.,"At this stage with most of my peers graduating from college in the next few weeks I feel as if I am the only person I know who has yet to do something meaningful. The fact is that I have no idea how to succeed. I have tried twice to attend university with no success both times resulting in full withdrawal, along with a litany of other failures. My upbringing was mired with more of the same failure and at this point I don't see anyway of turning my life around. 

My parents made me believe that I was bound for success my entire childhood but never once showed that they loved or cared for me, unless I was successful, and now with overwhelming feelings of failure encroaching as the day nears were everyone I have known throughout my life accomplishes their goals I am stuck wondering what my life could have been had I not been such a fuck up. 

I have been depressed most of my teenage years up until now and this is the darkest I have ever felt. The culmination of years of isolation from society which I have longed to be a part of but never managed to network myself into and the immense sense of shame and failure have lead me to a crux were I see that all of my hopes have been crushed. 

At this stage I have no idea what to do, I understand that it is not hopeless and I have not exhausted all of my options but I feel the alternatives to be too soul crushing to pursue.",9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/byvph/i_have_no_direction_in_life/,1272756750

bz275,depression,matmus,"Clinical depression, maybe anxiety.  Need some opinions.","So I've was diagnosed with clinical depression about 6 months ago.  I was given wellbutrin sr 100mg, now I'm on wellbutrin xl 150 mg.  Unfortunately depression and social anxiety runs pretty deep in my family, my great grandmother committed suicide before my dad was even born.  My uncle is nearly crippled by social anxiety, sees a therapist, takes medication, and works night-shift jobs in order to be away from any group of people.  So it's very possible I'll be dealing with depression my whole life.  Lovely.  Anyhoo.

So I've heard wellbutrin makes anxiety worse, and for some reason I always coupled my social anxiety with my depression.  I have a doctors appointment this week to talk about this, but I wanted to hear from others.  Essentially I want to know if it seems like I do have anxiety problems too.  This was part of my post in the ""what does depression feel like"" thread in AskReddit.  
""I knew I was depressed when I would wake up on the weekends at noon (which is normal with my body rhythm for reference, when I naturally wake up) and just roll back over and sleep. Wake up again, force more sleep. Usually till 4. Sometimes to 6, because I just couldn't find any reason to get up. I had things to do, but I didn't care. I probably wouldn't have gotten up at all except my girlfriend would call wanting to go get something to eat. And I felt my roommate was judging me, though he gave no sign. I'm naturally shy, and not much of a people person, which I like actually, and I think my depression expands upon this, to the point I think everyone can see my every fault; see into the depths of my very soul, and they think I'm worthless, a waste of talent. I wish I didn't care what everyone thinks. And in reality I don't. I'm projecting my own negative views of myself onto others, and yet, knowing this, I still feel like everyone is judging me. And so I want to curl up in bed, so that no one can judge me. And play music, what used to allow an escape. Yet I have a roommate, so I can't escape that feeling of being judged. I can't play music, because he is also a musician, and I feel he will judge my music and find me worthless. I can't take action because I can't let anyone else form an opinion. I will never have a roommate again, it fuels the depression.""  

Essentially I don't like meeting or spending time with (new) people.  I need to get a pianist for Double Bass juries, and I've haven't yet because I don't want someone to hear me play and judge my playing.  I haven't made a single new friend in college.  Though it turns out I did pick the wrong college, I hate the classes and (most) people here.  Now as I mentioned I'm naturally shy.  I don't like parties, or large social events, I find them to be pointless.  This is normal and okay in my eyes.  On the other hand I currently started taking Choy Li Fut and Tai Chi classes, so I'm not completely afraid of new things.  I'm just not sure where the line is between normal and anxiety.

bzk2k,depression,matmus,Explaining Depression to Your Family,"So I'm wondering if anyone has stories or advice about explaining depression to their family and loved ones.  Essentially I've been at college for a year, but for a variety of reasons and generally bad genetics I fell into a deep depression and basically wasted the year (as far as academics are concerned).  However, I did learn a lot about myself; what I truly want, what I need, and how to cope with depression.  I'm a lot better now (though still not where I would like to be).  I was also diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome.  Essentially my body is hard wired to a 4 am to noon sleep schedule, and I can't do a lot about it.  Although I tell my parents this, they seem convinced that if I just ""kept a strict sleep schedule""  it would fix itself.  I also have no idea how to explain why I wasted an entire year.  I already feel really bad about, understand the implications, and understand the money that was wasted.  However that was my money, so that isn't anything for them badger me about.  How can I explain how depression affects a person so I don't feel like crap all summer while they give me speeches and I mumble lame excuses about where the year went?

bzopk,depression,splashit,"Hey reddit, what's going on with me?","Throw away. Here's lists of things I feel like are problems.

I feel like I was depressed in high school, but got over it completely in college. However, for the last few months I notice that my mood fluctuates all the time, and often for little good reason. I can be the happiest person around one minute, and then suddenly fall into a mopey stupor that takes a night's sleep to get out of. I don't feel that I have a ton of reasons to be depressed. My family is financially stable, I attend a top-10 university (freshman) and am not having huge trouble with school. I have friends.

Unfortunately, sometimes I find myself being a total dick to my friends when I'm in a bad mood (again, often the source of the bad mood is either miniscule or nonexistant). An example of something that pissed me off happened less than 20 minutes ago. I was talking on the phone with my mother, and she used the expression ""when push comes to shove,"" which is one of her go-to expressions. This might sound stupid but my parents' mannerisms are very predictable and bother me a whole lot. I was tempted to let out a noise and throw the phone against the wall entirely because she said that one phrase. Yeah.

I definitely have some family issues. I'm an only child, and I've noticed that at college, while other people talk about their families a lot, I rarely do. About a week ago, one of my close friends asked me to talk about my family. I did, and started feeling queasy and pissed off as I did so. Eventually another one of my friends cut in with something about her own family and I blew up, saying that she shouldn't have interrupted me. Sometimes I have a horrible temper, other times I can be incredibly patient. I am *never* in a good mood when I speak to my parents, and if they call, when I answer the phone it gets rid of my good mood, if I was in one. My dad yelled a LOT, and would get angry at me for stuff I never thought was a big deal. One memory that just now popped into my head was during a piano recital years and years ago-- I must have been 8? I had to play *La Cucaracha*. I messed up playing, and was really embarrassed. I tried again and messed up. Extremely embarrassed, I just went back to my seat without finishing the song. It was ok at the recital, but once we got away from other people, my dad freaked out on me. This is how it usually goes. He's nice when any other people are around, but freaks out when it's just me or my mom and I. Then he tries to apologize by saying he didn't mean it. But the damage is always already done. Another memory is during Christmas eve, when the fireplace flue clogged and the room filled with smoke. My dad yelled to the point that I ran to my room and locked the door, stayed there crying while hearing him yelling downstairs. I can never go anywhere on a trip with my dad, because he finds the smallest things to get pissed off at. Like we're running a little late for something unimportant. Or the guy in front of us in the car lane isn't moving quickly enough. And I'm afraid that I'm turning into this, which I hate.

I don't smoke weed regularly now, but I would smoke a couple times a week since about a year ago. Everything seemed fine, although one time a couple months ago I had a panic attack from it. My mind moved incredibly fast and I freaked out, having no one to talk me out of it. I took a break from smoking, then did it twice more with normal results. The third time since the first panic attack I had another, worse panic attack. It was a total freakout. Three or maybe three hundred literal *eternities* passed in 12 minutes. I started thinking bad stuff, came to the conclusion that the universe was a cosmic joke, and while I saw the irony, I still hated it. I feel like there's some real anxiety problems associated with/caused by these experiences. 

Also, I stopped going out to parties, etc. I had a girlfriend for a while, we broke up, and I was fine, but then somehow I just stopped going out. Haven't seen any play lately. Another thing I hate myself for getting pissed off at is one of my good friends. She has a long-distance boyfriend who she has basically invested her entire life into. She talks to him every night online. I was fine having to hear about it before, albeit thinking it silly, but I started getting attracted to her after maybe 4 months of knowing her. And now it pisses me off to no end when she talks about him, considering he just isn't around. I know this is stupid and petty, something I need to get over, but right now it just isn't happening. And it sends me into a bad mood.

I'm going to see a counselor tomorrow. Sorry for the long read, and I welcome any and all comments.",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bzopk/hey_reddit_whats_going_on_with_me/,1272941209
c00ti,depression,dewhashish,"I feel like I'm just a waste of air, even if others dont think that","Back story: I've been diagnosed with depression twice before, and medicated once (zoloft). I stopped taking them myself cause I broke out in hives and hated the fake ""happiness"" it was giving me. I also stopped going to the therapist i was seeing both times: the first time i was around 7, but couldnt afford it. the second time, around 13, i said no and refused to go. I'm 23 now so its been a while since then

lately i've been feeling worthless, people would be better off not knowing me. i fake a good attitude sometimes so most dont notice a thing. 

1. school sucks, and im probably going to fail out of college AGAIN. i was excited to get back and try to finish off my degree, but at some point i hit a low so bad that i just dont even care. i still try but i dont see a point any more.

2. no love life whatsoever, and i dont even care, at least before i wouldve tried.

3. my job is annoying at times, but its better than nothing. i'd like to just find a full time IT job, away from people fixing computers or something, but i dont know where to find a job like that

but just so you know my parents are divorced, and i live with my mom. i do have a big family (at least 50 cousins total, 14 aunts and uncles), and we're all close. i feel like i let them all down, cause they expect a lot. i am fairly smart, and always helping out when i can. a lot of my younger cousins look up to me

sometimes i think i should go back to therapy, get my life in order and try school again, other times i should say fuck it and just work, since ill be doing that for life anyway

c02nx,depression,ArmageddonAardvark,An undelivered letter to my wife.,"A simple, 6 minute phone call today finally pushed me over the edge; it may be the best thing that has ever happened to me. For the first time, I am finally able to articulate all the problems I've been dealing with for the last several months. I've spent the last 4 hours crying, and writing a letter to my wife outlining everything. Below is what came out.

*****

**tl;dr - I don't feel my wife respects me, which has made me angry/resentful/jealous of her success.**

*Why am I always so angry? so tired? so depressed?*

I feel trapped. Every day I go to a job I hate. Every afternoon I pick up our son. Every evening I sit on the couch, alone, waiting for you to come home. **I feel like a live-in housekeeper/nanny with a part-time day job; I feel that's how you see me too.**

You love me, of that I have no doubt. You appreciate the things I do. But I don't think you **respect** me. How can you? I don't even respect myself. I'm not successful like you. I don't have an important job like you. I don't have friends like you. I don't have a life of my own, I play a supporting role in yours.

I'm entirely dependent on you. If you were to leave me, I'd have nothing. I'm all debt and no future. I'd be another 30-something, living at home in my parent's basement because I couldn't make it on my own, again.

*So why all the anger?*

I'm not mad at you, I'm jealous. Every night when you get home late, it's a reminder that I have a worthless job. Every text messages you get is a reminder that I have no friends left. Why do I get mad when you spend all day and night texting people from work? Because it feels like you're trying to escape, that you feel trapped too. When you finally get home, then spend half the night talking with other people, it feels like you'd rather spend time with them. You **respect** them. They have important jobs. **They live the life you want, the life you know you'll never have with me..** I don't care that you talk to friends, or that you stop by the bar to hang out for a few minutes on the way home. I'm not mad at you, I'm dissatisfied with my own life, and seeing that you'd rather be with them only adds to my depression.

*""What about you?"", you'll ask. You go to the bars with friends I've never met, and always seem more excited, more talkative, happier, when other people come to house.*

That is all true. But do you know why? **It's because those people see me the way I see you.** They think **I'm** successful. They are jealous of **my** life. They respect **me**. For those few hours, every couple of months, I respect myself.

*Why haven't you told me about this?*

* I didn't know. I had a vague idea of what's been eating at me for months, but couldn't quite identify what specifically was wrong.

* I don't know how. I've started to tell you a dozen times. But because I didn't know that the problem lay with me, I blamed you. I resented you for having the life I wanted, and instead of talking about it, I attacked it.

* I don't know why. You can't fix this. I don't know if I can fix this. You once told me about a conversation you had regarding your attitude toward a coworker. You don't respect him. Your manager said she didn't want you to feel that way. You said you'd work with him, that you would get along with him, but that you couldn't change how you felt about him just because she wanted you to. That's how I feel. I could tell you, but no matter how much you want it, I can't change how I think you feel about me.

* Because I'm afraid. If I tell you how I feel, the idea is now in your head. You'll deny it of course. You'll tell me all the reasons why you love me. You'll list all the things I've accomplished. But that idea will be in your head. You'll fight it. You'll try to come home earlier for a week or two. You'll say you'll stop talking/texting people when you're at home. But it won't last. Even if it did, it won't matter. **I can't get happiness by taking your's away.** You'll try to find me a new job. You'll look at websites, and ask for my resume to send to a friend of a friend. But nothing will come of it, and that idea will still be in your head. One day you'll wake up and realize that I'm right. You'll realize that you'll never be have the life you want with me. You'll realize that there are guys, guys whom you respect, who are just waiting for an opportunity to be with you. You'll finally decide that you have to do what's right for you, and that means leaving the guy who's holding you back, leaving me. I'll understand because I know I'm the one holding you back from all the things you want in life. I can't be mad, because I'm the one who put that idea in your head in the first place.

*Will a new job make you happy?*

I've worked jobs I hated before, so why the urgency now? Why the desperation to find something new? While it's true I hate my job, this time is different. This time I'm not trying to run away from something I don't like, but toward something else. I feel that a new job, a **better** job, will make all the other problems disappear. If I only made more money, if I only had a more impressive title, if I only worked in a position **you respected**, then I would have no reason to be resentful/jealous of you.

But the truth is, that is never going to happen. Any position I'm offered would mean giving up all the things we love about my job; the schedule, the paid time off, the benefits. To make up for that, I'd have to get more money than I'm worth. I've spent too long in a job too far from my desired field. I simply don't have the skills or experience to do anything else.

I don't even think I have it in me to keep trying. It's not the rejection that hurts. It's that with each new application, I convince myself that this is the one. I **believe** that I've finally found the job of which we can both be proud. Each time, I build my expectations higher than the last, and each rejection means I'm falling further, falling harder than the previous. I'm tired, I'm broken, and I'm beaten. I don't think I can go through it again.

*So what do we do now?*

I don't know. I need to finally accept that this is my life. Once I do that, maybe I can re-define what a successful life, what fulfilling life, means to me. Maybe then I'll be able to appreciate my life for what it is. Perhaps happiness isn't getting what you want, it's wanting what you have. I don't know that I'll ever stop being jealous of you. I don't know that I'll ever shake this feeling that you don't respect me. As you said, you can't change how you feel, no matter how much someone wants you to feel differently.

**BUT I'M TRYING**

*****

If anyone made it to this point, thank you. I want to be clear though, I'm not looking for sympathy, for solidarity, or for suggestions. I *will* talk to my wife sooner rather than later. I'm just just home alone today, and really needed an outlet to get this off my chest. So really, thank you.

c0718,depression,Auyan,Not sure what to think anymore.,"In Novermeber 2009 I finally got myself to go to the psychiatrist after at least 8 years of dealing with PTSD and major depression on my own.  Immediately after beginning medicines, I lost my job.  I was (fortunate?) enough to have lost it when I did, as I was able to keep my health insurance for only 35% of the premium.  I decided to go back to school and was doing, well, better than I can remember.  I thought I would be able to get medical coverage through my college, but being that I'm a graduate student I can not.  I am too old to be covered by my parent's insurance.  I can also not use the school services (ie therapy) as my ""tuition costs don't cover it as do the undergraduate tuitions"".  I called around, and since I live in a rather obscure area, there were only two sliding scale places available to me.  I called them each, and both said they were not taking new patients at this time, and to keep calling back weekly.  Fastforward to March where I lost my COBRA coverage because I could no longer afford it, let alone any individual coverage plans.  My psychiatrist knew ahead of time.  Fastforward to April where all my prescriptions ran out.  The pharmacy gave me a three-day ""emergency"" supply of Sertraline while they continued to fax the psychiatrist.  The sliding scale places still don't have any openings, my (old) psychiatrist won't prescribe me any more refills without bloodwork and a check-up (and ethically I wouldn't want him to), and I don't have a primary care physician so I can't get them prescribed that way.

Not sure what to think of these, as the only experience I have with medicine dosages were in dealing with institutionalized clientelle, but I was taking Sertraline 150mg QD, Propranolol 10mg BID, Lorazepam 0.5mg PRN-TID.

Since I was unable to acquire new prescriptions, I had to stop them all ""cold-turkey"".  The side effects I've been experiencing the past few weeks have made me consider suicide, self-injury, ""disappearing"", etc.  I've had extremely bizarre mood swings, random crying fits, and an instability in irritability (my poor S.O.).  Even worse have been the physical symptoms; the ""brain shivers"", the ""zaps"", the tingling and numbness, the nausea, the chest, back and neck pains...

Point of writing: I'm not sure what to think anymore.  Was it worth it?  Should I have bothered starting?  Is there an option (besides moving to Canada) that I've missed?  What can I do?  If I begin a medical regimen again, will the side effects desist?  How long will these last?
At present, I regret having started medications in that I consider myself worse-off now than before I began.  ""If I knew then what I know now...""

**tl;dr: Forced to stop meds cold-turkey and now am conflicted.**",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c0718/not_sure_what_to_think_anymore/,1273032446
c0gzy,depression,strange_terrain,I'm in a really dark place and I don't know if I need help,"I don't know how many posts make it onto /r/depression about relationships, but if they are many then I ask that you please tolerate yet another...

I spent just over a year with an absolutely fantastic girl. We were both madly in love with each other, and there wasn't a single thing I would change about her. She was perfect for me. I was perfect for her. Things were great... until our spring break. She went on a trip with some of her friends, I went on a trip with some of mine. When she came back, she seemed way less into the relationship than she had before, citing several circumstantial issues which we were both responsible for but which were *actually getting better*. A week later she cut and run out of the blue, without giving our relationship a chance. 

I have experienced breakups before, but this has been particularly bad. I can't get her out of my head. She's in my dreams 4/5 nights, and every morning I wake up feeling her warmth next to me, only to open my eyes to the reality that she isn't there. It is so hard to get out of bed. This has been increasingly crippling for me, to the point where I have barely left my room if it wasn't for the finals I have to take. I've lost a lot of interest in a lot of things that I used to like to do, and I feel less motivated than I have in a long time.

I finally broke down in the shower two days ago. I'm completely losing it. What she did ***doesn't make ANY sense*** (she admitted this a few weeks after) and I feel like I'm slowly regressing to a world where only she exists and nothing else is worth caring about. The world is making less and less sense and I can't cope with it. I don't know if I'm losing touch with reality or not, and I don't have any concrete reason to think I am except that it just *feels* like it. I don't sleep much any more. I thought after a month and a half I would have at least begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but right now I'm not convinced it's ever going to get better. What's more, I'm terrified that I'll never get over her, and that anyone else I find I'll always feel like I'm settling. I've never missed someone so much in my life...

Suicide has been on my mind more recently, too. **I have absolutely no intention of doing it**; I have too much else going for me and I know it... I wasn't raised as a quitter. But I never used to think about it this much, and it seems to be pervading my thoughts more and more each day. It's almost as if I don't want to die, but I wouldn't care if it happened. Things just seem so dark without her... :(

/r/depression, I don't know what's going on with me. I know it's normal to be depressed after parting with a loved one, but I've never experienced it like this before and I've received at least one suggestion to get help. I don't know if I need it. I'm also terrified that it's just a fast-track to anti-depressants, and I really really *really* don't want to take any kind of medicine that fucks with my state of mind. 

What's going on with me? Am I depressed? Am I going crazy?

Thanks for reading my incoherent wall of text.

c0hbi,depression,[deleted],Kinda lost...,"I'm 28, male, and have had depression on and off since I was about 16. I have lost years of my life to it.

One of the most damning things about depression is, along with the downs, you get this wicked sense of perspective that haunts you, regardless of your current emotional state. It is perspective that is prompting this post. I'm not entirely certain I want the Western ideal of life. It seems so cushy and empty. I don't want my life to be about those things. Right now, I'm a software developer. I make good money (the profession is overpaid). And I'm good at my job. But the pay, and the job bother me. I feel entirely selfish hoarding this money. However, if I did that, then I wouldn't be able to put a down payment on a house -- whenever that happens. Job-wise, I've been mentally checked out for years at it, and I continue to slide further away. I like the work, but it generates so much stress, and I'm always told it is 'normal' in the industry -- personally, I think that is people's stockholm syndrome talking. Really, I don't want to switch jobs and eventually hit this same problem a few years from now. Socially, I have some good friends, and tend not to date that much. I see dating as fixated on evolutionary displays of sexual fitness, all of which are extremely selfish. It's not that I'm a perfect altruist (I'm not), but I at least can see bullshit for what it is, and the shallowness that pervades the 'culture' of dating is self-indulgent BS. The perfect woman would be the one who is sweet and would ditch their nice job on a whim if it meant doing service work overseas somewhere not-so-nice.

In short: I feel empty inside. I know our society runs on money, but I feel complicit in how it cultivates violence (of sorts) against those that are not as lucky as I am. I am part of the problem. And I want to change that. Am I just a dumb idealist? Has someone been here before?

It's not that I'm a perfect altruist (I'm not), but I at least can see bullshit for what it is, and the shallowness that pervades the 'culture' of dating is self-indulgent BS. The perfect woman would be the one who is sweet and would ditch their nice job on a whim if it meant doing service work overseas somewhere not-so-nice.

In short: I feel empty inside. I know our society runs on money, but I feel complicit in how it cultivates violence (of sorts) against those that are not as lucky as I am. I am part of the problem. And I want to change that. Am I just a dumb idealist? Has someone been here before?

c0p8v,depression,[deleted],I just need to get this off my chest.,"**TL;DR - I was fucked up when I was a kid, avoided getting help and now feel that was a mistake.**

I've been debating making this post for a long time.  I really need to get this off my chest so today is the day.

For the first part of my childhood I was a very well adjusted child.  Then one day I lost some one very important to me (and watched it happen) and I kinda snapped.  I started hurting myself (tried to kill myself a couple times) and others.  After a couple years of this I realized it was not in my best interests to continue down the serial killer path and to avoid being institutionalized by my parents I faked 'normal'.

I didn't know how to interact with people anymore so I was very quite and just observed.  I was a awkward around everyone, but as long as I wasn't acting bat shit crazy my parents thought everything was fine.  Eventually I got the hang of it and even though those years weren't the best years, I feel like I've more or less become the person that well adjusted little kid was meant to be.

The lie may have become the truth, but I know that angry, violent little kid is still in there and he hates me and I hate him.  Some days I feel like the internal struggle I have is coming to a head and it's gotten more frequent and maddening.  I think I got to use to being me and became complacent.  


I don't know.  Maybe I'm not as in control as I thought I was.  I think I want and need the professional help I should have gotten when I was a kid.

P.S. I recently started hurting myself again.

c1bbl,depression,BrewRI,I've been struggling for the past 18 months or so,"I don't know why I've felt so bad for the past year or two. I've tried to take a step back and attempt to look at it from another person's point of view and it's made me feel worse in a sort of way. I'm 22 and in college right now, I have plenty of people I can spend time with on the weekends or weekday night if I feel like going out. I'm managing a business for the first time and am receiving more income from work than any other point in my life. I have no problem finding women I can be close to. I've still felt empty for lack of a better term. Over the past year and a half things have been beginning to fall apart. My grades have been dropping, I believe I'm close to losing my job. The worst part is that I feel depressed about feeling depressed. In a sense I have nothing to complain about. I grew up in an upper-class family, I've had my share of losses/hard time but nothing more than your average person. But I still have a lingering feeling of being alone. I feel like every time I'm around people I put on an act in order to shelter the way I've really been feeling. The past 6 months I've done a lot of reflecting on my life and my values. I need to be up early for work so I spend a lot of nights alone thinking about my life and I just can't figure out what is bothering me so much. I apologize if I can't put my thoughts in an articulate manner, I've never tried to express what I've been thinking to another party so I understand if a lot of this doesn't make sense. It's like everyday I'm going through the motions just because I know what motions to go through, not because I actually care about anything I do. It has dawned on me that the real reason I took my job is b/c I've been worried about being kicked out of my home and having to support myself (I'm diabetic which is a very large expense). I've been turning to alcohol more and more over the past few weeks, I drink every night so I can go to sleep without arguing with myself at night. I know I don't have any specific thing I can put my finger on that makes me feel the way I do and if it makes any sense it makes me feel bad about myself for feeling bad in the first place. Over the past month I've had a growing feeling that everything is going to unravel, I won't be able to keep up with my ""act"" before things come crashing down and I just don't know what to do. I understand if this doesn't make a lot of sense, I'm not editing it or going over it, I just feel like I need to express it in some way. I've been trying to keep everything to myself and I've noticed I've been getting very angry very quickly over things that should seem trivial and I don't want to hurt anyone physically or emotionally so I'm hoping just writing this down will help",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c1bbl/ive_been_struggling_for_the_past_18_months_or_so/,1273287061

Completely forgot I had my Dad as a friend, and he confronted me about it and wouldn't leave me alone until I gave him an actual reason to the status. I told him I had it and asked him to leave, which he did. Huge mistake on my part.

For unrelated reasons, I had to switch psychiatrists, and have been on citalopram, buspirone, and lorazepam (sparingly) for the last few years. Lately I've been having some severely depressive episodes and my psychiatrist upped my citalopram dosage by 50%. I really hope it works. I would like some relief.

I'll be fine for a month or two and then turn into a complete wreck for two or three more. I wish I could stop it. It's slowly tearing me apart and I can never rebuild.

My name is Ian. I am twenty years old. I have only recently come to terms with the fact that I suffer from depression. Before I would simply tell myself to quit being a baby and deal with my problems like everyone else. I would put on a fake face every time I went outside. Everybody gets down, but they get over it and move on with their lives. I completely shut down for months at a time. I spend my days crying and laying in the middle of my floor listening to the same song on repeat. I sit on the couch chainsmoking and staring at the blank television screen.

I stayed up all night last night. This is how it always starts. My mom came in before she left for work and asked if I was ok. ""I'm fine"" was my reply. She told me she loved me and shut the door. I cried for five minutes. I don't know why.

During these periods, contemplation of suicide is a daily occurrence. I've thought about a hundred different ways to do it, but never tried. The closest I ever got was staring at a handful of Simply Sleep and then breaking down crying. Thinking about suicide is very often how I manage to get to sleep.

I want this to stop. I hate feeling like this. I've been on antidepressants in the past, but they either didn't work or completely altered my emotions to the point where I could no longer feel pleasure or sadness. I've considered therapy but I have no health insurance as I'm a recent college dropout and am currently unemployed.

c2ucp,depression,Estehbahn,Graduation Freak Out - Am I Just in a Depressed State of Mind?,"Hey gang,

Im graduating from university soon with a Bachelors in Biology. I'm not excited by the careers that I've heard of in medicine and science and I don't have much of a resume to help me get into a grad school. I have a big interest in improv comedy and I want to some day write and act in sketch comedy shows, internet shows, and hopefully TV shows. I have this dream of taking lots of classes in acting, improv, and speaking. Currently I'm a leader in an improv club at my school and I make a comedy show on my college radio station.

I want to build up a lot of experience and skills in this area by taking improv classes, reading books, making material for the internet. I'm really hoping that my parents could help me during this time. The thing is, my dad only supports me to certain ends. He is upset that I'm not going into healthcare or education (like I have told him before I wanted to do). A lot of talking with my dad ends up in me shutting down and giving in or him doing some browbeating.

I do not have the resources to go out on my own and for my entire life, I have been depending on my parents for a lot of things: tuition, living expenses, medical coverage. I did have a 9-month stint where I was paying my own way in a new city, but I eventually went back to school instead of pushing on. I was exhausted and a little lonely and dissappointed with myself.

Another factor is that I have a history of depression and I'm going to be talking with some counselors to see if I should get on anti-depressants. I've been on anti-depressants twice before (celexa 10mg and then celexa 20mg). It's entirely possible that I could start some anti-depressants and then forget all about trying to get an entertainment career. I could get interested in a more secure career and then be content to do amateur stuff on the side. This whole dilemma could blow right on by if I get a new prescription and change my state of mind.

I'm having a tough time with this situation and I'm getting a lot of anxiety and not enjoying myself. My plan so far is to find some kind of transitional job where I can save enough money to pay for more of the training I want, or a car.

I'd like to hear about how people have co-operated with their parents in the past or some feedback on how people have gotten by without their parents helping them. I'd like other questions in general too. I'm pretty freaked out right now and I'm having a lot of catastrophic thinking. I'm also having more social anxiety than normal. I'll be talking to a counselor about all of this later and I'll give updates if there's interest.

More background on my state of mind: I've been active in group therapy and prior to that I've seen a therapist for about a year. I took myself off of my meds once before and the next time I was on I took them regularly for two years before going off of them this last time in March 2010. My dad is clinically bi-polar and he doesn't have a career. After his diagnosis nearly 20 years ago he started taking some kind of social security stipend (to pay for raising a family I guess) and then he started following his own dream of being a writer.

c3fsd,depression,rhinestoneeyes,I'm going to end up stabbing myself and it's not what I really want.,"I'm sure you guys are used to this, but I'm using a throwaway account.  I don't like looking at my old posts where I sound hopeful only to come back and say I feel the exact opposite the next day/week.  Don't worry, background information really isn't that important in this case beyond the basics I'm giving you.

 * Live with my parents
 * No job
 * No schooling
 * No plans
 * On SSRIs (not working)
 
Beyond that I really just don't care what happens to me.  I go through feelings of wanting to take a bat to everything I own, to apathy/happy if that makes any sense, to not being able to get out of bed all day and finally to the rare moments of happiness.  And this process just repeats and I'm more than sick of it.  The only thing I'm any good at is putting up this front of being happy/confident.  

I'm making this post now, because it's come to the point that my folks are just sick of my apathetic attitude towards my future and I've been told more or less that they aren't accepting my jokes anymore and that I either need to get a job or go to school.  

For the last week I've just been acting like I'm putting in applications to keep them from exploding on me.  I can really feel how angry/upset/disappointed they are in me.  My jokes just aren't as funny 3 years later... I'm surprised it's taken this long.  I plan on leaving on my own before they have the chance to kick me out.  I don't want to add any more survivor's guilt.

So, the answer is simple right?  Go to school.  Actually put in applications.  Done.  The problem is that I just do not care about anything.  The only thing I spend any amount of time thinking about is suicide. 

I know where this is going to end up.  Every time I go out I always go to the same park and contemplate committing suicide.  I used to look for a painless, easy way to get out, but I'm over that at this point.  I'm going to end up stabbing myself in the heart sitting in a shitty park in a shitty town full of shitty people and it's not what I really want.

I just want to feel motivated to do something besides kill myself.  It's all I think about when I don't have music on.  Is there a pill I can take for motivation? haha  What's your advice?  And remember you're dealing with a person that's highly unmotivated most of the time, but when I'm feeling that apathetic happiness I can try (and have tried) many different things.

I was just prescribed Wellbutrin a couple weeks ago, a lower dosage, since the side effects and comedown of Celexa were a nightmare and I was afraid of the same results.

I know I need to talk to a professional because I cannot control this, this controls me. I know this rationally and yet irrationally? I can't even pick up the phone and make an appointment with a GP for a referral to a psychiatrist/psychologist because that would mean admitting for real that there might be something wrong. I wish he would make the appointment for me but I think he thinks that doing this myself would be empowering - which I suppose it would be but actually the thought of speaking to someone terrifies me. 

First of all, I don't even know what to say. I'm not suicidal. I'm not even sad. It's like caffeine withdrawal and you get fuzzy in the head. But it's more than that. I feel like I've been fuzzy for years. I can't concentrate. My memory is terrible. I hide behind a computer screen to take my mind of ""the here and now"". I avoid social contact, even something like facebook just feels traumatizing (although that might just be because facebook IS a terrible, terrible place). I used to feel angry but now I don't even feel that. In my early twenties I could talk myself out of ""a funk"" but not anymore. 

As you may be able to tell, I can't even put it in words on the Internet so what am I going to say if the GP asks, ""Why do you want to see a psychiatrist for?"" Where do I begin? I don't even have a GP because I rarely have the need. How do I know if a psychiatrist is good or bad?

I am called a pessimist a lot, but I am really just a realist.  I grow tired of bleak optimism from others. 

Every day I read this and see that, X country is becoming a police state, and 4,000 people just lost their lives in a religious war like yesterday. Y is being censored and Z is at the full mercy of a broken legal system. All of it passes my eyes as news that basically says ""TL;DR - Your world is fucked, why are you still in it"".

Everyone tells me I'm so opinionated so why don't I do something to change what I don't like about the world?  I feel no motivation to do so. I give up. I've never really taken initiative because it's in me to just whine about things whenever I feel I can get away with it. I hate it all, the ignorance and injustice and killing. I just can't get myself to put up with it or take up a cause against it. I just want to get away.

I feel like I say my piece and then retire the stage before a crowd can assess what they just heard, a soapbox announcement in a busy street because no one's going to do what they hear unless they come from the same position.

The nature I try to paint is being burned for farmland and pavement.  The animals I read about are being made extinct by the people I see in malls. I do it too. 
I'm sorry for being part of the human race, a race in which no one wins without killing for first place.

I'm not suicidal. If it is an option, it's a very distant one.  I don't see why it should be ruled out, ever. Death should be by my hand above anything else, especially when I become a burden on myself. One of the main reasons I won't consider it is because there are others around me, friends family and relatives that would all sit there grieving or wondering why I did it. Suicide's never painless, and I hate inflicting pain on others.

On top of that my employer has been holding the Axe of Damocles over our heads since January, hinting that our jobs might either;

* Be moved to a different department, moving us along with it, this department would have 100 times more work to do in on top of the ridiculous amount of work we already do. 

* Be off shored.

* Remain here but with no possibility of hiring new people to replace the ones that have left or that have moved to other departments within the next 2-3 years. We are currently down to 14 people including myself, doing the work of what was previously 40. They have not hired anyone new in the past 2 years.

They refuse to fix broken processes, ignore our complaints about other departments directly creating more work for us due to sheer incompetence fueled by greed (promise the client anything they want, give them the least amount of info you can, take as many shortcuts as you can in your work, and move on to the next sucker, Tech support will fix whatever we didn't do right and get a huge commission for signing up so many people.)

Every day I come in to 40-80 calls waiting, shortest wait time is 20-30 minutes longest one I've seen is 3 hours.

Management used to panic when we had 10 minutes wait time.

Everyone in my department is stressed out, angry and frustrated that it's taken 4 months for them just to decide that the first of the 3 options was not going to happen. 

Before this mess started I had my first real vacation planned in September,  even purchased my plane ticket, my non refundable plane ticket. A month long booze and sex filled visit of Thailand. Pathetic I know, but I'm 30, single, fat due to depression and haven't had sex in a long long time.

Now with this job being about as stable as a 3 legged table this plan might dissapear.

I want to quit, but I've lost all direction, I have no dreams, I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore and the only employers that seem to be interested are ones where I would do the same job for less pay. There is also the chance that if I stick it out I will get a fairly large severance. Although at the rate things are going they might figure out a way to screw us out of that.

I can barely sleep, I go to bed at 5-6am every day and wake up every 2 hours until my alarm rings most of the time it takes me an hour to fall asleep each time if I fall asleep at all.

I spend half my weekend in bed, trying unsuccessfully to catch up on lost sleep.

There's a part of me that wants to hurt every single person that annoys me; 

* 2 people standing side by side in an escalator; kick them down the escalator and walk over them.

* loud person on the bus or train; duct tape their mouth and nose shut securely and watch them suffocate.

And those are the nice ones, the other things that pop into my head are much much more gruesome.

Another part knows these thoughts are wrong and just wants me to end it all before they turn into reality.

I feel like I am about to snap an whatever happens next is not going to be pretty.

I went to my doctors to try and get a leave of absence from work for a while, maybe clear my head a bit and look for new jobs without the constant noise in my head.

While I didn't mention the murderous and suicidal thoughts I was fairly clear on the stress, the anxiety, the anger and frustration the lack of sleep.

All he seemed to have heard was lack of sleep and prescribed 4 weeks of sleeping pills, said they wouldn't leave me drowsy during the day but would give me a full nights rest, warned they had a slight metallic taste. I decided to try and trust him, maybe a few good nights sleep would help. 

I threw them in the garbage after 3 days, not only did they not give me a full nights rest, they left me drowsy and confused most of the day and the ""slight"" metallic taste was actually you won't be able to taste anything you eat or drink all day. Not to mention the side effects included high chance of addiction if taken for more than a week.

Took me a week before I could taste things properly again.

I'm at a loss, it seems like any way I look at all this I will wind up suffering in one way or another.

c6vev,depression,qasdfw2er,How to Deal with Mood Swings?,"I've been feeling shitty for the past few months. I became so nonfunctional that I went on Prozac but I hated the side effects and went off of it after a few weeks. I felt good for about a week after I went off of it, pretty much back to normal. However, after that week I began feeling shitty again. I've found that exercise has a tremendous effect on the way I feel. Without it I feel very depressed bordering on suicidal. 

Most days I feel good in the morning but by the afternoon I feel awful. (Lack of interest for everything, not at all social, lots of suicidal/reckless thoughts) Vigorous exercise will pull me out of this but it isn't always possible to do.  

I've also found that lately I've been a lot more reckless and thrill seeking than I normally am. I seem to crave the feeling of  adrenaline.

c6xj6,depression,awaythrow534,Another Friday alone making me realize how depressed I am.,"Alone at home on another Friday night and I think I'm depressed.  However this isn't a ""my life is a train wreck"" situation.  I had hard working parents growing up and they care about me, although we are not close and don't talk often.  I have a brother who calls me once in a while, but there's a huge 12 year age gap between us so we're not close either.  I think most people would consider my job a good one, it's very secure and pays well although personally I hate it (it's all about reviewing technical documents and I have no motivation for it).

None of that is so bad really, but not having anyone to talk to is making me miserable.  Organizing my thoughts and writing them down has made me realize I've only had one good friend my whole life.  We were friends during middle and high school, but my parents moved across the country after I graduated and I followed them to a college in the same state for tuition purposes, and I haven't seen him since.  I was part of a group of friends in high school too, but as soon as I graduated I never heard from any of them again, even over the summer I was still in town so they weren't that close.

Something similar happened in college, where I had a group of friends that did everything together.  We all had similar majors, worked together a lot, and sometimes roomed together over the four years.  A year ago I graduated and moved away while the rest of them stayed to finish up their degrees or go on to graduate school.  Since then, out of a group of around 8 people, two have taken initiative and contacted me.  One of them was asking about helping him get a job.  Otherwise I have to call them, and that has really fucked with my head.  On top of that, every one of those guys was able to get a girlfriend at one point or another, and three of the guys who I'm closest with have one right now.  On the other hand I've never had a girlfriend, have only kissed 2 girls, and am still a virgin at 22.  It really makes me wonder what's wrong with me.

In my new city I haven't made any friends.  I have a few acquaintances that I go drinking with once in a while but I don't like getting as wasted as they do so usually I just stand in the bar, bored.  I have a few hobbies and work out but that's not helping me meet anyone.  The town I live in is too small for me to find people on websites like meetup or okcupid so those don't work.  I've had no one to talk to for the past 8 months and I'm not even sure I know how to make a friend that actually wants to talk to me.

I usually end up thinking about suicide a lot but don't want to do it, which is why this isn't over in /r/suicidewatch.  I want friends to talk to, I want a girlfriend, I want to feel happy, but then another week passes and I haven't met any new friends, another month passes and I haven't heard from any of my old friends, and soon I'll have been here a year looking back at four Fridays out and 48 home alone.  Soon after that I'll be a 23 year old virgin who's never had a girlfriend.  The problem must be with me, but I have no idea what to do.",7,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c6xj6/another_friday_alone_making_me_realize_how/,1274506425

i am wondering if it is possible to start caring about things after not caring about them for so long.  can one really have regard for one's own safety, health, and wellness after having no regard for any of those things whatsoever?  i'm not sure...  if i start to care about any of those things at all, i start freaking out because then i have to try to come to terms with destroying my own life.  it's too much.  
i could go out tonight -- seems pointless tho.  and why display my instability?  srsly getting old.  i have been in bed a lot recently.  sleep is the only escape.  but even then, i have to get up to occasionally drink water or use the bathroom.
eating is a lost cause.
in some way i would like to be able to say 'that was my last overdose' or 'this is my last overdose' and be gone going in circles.  but how could i give up something so endlessly comforting??  and is there a reason i have a million pills?  i guess i have so much since i went off meds again, and get refills for my own sick entertainment.  on the other hand, i find it hard to believe i'm *not* supposed to kill myself with this ""medicine"". so, ok, i think i can elimiate wellbutrin and perphenazine as things i overdose on, but i've mostly done ODs on tylenol/aspirin/etc and i don't think i'll be able to rule them out.
i'm cold. i'm alone.  it's another night i get to spend cold and alone.  it's no exaggeration to say: most nights, i cry myself to sleep.  it's unlikely tonight will be any different.  when i thought i was going to die and was well off in wellbutrin land, i wasn't upset that death was imminent (although i later claimed this as ways of reducing my punishment), i was only upset that i didn't achieve the closure i wanted.

c7p6s,depression,Ogrila,One hell of a ride,"A hour or so ago I got told that my sister just gave birth a healthy beautiful baby girl. Happy news you would think right? I thought it would be but instead it felt like the floor under my feet crumbled away.

I've reached a point in life were I am forced to look back over the past 23 years and I cant stop myself from crying.
Now I was born in 1986 but my earliest memories are from when I was 6.

I was a shy little girl, playing in my big brothers room. I was wearing my favourite white dress. What my big brother did to me was something he would do until I was 14, but after that first day I never put on that dress again.
My brother is paranoid schizophrenic and he told his dockters he did what he did to me because I possessed by a daemon.
My parents were both hard working people, so hard working that they never noticed a thing.

When I was 7 my parents moved and started there own buisness. At first I thought this would be a good thing cause they would be home a hell of a lot more so that surely meant it would stop now.
Unfortunately Hell was only just beginning.
My father had an affair. I never witnessed him kissing another woman.
My parents would fight in the middle of the night and I would be sitting on my mothers lap trying to comfort her and beg her to stop crying. some nights she would lock my dad outside the house, some nights she would leave the house and not return for hours and some nights she would yell that she was going to kill herself and I was begging her not to do it. That's when I started to hate my father.

When I was 12 I run away from home. Looking back at it I am not sure how I got the courage to do it but I found myself on a police station telling them what my brother did to me.
At first they put me in a run away shelter for teens but my mother convinced them that I was lying and sick so after 2 weeks they put me a room with 4 psychiatrists. 
I was 12, I was alone, I was scared and I was confused. After 6 hours in that room repeating my story over and over again I stopped talking. That's when they transferred me over to a mental hospital for children. They put on the closed ward with the ""suicidal"" teens. Suicide was something I hadn't even considered until then.
After 2 weeks my mother told me I was only allowed to come home if I would tell everyone that I had lied. In return she would make sure that once I got home my brother would have moved out.
I just wanted to go home....so I betrayed myself.

When I came home guess who was there waiting for me? My mother lied.
Not only was I now forced to live with a brother who actually wanted me dead. My parents ignored me and told everyone I was mentally ill. My sister who I was extremely close to and gave me the only good childhood memories I had was now treating me like a stranger.

Now at this point my memories get hazy, between 12 and 16 I know what happened but I cant remember the time lines.
After coming home like that I stopped caring, about everything. Just like the day I stopped talking.
I started cutting myself in my arm, I stopped eating, I started drugs and alcohol and pick up bad boyfriends because I thought they would love me. I was admitted a few times for trying to kill myself and from age 14 to 16 I lived almost non stop in a mental hospital.
I watched friends die to the same things I was doing and still I couldn't stop myself.

When I was 16 the head psychiatrist called me into his office. I had never seen him before but suddenly he wanted to see me.
He sat me down I will never forget what he first words he said to me: You are going to die. There was little no emotions in his face and he said it clean and simple.
""You are going to die, you are so self destructive that one day you will just drop dead....I guess you've showed your parents then uh?"".
I left his office without saying anything and the first thought that popped in my head was: I don't want to die!
I threw away my drugs and my scale and started eating again. It took me a few more months but I eventually also stopped cutting in myself.
6 months later I left the hospital.
I never realised I wasn't cured yet and still all my emotions blocked.

I started a relationship with Laurens. The first year was a dream so happy was I. He loved me and cared for me and he seemed so ""mature"". After that year and I moved in with him he started to change.
He started saying things like how he would cheat on me if I didn't have sex with him that night. And how horrible I was to live with and how lucky I was that he would even conciser putting up with me.
That was also the year that the dockters told me I have Fibromyalgie. A condition that causes me to be in a lot of pain.
2 Years later he destroyed every little piece of self worth I had left.
I was nothing. A empty shell, just sleeping, trying not to feel the pain.
One day we got into a fight and he had pushed me around before but this was different. His eyes were filled with rage. I only just ducked the fist that was coming after me and as soon as I realised what happened something inside me snapped. 
All the anger of all the years of the things that happened in my life seemed to come to this point. 
I raised my head and looked deep into his eyes. I told him I was not afraid of him and he needed to leave, right now!
Just like that day when I was 12 and went to the police, I don't know how I found the courage to do it, but I did. 
He cried, he begged, he got angry, he told me I was nothing without him, then he cried some more and eventually left.",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c7p6s/one_hell_of_a_ride/,1274740474

My current situation just got a bit worse and I've found myself out of a job and with only temporary (1 month) accommodations.

c8chl,depression,nanotoothpaste,"I am intersexed.  When people see me, they laugh and stare.  A few days ago, I couldn't take it anymore...","Let me start with a little background.  I am intersexed.  Was born slightly ""off"" and have a large skeletal structure.  I'm a big person, rather stocky and 6' 2"". Other than this though, I have the shape and facial features of an average female.  Because of this, I've always been leery of public places, afraid to go anywhere people might see me and ridicule me.  Every once in a while, my friends or loved ones drag me out though.  Sunday was one of those days.

My partner and I went to the local mall together and we bought some videogames. Gamestop is blowing out all of their original Xbox games, buy one get two free. So I got a huge stack of crap.  Good times. 

We were leaving the mall, and there was this group of people…Probably late teens to early twenties.  They caught a glimpse of my partner and I and started laughing at us, snickering, pointing...the whole nine yards. I looked over at them and they all became even more rowdy.  Then their ringleader waved at me.  Everyone erupted into laughter. I immediately thought it was me...that they read me, and that they were sort of insulting me specifically.  Day in and day out I deal with it -- people destroying my self-esteem with their eyes and their laughing.  But this time, these people took it too far.  It built to a point where I couldn't feel anything but adrenaline in my veins.

I basically snapped.  Every feeling of inadequacy about my body, and every time I'd ever been wronged by someone.  I swear, it was either down to me physically assaulting them, or confronting them.  I did number two.

I followed them around the parking lot for a good 5 minutes or so.  Every time they turned, I turned.  Slowly, I crept up to their bumper and just tailed them.  They pulled back into the parking lot and I pulled in beside them.  They all had these really big, vicious smiles on their faces, and I became livid.  I smiled back and motioned for them to roll their windows down.

""So, why were you waving at me?"" I said.  These two women in the back seat started laughing and the guy in the driver's seat had a huge smile on his face.  ""Oh, Nothing."" he said.  ""Just being friendly.""

""Oh, that's interesting.  So you must know me.  Since we know each other so well, how about if I follow you?  I'll just...you know, follow you around, maybe follow you home.  Watch where you live.  I have no life...I'm practically a loser.  I have the time, trust me.  Yeah, I think I'll do that.  I'll follow you.""  Then I rolled my window up and parked a few parking spaces away, in their line of site.  I waved at them and smiled with a really big psychotic grin.

At this point, I couldn't tell if they were frustrated I was following them or if they thought it was funny, so against the urgings of my partner, I got out of the car, sat on my hood, and waved at them.  They started pulling out, I ran into my car and got right up behind them again.  I tailed them for a good five minutes, until eventually they pulled into another parking lot across the way and got their cell phones out.  I made sure I had my insurance and was legal in case they were calling the cops, and just sat there for a few minutes.

Then I honked my horn, and laughed VERY loud, like, as loud as I could...in the most psychotic way possible.  At which point, I took off and went to Taco Bell.

As the adrenaline wore off and I came down from the rage-high, I realized just how reckless I was.  And at that moment, I felt all the more ugly, pitiful, and worthless.  I cried for hours, it seemed, until eventually I got home and took a few Xanax with some swigs of Southern Comfort.

I am finding it difficult to even function without thinking about my body or my identity.  Part of me hates the universe for making me this way, but another part hates myself for caring so much.  I am not sure what to do anymore because I feel like my life has no real meaning.  It's as if I only exist to be an object of ridicule for other people.  I don't even understand what my partner sees in me and my damaged body, and days at work seem like charades where people are just nice to me for professionalism's sake; that outside of here, my coworkers would more than likely be the ones pointing and laughing.

I've tried meds and they don't seem to work.  I am not sure if there is an answer.  Does anyone else have any advice for someone who is disfigured and has to go into public?

Also, I am very sorry about the length of this.  I just need to talk to someone...anyone, and this damned text box is all I have.

I've always been socially awkward and had a lot of trouble making friends, which was a big part of why I was depressed. But I did fairly well academically and so I embraced the geek in me and clung to that.

I always thought I'd go to grad school and become a physics professor or the like, but in my last few years of undergrad I became severely depressed and lethargic and ruined whatever chance I had of good rec. letters and grades.

So I've been out on my own for a bit over a year since I graduated and moved far away from the state I grew up in, and I just feel like my life is going nowhere. I haven't made any real close friends, I've lost touch with the few I used to have in college. I've been fired from the 2 shitty jobs I've had since I moved here.

I've been trying to keep busy recently so I won't feel so bored and depressed, but it's really hard to find ways to fill the day without a job and since I have so much trouble meeting people and making good impressions.

I'm 29, I work a 9-5 job that I enjoy, although I wish it paid more, I've got enough money to pay the bills and save some for old age. I live with a roommate who doesn't come out of his bedroom except to work and get food. I'm not completely unattractive, I'm a big guy, 5'8 and 240lbs to be precise. 
I need help Reddit and I've nobody else to turn to. I need help finding a friend, I don't want to bother my family with it, I don't want them knowing I've got these problems. I don't have any friends that would listen so all I have is myself.
Most days after work I just sit at my computer and stare at my facebook page or watch streaming video games. What I want most of all is someone to talk to. Someone who will listen and help me get through. I'm looking for a good friend who I can hang out with on weekends or during the week. 
I'm not much of a social person, I'd rather have a few really good friends then a whole bunch of ""acquaintances"". I've got some buddies I go drinking with but they aren't really the listening type. I've had one girlfriend so far and don't have much hope of finding another. I'm slowly coming to terms with that, I don't like it but so far all my attempts have failed at even getting a woman to talk to me. I've tried 3 online dating sites and after numerous attempts to make contact with women I've had a total of 2 conversations in a year. I haven't even met any of them. 

Sometimes when I get really depressed I seriously consider just ending it all. Drive out to a field somewhere and just shoot myself. 
The only thing stopping me is a promise I made to myself.
""I won't kill myself while my mom still lives"". I don't want her to have to deal with a child dieing. Or her knowing how messed up I am. Sometimes that's the only thing keeping me alive. However, if she was to die tomorrow I'd follow a week later by my own hand.

Maybe this is a last resort. Posting on a throwaway account to a board I don't even know that well, with all my problems hoping some person who reads this would even care enough to reply or even care enough to help.

Beyond this I really don't know what to do. There's nobody in my life that can help me, and if I knew what to do I would have already done it.

c90qh,depression,throwawaysomeday,"Depressed, lost and confused.","Reddit:
A lot has been happening to me recently, and it's bringing me down to a level of depression I haven't felt in since high school (I had cronic fatigue syndrome, put on a lot of weight, acne, everything - as such I didn't have many friends and was depressed for quite a while.)

Since high school I've worked a lot, studied here and there, and am currently enrolled in a BSc (over 1/2 way there, passing ok).  I also hold down 2 part time jobs among other things.  This last week has been hard though.

I spoke to someone I barely knew, and they gave me a better indication of who I am and why I do what I do than I would ever realise on my own.  I keep myself busy to avoid my own issues in life.  Most of my problems stem from loneliness and  complete cluelessness when it comes to developing friendships.  I can get along with people alright, but in my past I've completely switched social circles every 2 years or so (as in broke virtually all contact with them).  

I have no clue what I am going to do in life, other than I don't want a desk job.  This doesn't really fit in with a BSc (I'm studying math btw).  This past week I've had 3 major assignments due, and when you sit in lectures thinking:  'How will this help me in the end?' it starts to get to you.  

I am approaching another birthday and am depressed.  I feel I've missed out somehow, high school and teen years didn't really happen in some strange way.  I got drunk occasionally, did drugs more and more often until I saw the damage I was doing to myself, but I never made a lasting friendship or any real social skills.  If I'm at a party I generally end up being the person in the corner not really doing anything, or in some situations I'll end up finding a 'job' to occupy the time (ie sober driver.  I'm more or less a recluse (some have mentioned it).  Longest friendship I've had is just over 2.5 years and I've never had a girlfriend.  I see people around me with free time who have close friends/partners and in some ways I envy them.

I have a friend who is going overseas for what I really believe will be a life changing experience, getting her on track career wise and being a character building experience.  I am concerned for her as she has met people overseas through forums and will meet them (they are staying in the same hotel for several days and one has proposed to her - having never met her or spoken afaik).  She is someone who I care for greatly and I don't want  getting hurt.  She has had more than her share of abusive relationships in the past and I think it has affected her ability to trust those around her.  It all seems a bit strange to me as well, I can't really see why she is taking such a risk.

tl;dr
Depression approaching a birthday.  No confidence and general self-doubt verging on hatred.  The one person I care about is taking a risk meeting strangers overseas.  Studying without a clue of what I'm going to do afterwards. Advice needed.

I'm lazy to the point of sitting in bed all weekend, haven't had a job since I graduated high school (2.5 years ago), I live at home which is 30min (lengthy in this town) drive away from university at which I'm a mediocre student in an already quite easy CS degree. 

The spare time I have is frivolously wasted browsing the net for a myriad of interests I don't act upon in regular life, half of which get me down. For this, I'm a pseudo-confident shell of a person who's too boring to get to know. Plus as a male at 20, supposedly leading up to the prime of my life, I'm a virgin who has little concept of partying because I'm too busy reading about intl politics and psychoanalysing myself. I like the social interaction I get but I don't reach out and grab for it.

I just spend the whole week crunching uni work since it was left till the end of semester, and the bit due two hours ago didn't turn out as better than a pass. I sulked over to reddit (where I'm a lurker and compulsive daily clicker) and have just spent an hour here. **TL;DR** So it's 2am and I'm drained more so than usual, and I've gone and given you a sob story in which I've scraped the surface of my self-evident failings that I could more thoroughly deconstruct in an essay. I never act upon them even though I constantly think about changing them, and I don't know why I procrastinate further.

Give me a solid written kick in the butt here - I'm not facing the problems of a regular depressives because a handful of them I could quite easily change.

ca42f,depression,throwaway8888i,What are the first steps in getting help?,"I'm pretty much the most socially awkward, socially inept, socially retarded person you'd ever know.

For all of my life (I'm 25 now) I was blissfully ignorant of the world and my place in it.  Only recently (past year or so) have I started becoming painfully aware of how other people perceive me and what they think of me, and generally what kind of person this condition really makes me.  And it's *horrifying*.  It's gotten to the point where I now dread and try to avoid things I used to do fine before (like social functions at work) just because of the embarrassment this new realization has brought.  Obviously not a step in the right direction.

Anyway.  I've come to the conclusion some time ago that I need help for this, but I keep dragging my feet.  I'm very ignorant on what I'd need to do.

I am gainfully employed, and have good insurance.  I looked through their list of preferred providers for ""mental health"".  But what do I choose?  Psychiatry?  Psychology?  Something else completely?  What kind of issues are people with these titles normally trained to treat?

When I do choose, what do I say when I call up/visit?  What should I expect?  I have this fear that I'm going to be spending quite a deal of effort justifying my being there.  I mean, I wouldn't argue that I'm ""clinically"" depressed, or have any mental diseases in the traditional sense.

cawm1,depression,Worthless_Useless,I need advice,"TL;DR: I'm a depressed, spoiled brat who is too dumb to realize how good he has it, and instead is paranoid that everyone wants him to go away.


This is my first thing to ever post to reddit (I've been lurking for a long time), but I am at the end of my rope, and I need an audience to hear me.  Please forgive me if my writing is a little scattered.

I have an awesome family who has supported me emotionally and financially on many occasions (I am living with my parents right now while I am working on my Masters degree).  I am in no financial trouble, I live in a wealthy area of town, I have never gone wanting for anything that I needed.  However, I am incredibly depressed (hence the whole posting to /r/depression).  The fact that I'm not just giddy with how fortunate I am frustrates me, and makes me feel like I'm just a spoiled brat.

However, I think that most of my trouble stems from the fact that I view myself as an abject failure.  I used to say that my one redeeming quality was my intelligence (that is, the only thing that I had that I could be proud of was my intelligence).  However, even that is falling away as it's looking like I'm going to finish my Master's Thesis a year after I had initially planned.  My schoolwork is essentially destroying the one pillar of strength that I used to be able to lean on.

For most of my life, I have been several years behind my age group socially.  Being fat, depression, ADHD, and overall nerdiness have contributed to me being a social outcast for my childhood and teenage years.  At some point, I became so frustrated with this, that I essentially started treating social interactions like a puzzle.  I would find out some way that I was screwing up in social interactions, or something that was causing me to repel people, and I would make a note to avoid doing that thing.  Over the years, this has resulted in my now being what one would consider socially normal, but also entirely generic.  In any social situation, I spend all my effort to ensure that I don't step on any toes, that I don't say anything offensive, that I don't say anything inappropriate, and this has not only turned all social situations into events that are exhausting and frustrating, but also has resulted in a large portion of my identity being hidden from people who know me (or at least think they do).

I know there are ""friends"" I have that are always depressed and don't ever hide it, and they completely drain me.  Eventually, no one wants to be around someone who is always miserable.  Therefore, I go through significant efforts to make sure that almost no one knows how depressed I really am, because I don't want to lose the few friends I do have because I'm always such a downer.

In addition, I know there are people who are drawn to me but who also exhaust me.  They just drain me emotionally, as I am always trying to be nice to them, but I wish I never had to deal with them and that they would just go away.  My natural inclination is to assume that anyone that I actually do want to be around feels this way about me.  I basically live my life assuming that I am a burden to all people that I care about, and that they would be better off and even prefer if I just disappeared.

All in all, I feel like no one would ever want to be around me if I actually let the real me show (i.e., the depressed me).  I feel like I have nothing special to offer anyone in any relationship (friendship or romantic).  Especially from the romantic standpoint, I have reasonably high standards from what I want from a girl (not unrealistic, but certainly enough to eliminate a lot of women).  I see no reason why any woman who meets these standards would be interested in a guy who is such a neurotic mess.  I see no value in myself, and I feel like I have nothing to offer anyone else, so I basically assume that I'll never get a real romantic relationship with the kind of woman that I desire.

I am not withdrawing from social situations.  On the contrary, I can't stand to be by myself anymore, so I find something to do almost every night.  I play several sports, run occasionally, and do other social interactions.  However, even hanging out with many people, I feel lonely and rejected.

I am getting to a breaking point where I am starting to put myself at risk of physical harm (I am punching things, and slamming my head against things).  I feel like I am an abject failure, and the only reason that I wouldn't seriously consider suicide is because I don't want to let down my family and people that actually do care about me.  However, I am rapidly going downhill, and I simply need advice.  I can't approach the people that actually know me because I don't want to be rejected, so I'm appealing to you, reddit.

Please forgive me for submitting such a long-winded post (my verbosity is among the many things that cause me to be a social outcast).  I will try to answer any questions that you have for me, but I must be going to bed soon, so I will attempt to answer tomorrow (I have no clue how quickly/slowly responses actually come in for these types of subreddits).  Thank you in advance for any help.


UPDATE: I have visited with the school counselor and will begin therapy twice a week with him.

I used to drink a lot, still do, just don't find much if any pleasure in it anymore. I'm usually drinking on an empty or mostly-empty stomach; by now I'm pretty indifferent to hunger so I can do it OK.
I smoke upwards of a pack a day.
I don't really see, talk to or engage with my family. I live with them. They're out for dinner for my sister's birthday right now. I didn't go -- never have anything to say when we go to eat, usually ends up in a fight.
I work in an office Monday to Friday. I usually end up spending at least an hour a day just feeling like total shit, don't get anything done. There have been times (often are) where I just feel so bad that being at work stresses the shit out of me and I have to go out and smoke a cigarette and just try and deal with the rush of (negative) emotions.

cc6nu,depression,sadandlonely,I'm depressed. Your help is appreciated.,"Short version: I'm too poor for a shrink and I'm terrified of anti-depressants. What can I do to make myself feel better? I've heard diet and exercise can help; are there any other cheap, effective steps to take? 

Long version, mainly to help me: I've been feeling down since around November. That's also when I got this terrible arthritis flare-up in my hands and feet. It hurt to walk and hold a steering wheel and type. I couldn't afford a doctor (U.S. health care sucks), so I just started taking lots of Tylenol and bought a pair of old lady shoes to make it easier to walk. I know it's vain, but that bothered me a lot; I was only 20 and I felt old and ugly. I guess I got too dependent on my boyfriend to make me feel better, because he left me in February. That was his excuse, anyway, although I found out later that he left me for another woman.

He was the first guy I'd been with, and losing him was devastating, especially since he pulled such a dick move after 2 years of a committed relationship. I haven't found anyone else since. I also don't have many friends, so I usually spend my weekends alone. I'm extremely introverted, and I have a really hard time making conversation. Obviously, this makes it hard to meet new people. I'd like to date again, but I think I'm too socially retarded.

My family has noticed that I've completely withdrawn. I don't do stuff I used to enjoy, and I rarely leave the house anymore. They want me to see a psychologist, but I barely even have the money to deal with my physical health.

cc9t6,depression,bobloblawdy,"Well, there's no risk of suicide... of the acute sort, at least.","So, uh, a throwaway, obviously. My paranoia tells me that people will identify me if I give even the most minute of details, and I'm probably not going to hold back. Fuck it.

I've lost a massive amount of weight and quit smoking in the past year or so. Sometimes I think I did it all only because of how much I enjoy punishing myself, primarily out of guilt for a variety of dumb, petty things and some terrible things. I started mixed martial arts when I got down to a good enough weight (though still very heavy), because I thought it might prepare me for the physical part of joining the military. Come to find out, I have a medical condition or two that bars my enlistment. That behind me, I really don't know what to do at all with my life. I like the technical details of fighting and all, but these days, I feel like I've lost my purpose and it's just another way to do penance (think Raging Bull).

I just got back from a foreign country with my girlfriend of several years. When we got over there, I didn't speak the language or have a lot of money, and thus nothing to do. I lived in a tiny apartment and she went to school over there. She eventually flunked out and got depressed about it and retreated into erotic fan-fiction... I mean really retreated. I was left in strange place for a long time, not knowing the language, and without the sole person whom I believed would always back me up (especially at the loneliest time of my life... and I say that with some real loneliness at my back). Naturally, I spent the remainder of my days abroad binge-drinking, chain-smoking, listening to country music, reflecting on how the bars of my balcony's guardrail look like jail bars from a low angle, and thinking about what it would be like to jump over said guardrail. After a lot of name calling and violent sex, we finally split.

She's trying to patch things up, too, but I won't let her. I feel bad for treating her poorly, and I've been telling her all this crap about me in hopes of sabotaging everything. I'm in love with her. She claims she ""loves me but isn't in love with me"" and wants to give it a chance and all that bullshit. Problem is, giving it a chance is her phoning it in over Skype, blaming me for every problem we've ever had while making longass excuses for anything she's done wrong, and pretending we're in a super-happy-funtime committed relationship 5,000 miles apart. Don't get me wrong, I love the agony of feeling that I'm alienating the woman I love from me forever, but I don't take shit from anybody, and that sounds a good deal like shit to me. I can inflict all the shame I want upon myself, thank you.

Worst of all? It's, generally speaking, true that a bitch does not constitute a mere one of my ninety-nine problems, but she was the only thing I believed I could depend on in my life. I'm good in school, but honestly, school ain't life. Further, my months of hard living actually exacerbated my medical condition (the same one that DQ'ed me from the service), and I don't know when it'll end. It inspires a lot of anxiety (think Marv from Sin City kinda, 'cept it's not just ""I'm ugly"". The condition is very different, but the predicament is the same), and it interferes with job searches and... basically everything in the real world, except kicking ass and getting your ass kicked for money (which I'm beginning to think might be my only option).

Anyhow. I feel better. Meh. Never read too many stories like that, honestly. Maybe it's interesting? Eh, I dunno, but I feel better. Meh. Bleh. Whatever.
[Just realized you might be curious about the title. Yeah, I've got a bit of a death wish. Got a pact with myself going where I can't kill myself and all, and it's one of those things I stick to because it's a real bitch to hack. Nevertheless, I always feel that pull towards ""hard-living"" and gambling and all that ""chronic suicide/provoked homicide"" nonsense, and I've always attributed it to a death wish.]

I hate that depressed people get judged and made fun of behind their backs, because I know it's going on. It's hard to make friends in this town too, there really aren't many people my age, and if they are, I don't usually identify with them.

I've been trying to find any connection with any girl to the point that I've been calling girls I normally wouldn't usually hang out with, even posting/answering ads on craigslist, which is mostly weird and sketchy. It's been six months since my last girlfriend dumped me, and I made the mistake of looking at pictures of her and the only other girlfriend I've ever had last night.

She's not been the most supportive parent (she told me I have a good life and should be grateful, and should 'get over it'), but she's trying.  After looking into a few therapists, she found one and I have an appointment.

Now, I am skeptical about therapy actually working. I don't like the idea of someone getting paid to talk to me and 'understand'-- I have friends for that. But I guess I just want to give anything a try at this point.

""Should I go on Anti-depressants?""","Okay, I know you guys aren't doctors but the doctors think I'm fine...and counsellin will help

I'll tell you guys the story though... I have some problems... depression (since I was 16 on and off.. I'm 22 now). I have serious abandonment issues and insecurities (I'm adopted, so pretty much when people say they can't talk or something, if i'm in a bad/sad mood I think they don't care about me at all) And then I have anger problems... 4 weeks ago I ended up killing a relationship that had a lot of chemistry in it but I couldn't deal with him going to the pub with friends without me, instead I kidnapped him (I was driving him home) and I didn't want him to go, so I first broke up with him, then said no I don't want to break up and tried to fix things almost immediately. Then when I couldn't, he finally called his parents (I gave his phone back to him) and I went home. I then took some pills, because I felt like all was lost, and it was all hopeless. I'm okay, but the hospital just thinks I should see a counsellor. So I've been going pretty regularly, but I don't know, I still get mad at him and when I think of him going out and stuff I still feel abandoned... thing is..we're not even dating anymore. Why do I get this angry? How come I can't control myself? Like I think I'm actually insane... but I dont know how to fix this, and when I talk to counsellors I feel really calm, so they don't see that side of me. What should I do?

ccwz3,depression,VenomXX,Est-ce que je peux parler avec toi?,"Hi. I'm not French. I just like French.
I last went on here 5 months ago. Time flies and that distresses me, because I haven't really been doing much apart from trying to get through school (I'm in year 12, doing IB, the equivalent of AS levels) and it's hard work, so haven't had much time for actually living life for fun.
Isn't it a sad reflection upon society when we spend so much time in academics? We are born, have 5 years of bliss, then go to school for at least 11 years, if not more. Most people stay on another 2, then go to uni for anything up to 12 years. Then they get a job which takes up the majority of their life until they can finally retire just in time to have a few years of being old before they die. 
See life is this amazing and mysterious thing, yet we squander it, society makes us dependant on the system for survival. I'm from the UK by the way.
Onto my proper point.
Recently, due in no small part to the sheer monotony of my life at school, I've been becoming apathetic about everything. And I genuinely mean everything. Things I should be happy about I'm not, however I suppose at times I'm getting upset about things which is something, at least I'm not completely neutral.
And every day I change my mood. Not intentionally. At the moment I'm feeling down and embracing the nihilistic outlook on life. However tomorrow I may wake up feeling positive about life, and think about the existentialist view. Recently I have no fixed viewpoints on anything, I play devil's advocate so well I don't know what I believe.

cd4o8,depression,tooanxious,"Terribly anxious, seeking advice concerning personal motivation and ideas for improvement.","Note: I apologize for the length.

I have had anxiety since I was a child, as well as panic attacks. During school I developed a high amount of social anxiety because I was terrified to humiliate myself - this began around 3rd grade and is still a problem as a college student. 

I might consider myself bipolar but I have never been properly diagnosed. No one knows about my issues because my family has the belief that psychology is another way to steal your money, and every friend I told decided I was lying in order to garner attention. I have even had a close friend who had gone through therapy for his anxiety tell me that I should just, ""get over it."" So, basically what I'm saying is that I'm terrified to tell anyone, especially at a professional level. When I did try to muster the courage to tell an authority figure (my guidance counselor in high school) she gave me the sage advice to ""participate in class more"" and that was the end of it. 

I am bitter, I suppose. The people I do know who have experienced anxiety and depression have such a huge sense of entitlement to their ""issues"" that they disregard everyone else's problems as silly compared to theirs. 

I am older now, and I am going back to college in the fall. I have to pay for school myself and I have no money for a therapist. Even if I did have the opportunity, I don't think I would have the courage - I feel like at this point I have completely sealed myself off from talking to anyone about it. I am extremely paranoid when it comes to talking to others, and I have the terrible problem of assuming people are always trying to make fun of me, humiliate me, or insult me. I think having a therapist would be the ultimate of my worst fears. 

As such, I'd like to know if there are ways that I can help myself without the use of professional help or medication. This may sound silly, but I know that if I didn't clarify, the number one answer will be ""seek help"" which I am unable to do, for financial reasons as well as personal ones. I won't do it. I am not at the right place in my life. I am not suicidal. My university has free counseling sessions, which I can take advantage of if I so choose. 

Since I know someone will recommend exercising, know that I have anxiety to the point that I cannot and will not work out anywhere out of my home, unless it's a quick stroll on the street. If there are too many people outside I get anxious and paranoid. When I was in my teens, I was terrified of becoming fat to the point of having anxiety attacks over it, and I developed what I choose to self-diagnose as an exercise obsession, eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown of sorts - an anxiety attack that lasted for many hours and left me jittery and nervous for a month. 

Because of this I am very afraid of heavy exercise and tend to get very nervous doing so. I have tried yoga, which I enjoy, but it has not helped my mental state. I had a lot of time on my hands one summer so I spent it doing yoga for 2 hours a day for 2 months. I felt very flexible, but my interactions with other people as well as my paranoia had not diminished. 

Of course if I still experienced such strong panic attacks I would probably look into medical help, but for 2 years they have mysteriously disappeared. However, I have not noticed an improvement in my mental state because of this. 

I understand that it may sound as if I don't want to improve or help myself, especially considering my aversion to professional treatment. I am worried that if I seek help it will not work. Professional treatment is my last option, so I would like to refrain from choosing this option unless I begin to have panic attacks or my life becomes considerably unlivable. 

I know this has developed into a sort of rant, but believe me when I tell you that I have never discussed the finer points of my depression and anxiety with anyone who actually accepted that I indeed had a problem. 

Finally, a summary: as an anxious individual, how can I replace my paranoid emotions with healthier ones? I have heard people say that you must train yourself to think happier thoughts. How does one do this? Shouting ""life is great"" in my head while I'm shaking from personal contact doesn't seem to help much. Joking aside I am seriously asking. 

Also, what kinds of low-impact exercise can I try to stimulate my brain a little more? And what kinds of foods are known to improve anxiety or depression? 

And lastly, what can I do to encourage myself to be more open and true to who I am? It feels as if my brain has constructed a thick wall of cement around myself so that I cannot even penetrate it. 

TLDR: I need advice on how to ""fix"" my anxiety, disregarding the obvious choice of professional help and medication.",23,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cd4o8/terribly_anxious_seeking_advice_concerning/,1276091004

cdptt,depression,SaddenedThrowaway,Horrible continuous cycle. Need advice/support/happy thoughts.,"I started typing this and it ended up being too long. So long I didn't even want to read it over. Here is the revised version.

Basically, I've been fighting depression for as long as I can remember. I refuse to get help because I have seen that some people on anti-depressants completely change and I do not want to be attached to some pill. Plus I once suffered from a serotonin overdose

Another problem is that I'm an alcoholic. I know it's a depressant and it is making it worse but I've tried quitting the longest being for 8 months and I hate my life more without it. I'm getting better though. Instead of getting plastered 7 nights a week. I'm down to 1 and only have a couple beers when I go out.

The latest problem is the girl that I have been head over heels in love with for the past 6 years left me. The girl is completely toxic though and I know it is for the best but I have never felt anything for anyone. She cheated on me, made me feel like shit, and basically left me due to symptoms of my depression and I hate to say it but I would take her back. The weird thing is I met her when I met another girl and I chose the other girl over her and loved both of them but in the back of my mind I always thought of her 24/7. So I thought I would give it a shot and we even talked about marriage.

Now I have a feeling that I'm going to slide into my horrible cycle that I have done a couple times:

Fall in love &gt; Break up (I usually dump them) &gt; Regret &gt; sleep with anything that says yes, drink all the damn time, and start doing drugs again.

I really do not know any other way to deal with this. I already have vultures texting me because they say my relationship status change on FB. I am already totaling only 6 hours of sleep in a 4 day span. 

This post is probably all over the place and I'm sorry if it's confusing. Too many emotions, thoughts, and lack of sleep

EDIT: I think the worst part is I feel I cannot tell any of my friends about this except the online friend I have had for the past 8 years because she isn't biased and wont tell anyone I actually know",5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cdptt/horrible_continuous_cycle_need_advicesupporthappy/,1276207011
cduht,depression,[deleted],"Need help with depression, and how to treat it.","I posted this originally in the needadvice subreddit, but I figured you guys might actually have a better idea of how to help.

I've struggled with depression for most of my life, to some extent or another. It waxes and wanes, but it's been a constant problem for me throughout my entire life.

This last year has been...particularly rough for me. I moved across the country with my (then) girlfriend and got a job at Disneyworld. The job was hellish, at best, but with how the job market was, I couldn't get anything else. And we needed the money, so I kept working. Meanwhile, her grad program was crazy hard, and she began to get depressed. This didn't help. The situation went on like this for almost a year, with me just getting more and more depressed - beginning to feel as though I couldn't get out of bed, tired all the time, weights tied to my arms and feet - just awful. I can't imagine I was any fun to be around.

Anyway, it all came to a head when the ex took a trip, came back manic (her bipolar resurfaced after being in remission for years), and that was the last thing needed to dump me and tell me to move back home. The kicker, though, is that because she was manic, she simply didn't care. It was a horrible way to end a 4 year relationship.

Anyway, I drove home feeling like...well, a zombie. I thought I'd been at my lowest ever before, but it's nothing compared to how I feel now. I don't have insurance, and what few antidepressants I had left over from an old prescription are almost gone. I've barely been getting out of bed - some days not even that. I know I need to get in and see a psychiatrist, but I can't afford it, have no insurance, and even if I did, the only thing that's ever even helped me a little is Wellbutrin, and that's fucking expensive.

I know ""go to the gym,"" ""Get outside,"" etc. But...Like I said, I'm barely getting out of bed most days. I've been home for three weeks, and I haven't unpacked.

I need to get better, but I don't know how. Help?

ce07x,depression,atalossforwords,How can I be more supportive to my depressed husband?,"He sent me a long note today, I know his purpose in sending it is not to scare me, but rather to share his feelings with me. He's reassured me many times that despite the feelings, he couldn't do anything to leave me stranded. My problem is that I always detract from difficult situations with humor...but I want to be there for him and I want to understand and say the right thing. I'm just not sure what that is.

**An excerpt of what he wrote:**

Personally I prefer the terminology 'cease to exist'. Wanting to die sounds so harsh to me, wanting to cease to exist feels more buttery and who doesn't like butter? 

The first occurrence of this feeling that I can remember goes back to when I was 14; two friends and I were on a trampoline and I remember feeling empty, void, absolutely worthless and unimportant. When they wanted to go inside I just stayed there. They asked me why I wasn't coming and I remember responding something about them not liking me anymore, they blew this off, said I was wrong and told me to come inside. 


These feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and hatred of my self have only grown over the years. Friends would go out for coffee and I would usually attend. I would sit and talk but I always would end up walking away without saying goodbye, just vanishing – but as I already felt invisible it did not make a difference. 


I have never led a difficult life, in fact at age 19 I owned my own house, and now at 24 I am making more money than most people I know my age as well as some people that are older than me. 

People seem to like me but I still feel worthless. 


I see people around me affecting others, each tying into some others life and having a symbiotic purpose. I on the other hand seem to exist alone with no ties into anyones hearts or minds. I feel liked and unneeded at the same time and it is a very difficult fusion of emotions to mix together. 


Most days my brain feels as if it is on fire and a black anxiety rises up inside me and I do not feel as if I can carry it any longer. It gnaws at my metaphorical soul, raping my positive feelings and aborting any hope I had laying inside. It burns and tears want to come but they can not and I know I still must function, that I must not let this thing control me but I fear that I am not strong enough any maybe not willing enough to fight it.",17,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ce07x/how_can_i_be_more_supportive_to_my_depressed/,1276275832

cecnr,depression,bitterpilltoswallow,"I need to unload a bit about my lonely life.  Sorry for the length...I just want to tell ""someone.""  Can anybody relate or help?  ","Dear Reddit, I just need to pour this out anonymously to someone.  I guess I am depressed (?), but I feel like I alternate wildly between being really angry (sometimes) and just defeated, deflated, and sad (often).  I can actually feel a profound heaviness in my chest.  I snap easily at people, but then I also cry at the drop of a hat over the silliest things that I see or hear.  And I do ridiculous stuff like listening to cry-inducing songs on repeat hoping I'll reach catharsis.  Sometimes I don't know how I hold it together.  I almost had a breakdown at a coffeeshop the other day when I must've looked so pitiful that the barista said ""You look sad...is everything okay?""   

I don't think I would ever commit suicide because I do believe that I can make things better for myself somehow (?!)....but I still entertain the idea as a ""fantasy.""  I like to think about how it would give people pause.  And I have to admit that I like thinking about how it would jar and hurt the few people in my life, even though I'm not really that close to anyone.  I thought over time that I would just become numb to the shittiness, but instead, I've become hyper-senstitive and unstable.  I almost feel kind of paranoid.  How fucked up is this:  I like to imagine the ways that I can hurt people's feelings...but then I feel so guilty and terrible and monstrous.  I don't believe I am a good person.

Here's some background on me.  I know it will be kind of long, but I think it will help me to write it out.  (Incidentally, one of the things I find frustrating--whether it's the thought of talking to a therapist or just making small talk in the hope of pursuing friends--is that it takes so long to get people ""caught up."")

I grew up in what was basically a white trash family.  It wasn't physically abusive, but there was an alcoholic stepfather in the picture, the presence of religion, lots of redneck fighting between family members, and their general disgust that I turned out to be gay (I came out as I was graduating from HS in the 90s).  I was always a black sheep for being nerdy and not conventionally masculine.  I lived for school and did well enough to attend a good college on a scholarship.  The future looked bright, but I was also very sheltered, with a really limited worldview.  I did very well in college--on paper--but never found a true passion.  I was just good at getting As in everything, and I focused on the competition rather than the actual learning.  I also struggled with having a different class background from my peers, feeling like I was always backward and culturally ""behind"" no matter what I did.  Anger and resentment occasionally bubbled up, but despite this, I enjoyed a close-knit group of friends in college--a little coterie of about 6 people.  It seemed like we did everything together.  I guess I had mistakenly thought that the rest of life would be like college:  that I'd always have a core group of friends, a default set of people who were like a family to me, considering that I no longer saw my own family.  I've lost that and worry I'll never find it again.

Ever since I graduated from college, going on ten years now, things have slowly crumbled apart.  I had a good job for about two years before quitting, but then I really dicked around, unsure how to proceed.  There was a new plan every couple of months, and it seemed like I never finished anything I started.  This went on for about 7 years.  I began a grad program and quit.  I'd start a job and then leave after six months.  I'd decide I didn't like the city I was in, and then I'd pick up and move.  I think that every time I did this, I was looking for a fresh start, hoping that it would somehow magically be like college and that I'd quickly find a group of friends.  I had a lot of random sex (always protected though I had a lot of different partners).  Sometimes I'd make one good friend for a period, and we'd spend time together constantly in a weird intense platonic friendship way.  But it always ended when someone moved, or there was a falling out, or the friend got a boyfriend.  I never became part of any group...to this day, I only have one friend in my city, and we only hang out together, alone, separate from his other friends who are big partiers.  I guess I was/am kind of like a serial monogamist but with friendships.  And this whole time, I never dated anyone longer than a couple of months.  After I have sex with a guy a couple of times, I find him uninteresting or just annoying.  And if I date someone and begin to care about him emotionally, I lose all sexual attraction to him.  I'm also feeling increasingly unattractive myself and am beginning to put on some weight, though I'm only at 5-10 185 right now when I used to be 5-10 165.  I don't look awful yet, but my friend told me I was ""letting myself go.""

What else...well...I was in terrible debt a few years back (from never keeping a steady job) and had to declare bankruptcy.  While that sucks, it did allow me to get a fresh start, and I am managing my money better.  I was able to start grad school with a smidge of renewed clarity and I think I have a direction for the future (though I've been slow to look for internships and part time work).  I also ended up in a good roommate situation.  So there are upsides to my current situation. 

But I've been in this city (a large one) for several years now, and it still sucks.   I feel so alone and helpless.  Meanwhile, I see all these other people who are happy and active, whether it's straight married couple walking their kids or gaggles of gay guys out for a night on the town.  I don't seem to enjoy the things that others enjoy....I don't like going to bars, and I don't like drinking.  I'm not sportive.  I can't stand theater or even movies.  It's summer, and I don't even like these stupid outdoor festivals that everyone is obsessed with.  I hate dinner parties and other pretentious shit that a lot of the gay guys I encounter are into.  (One of the sub-themes is that I really resent gay culture because of how superficial it feels.)  I sometimes feel like I am defined by what I dislike rather than what I like.

Meanwhile, all of my friends from college are living these absurdly charmed lives.  They're attorneys, consultants, professors, pharmacists, journalists, and so on.  And now they're mostly married and have popped out a kid or two.  They own condos and houses and seem so thrilled by it all.  They've made it look so easy and natural.  I am jealous on one hand, but I also don't want the same things they do...it seems like they've stopped being interesting people. 

A few more things: I'm tremendously impatient with people.  I judge quickly, even though I know I shouldn't.  I have a hard time finding other people who share my values.  I'm an atheist.  I also don't see the appeal of alcohol, and I never use drugs or smoke pot.  I'm not a ladder climber and don't really want to make a lot of money.  I just want to have a job that I enjoy that doesn't make the world any worse and that will pay me enough to live comfortably on (for me that would be $40-45k a year after I'm done with my master's).  

What really gives me the sinking feeling is when I see lonely old people lugging their stuff to the laundry mat or counting change for coffee at McDonald's.  I worry that I will be like that, with no one to care about except a cat or two.

Okay, well....there's obviously more, but I don't want to take up everyone's entire day...this was long enough as-is!  Thanks for letting me dump out all this shit.  I'll take any thoughts or suggestions.  [I suppose I could pursue counseling through my university, but one of the people who works in the counseling center is in my graduate program as a student.

When I fell too depressed, I usually ended up in bed because, while I was sleeping, I wasn't thinking about my problems. Now that the summer is back, I get up and I either run or use my rollerblade or my bike. I found out that exercise is quite a good way to fight depression.

cg8dt,depression,WARTYAWOH,I'm tired.,"I'm tired.


I've been fighting depression and anxiety since I was in middle school (30 now). 


I was in a 5 1/2 year relationship which imploded due to my depression and my inability to get my shit together. That was 1 1/2 years ago. I am still madly in love with my ex and have recurring nightmares about losing her (I've cut off all contact with her).


It took me 9 years to get my BFA in graphic design, a field that I never wanted to be in the first place. I was extremely good at it, to the point where I easily got internships at top design firms. I hated it, but was good at it. That is why I stuck with it.


$5,000 a month allowance from my wealthy parents for the majority of my adult life has fucked me over. I finally cut myself loose because the free money was killing my sense of self worth.


I've been financing my life for the past two years with credit card debt and odd jobs. However my debt is growing, $60,000 and counting. 


I struggle with my work ethic every fucking day. I can barely hold a job for longer than a month, because I'd become depressed, anxious and just drop out. 


My physical health is good. I regularly run and swim, and am rather cut.


I've gone to therapy, been on countless of medication, tried everything I could think of to get better. In a way I am better, but lately (over the past several months) I'm beginning to lose it again. 
 

I'm tired.


I'm fairly good looking and get laid now and then, but I've since become discontented with random and not so random sex. My ex set the bar so high, nothing else compares (and yes I've reminded myself of all bad things that transpired during the relationship, but she gives me an immense satisfaction that I am unable to find in another person).


I struggle with constant ennui (a form of depression), I've had numerous of hobbies and interests but they alway fall to the wayside.  It's extremely frustrating because I know that I'm more than capable of learning new skill and hobbies, but nothing holds my attention for long. So I've become a mediocre jack of all trades, master of none.


I have a respectable number of friends who love me (and vice versa), but sometimes it's a burden to hang out with them. 


I've come far in the past 2 years but I've hit a plateau, and feel like I'm spinning my wheels in a sandy incline. Slowly sliding backwards.


I'm slowly growing more cynical, bitter, and discontented with myself and life in general. I'm tired of fighting so hard all the damn time. 


I promised myself that I won't think about suicide (there were one serious attempt and countless of flirtations). Haven't seriously thought about it for two years, but lately they have been cropping up again.


I'm the kind of person who plays a perfect game and will reload a saved game if I make a mistake. I feel the same thing about my life. Due to a series of bad choices, I'm thirty years old with shitload of debt, no career, no passion and no idea where to head next. I feel like I've fucked up, and my options are restricted.


Life has stopped feeling like an adventure for a long time (since I was a teen, actually). Now I'm just fighting, going through the motions. For what? In a million years, none of this will matter. I'm an atheist and see the world as a largely deterministic place with discrete bits of information smashing into each other giving rise to different variables.


I'm tired of being constantly dispirited. I'm tired of not having something I can look forward to. I'm tired of fighting my mental illness.


Before you guys freak out and track down my IP to call the cops on me. I'm not in danger, nor really desire death.

cgnem,depression,anonbcofobvs,Does having suicidal thoughts automatically mean that you're depressed?,"For a long time, I've had the occasional suicidal thought. It usually happens when I'm sad or unhappy about something, and I don't see any solution for fix to the underlying problem -- I just have to accept it and move on, but in the meantime I'm sad. And while I'm sad and feeling helpless, I will sometimes think about killing myself.

An example: I broke up with a girl when she moved away last year, and since then we've been talking on and off. Rationally, I don't see any way that we will get together again -- I want to, and she says that she could possibly see it happening one day, but at the moment she has a boyfriend and wants to see where things go with him. Meanwhile, I'm graduating in a year and need to start looking for jobs, but those jobs will likely not be near where she is living.

So all of this makes me sad. Yet, for whatever reason, I'm unable to move past the idea of being with her. So I'm sad about it. I'm sad when I hear about things that she's doing with her boyfriend, I'm sad when I talk to her and she says that she and her boyfriend are having problems but she's confused as to what to do and isn't breaking up with him.

And so at night when I'm falling asleep, I think about just killing myself. Stabbing, gunshot, etc. Running away into a remote part of the country and killing myself in a shallow grave so that it looks like I just disappeared and my parents don't know that I killed myself. All sorts of things.

I know that I'd never go through with this sort of thing - I could never do it to my family. It would destroy my mom and dad. So, I *know* that I won't do it. I just think about it.

Is this... normal? It's not a new thing (i just picked one example of something that triggers these thoughts now). I've had these types of thoughts for at least 10 years, in varying amounts depending on whether I'm sort of profoundly sad or not. 

I was about to say that I function just fine on a day to day basis... but then I realized that it's not true. I didn't do any work today, didn't do any yesterday, and in fact only did about 4 hours of real work this entire week. I still go to work, and sit at my desk, and socialize as normal... but I don't really accomplish anything. And I should -- I have plenty to do. I'm just not doing it.

I saw a therapist last year, but it was for ""crisis counseling"" or something and at the time I was dealing with relationship issues with a girl, and getting over the girl before her. Maybe I am depressed? 

I've just always assumed that the occasional suicidal thought wasn't a big deal, because I knew I would never act on it. It's just an idea that pops into my head, and then I think about the practical aspects of it and end up dismissing it. But a friend said something about how their dad is having suicidal thoughts and so he's depressed, and I never thought that those two things were linked definitively like that. Are they?

Thanks for any thoughts that you have. I'm going to go to bed, but I'll check this tomorrow at some point, so don't freak out if I don't reply to things :P ",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cgnem/does_having_suicidal_thoughts_automatically_mean/,1276922495
cgsep,depression,rewted,"Keep getting switched between meds, and feeling hopeless","Hi all,

I recently posted in askreddit basically talking about how I'm down in the dumps, and finding life hard to cope with. One of the guys on there recommended I talk to your lovely selves about how I'm feeling.

In general, I'd be happy one minute - and drop off the face of the planet the next. It's like a voice in my head would actually say ""why are you happy?"", and it drops. Having been switched between lexapro, lustral, effexor and now back to lexapro, I'm finding it hard to basically believe in happiness - in my mind, it's just another chemically induced state.

This normally then leads down darker paths - why be happy when eventually I'm going to die and my consciousness will cease to exist. And eventually to suicidal thoughts. It's like a switch flicking in my head, and I'm terrified I'm going to lose control and kill myself.

It's now my 5th day back on lexapro, and I'm feeling no better at all. The only thing these meds have done so far is stop the panic attacks (thankfully), but seem to have replaced it with full depression.

Has anyone ever been in the same boat, can you offer any advice or recommendations?

Properly, I need advise with psychiatric consultation that I plan on doing shortly.","I actually need advise on how to go about getting psychiatric help. I have had some traumatic experiences as a teen and and there is a lot of shame that was drilled into me after that ""incident"" - which was sexual molestation. 

It has made me someone with very low self esteem, ever-angry with everything, and lonely. Without job for the last 1 year, with slightly bad case of back+neck pain, which I have worsened because I won't exercise regularly.  All in all I am in a very shitty place in life. I have a internet girlfriend, which is the only silver lining in my life. I am not suicidal really but life stinks. Its drudgery, what with me sitting here feeling my back and neck hurting me typing away. I have ADD in case you wonder, I always want something to do.

I really don't know what to write here, so maybe this is TMI, so bear with me. Here is the real post: ( to give some coherence to this, am gonna number it) 

1. I am now gonna finally see a psychiatrist. But I am really clueless about how it will go - I don't trust people, though I can e candid, there is a chance I will react badly to someone trying to influence me ( I try to be a alpha male always, failing miserably. I am not a jerk - but passive-aggressive. Fired from two jobs because of that and social ineptitude). 

2. I don't wanna pussyfoot around my experience of sexual molestation - its something I have NEVER talked with anyone. Maybe posted on one two comments anonymously, but to talk to anyone about it is something never done. What I wanna do is go into the first meeting and just tell him/her that first thing - I would really hate for some expectation to build in which the psych tries to coax out a secret from me a la Good Will Hunting.

**Is that how its supposed to work**? 

Can anyone outline how psychiatric sessions or things go, with someone like my history? 

I may ask more questions later, thanks. 

Oh yea, I am somewhat depressed so its not a wrong subreddit. I am not as bad to need SW help. The worst I think to do is go on a killing rampage, of the ""molester"", mine and others who I hear about :P Don't worry its nothing too bad, just a fantasy world of a overactive imagination.

cit0u,depression,pukeko,It comes in waves (just a rant),"Some nights are worse than others. Depression runs in my family. My parents both take medications, but I refuse to take pharmaceuticals for depression anymore. My parents had me on anti-depressants when I was in elementary school and I tried again in high school. I did not like how it made me feel.
I started seeing a naturopath and went on a bunch of supplements (including 5-htp and vit d) but that all became too expensive and I'm only taking vitamin d now.

I've been exercising a lot lately and eat well for the most part (though I'm trying to lose some weight that I've recently gained and constantly feel gross about the way I look). I have been staying with family since I just graduated while I look for a job. I do not like living with family. I just got out of a long-term relationship and miss having someone to hold hands with, cook with, watch movies with, fall asleep and wake up next to. I have no friends here and don't know how to go about making any now that I'm not forced into social situations like I was in school.

Some nights I'll lay in bed and wonder who I can text to say how miserable I feel and to get some comfort. But, I never text anyone because I realize how ridiculous and pathetic it would make me sound. And I don't have someone I can confide in that much anyway. My best friend passed away some years ago and I have never met anyone else I could completely open up to (bestf was depressed too, so we were able to confide and comfort each other.. for the most part).

Sometimes I think that the reason it's so hard to grow above this is because it's genetic. Sometimes I feel that it's only because I'm god damn lonely and bored. But it's like a cycle: because I feel so down, I don't want to go out or do anything. In high school, I secretly ""dealt"" with these depressive feelings in harmful ways. In college, I spoke to a psychiatrist but mainly for my anxiety issues. I did not want to admit to him that I was depressed, and I still don't want to admit to anyone I know. I feel like I don't want outside help, but wouldn't mind advice from reddit. I want to fix this issue myself because I'm tired of drowning in these awful feelings. But those urges I sometimes have to tell my parents (the urges usually come at night) reside because they will just make me go back to a ""doctor"" to get prescribed on pharmaceuticals, and that's not what I want at all. Plus, I wouldn't want them to worry too much about me. I don't want these feelings covered up (through pharmaceutical-use), I want to get to the root of the problem and fix them from there, but I'm not sure how to go about that.

Over the years, I have figured out how to be cool and relaxed among all kinds of people, and as a result I can fit in with a lot of different crowds, and decide who I like most, befriending them as I please. 

This is more of a hindrance than a blessing, however. I have learned to master human interaction, but I did so in a way that allows me to make friends and build relationships without improving myself as a person. I basically know nothing and can do even less. I grew with the mindset that getting people to like me is my ultimate goal in life, and I guess it never occurred to me that having interests is important. 

The people around me have goals and passions and interests. They could spend all day reading books on their favorite subjects, playing their favorite sports or practicing a skill they value. I can't really do anything. I never tried in school because I just wanted a social life, and as a result I am a loser who dropped out of university. If I don't have a party to go to, or plans with friends or my girlfriend, I go home to my computer, killing time before bed.

There are things I wish I could do, and subjects I would like to know more about, but when I consider starting on something, I get really depressed.

I started thinking about how pointless it would be to try, and how I would probably give up on it like always. Then that same old train of thought came along and made me hate myself again, as it does whenever I am alone. I just lay on my bed and hated myself for a half hour. 

I do this whenever I try to do something. When I try to get myself to work out, read a book, practice things like drawing or music - anything at all challenging.  I can not learn. I can not grow. I am hopeless. Doomed to be like a little child forever and watch the people I care about out-grow me. I'm miserable, and add nothing to the world. No one wins in this situation.

Even my siblings are too busy to see me. I am bored/lonely to the point of insanity.

Everyone I know has somebody else that they would rather see. I have nobody. I have nothing. I’m lonely and pathetic.

cjlnq,depression,alaskamiller,When and where is the line?,"The thing about dreams is that when it's good--when it's really, really good, when it's just me and her again sitting somewhere safe staring at warm colors--is that you inevitably wake up to it and realize how much you wished it was a nightmare. Because then at least my life would be better in comparison.

Some days it's good, I have my windows down, volume up, and Zeppelin roaring and everything--even me--is in its place. But some days, like today, it's just a light switch turning on and off in my brain. I'm just out of step with everyone else. A bright and sunny Sunday is wasted because I'm holed up in my room. 

Why do I insist on loving her when I have to ask every day why doesn't she love me? I know she's not the cure to my disease but am I unlovable? Am I unfixable? Am I just not worth anything? People reassure me but I can't trust them. I rarely ever trust compliments. People don't know me, they see something superficial, make a remark, but don't get the underlying motivations or how really broken I am. I feel if I was honest about everything--and in moments where I am--it will just send them running. I can't be myself, my real self is horrible, it aches for love, it lacks self esteem, it self loathes, it consistently fails, it is jealous, it is envious, it is incorrigible, it is base, it is inconsiderate, it is selfish. My internal bad cop is tired of keeping all that in check through threats.

To make up for all that I go out of my way to make up love, I do things for people and get treated like a door mat after they're done being surprised how nice I am. I tell them I give them the benefit of doubt but they abused it and treated me with disrespect. They shrug and move on with their life. It speaks more about their character than mine but when that kind of behavior becomes a pattern what can I do to not be cynical?

Am I broken? What is wrong with me? I spent all night online taking tests trying to validate what I am, how I feel. Am I depressed? 30% occurrence in the population. Am I type 2 bipolar? 1% occurrence in the population. Am I sociopathic? 3% occurrence in the population. Do I have social anxiety disorder? Am I INFJ? 1% occurrence in the population. Am I type 4 but borderline unhealthy type 2 personality? What if the online quizzes are right and I really am the weirdest, worst, most off person in the world. What a way to spend a Saturday night, doing mental masturbation instead of porn.

I've always felt sad my whole life and thought this was just how life is suppose to be. People tell me to suck it up and deal with it because life sucks for everyone. I never know what the line is, like when do I know I've crossed a line that requires actual medical intervention? I've operated on this path for so long but it's tiring. I'm too tired to shoulder all this myself. Is it time to see a therapist or a doctor, I don't even know where, when, and who to ask for help? Or is this how people really operate?

I've never had sex either (I'm 18) and when all my friends appear to be doing so, I feel as though I'm missing out on something big, and I've been made to feel like a loser for not having lost my virginity in the past.


My mum and dad don't help matters in the slightest. They criticise 90% of what I do and make me feel worthless. They make me feel as though they'd rather I didn't exist.

cjxv7,depression,childhoodtrauma000,Coping mechanisms from childhood trauma not working so well in young adulthood. Help?,"Hey /r/depression, I'm gonna go out on a limb and request some serious advice.

A little back story. My father died when I was five years old, at which point my mother became an alcoholic. This progressed for a few years, getting worse and worse until she became pretty obviously suicidal. I have lots of bad memories from this time of my life, such as:

- My mom falling down the stairs (drunk), me hearing the noise and coming to see what it was, seeing her unconscious body at the bottom of the stairs with a lot of blood pouring out of her face. I was home alone so I had to call the ambulance to take her away. I think I was eight at the time.

- Having to run home from school at lunch time to put my mother (who would be drunk) to bed, so that when the neighbour's kids came over (they ate lunch at our house) they wouldn't have to see her.

- Her collapsing in the kitchen and cracking her head open on the table. Again, blood everywhere.

- Her repeatedly telling me she wanted to die, to which I would reply ""when you say that, it makes me want to die too"". I was 10 at the time.

Needless to say, I wasn't a very happy kid from ages 6 to about 11. One morning, I woke up late for school and went upstairs to see why my mom hadn't woke me up (she normally did at this point in my life). I found her unconscious in her bedroom, half on her bed and half on the floor, with an open pill bottle tipped over and pills all over the floor. I tried to wake her but she didn't respond. I called the ambulance and they carted her away, and luckily she didn't die.

After that, social services split my family into a few different temporary homes. I lived with a neighbour for a few weeks, and my two brothers and two sisters went to live with friends. My mom was sent to rehab, and she managed to get the treatment and help she needed. She came home a few weeks later, and she hasn't relapsed into her alcoholism or suicidal tendencies since then.

I'm 22 now, and I'm doing a lot of introspection about my childhood. Specifically, I'm trying to identify all the behaviours I used back then to help cope with the emotional trauma. I've noticed that every serious relationship I've ever had has disintegrated over time, because I tend to grow distant and drift away from the girl I'm dating.  Part of me thinks that it's related to my childhood, given that isolation and escapism were the ways I learned to cope with bad things going on around me. I recently had a 2-year relationship implode on me because I couldn't emotionally connect with her anymore. I had become depressed and distant, and let the relationship die over the span of a few months. I just stopped caring about anything. Now, I'm trying to pick up the pieces and move forward, hopefully never making the same mistake again.

So...if you're still here, thanks for reading all that. I guess my main question is, how do you unlearn the behaviours that originated as a result of childhood emotional trauma, when they are clearly not beneficial to my life anymore? I'm reading books on cognitive behaviour therapy at taking 20mg Citalopram daily for depression, but I still barely feel like I have the capacity to be intimate with anyone anymore. Can anyone give me some advice? Has anyone been through something similar?

The only real research I have done is on wikipedia, and I don't really feel like I've learned much. I know that I don't want to take anti-depressants (like prozac and stuff). I've tried them before and hated them. I really think that depression is just a symptom that is resulting from all the other psychological problems I've had all my life.

clpk6,depression,throwaway45678,Just need to get this out.,"I hate mornings like these. The mornings where you get up, go about your day, do things, and all of the sudden sitting at your computer screen it hits you. Some thought, some fucking tiny inconsequential thought, and you start sobbing. It happens to me, a couple of times a week, seemingly always in the early morning. The tiny little thought, the first one, begins this snowball effect. A thousand other thoughts, the ones you've happily pushed to the back of your mind, follow it and begin tumbling down in this cascade, creating a snowball effect that rolls you up with it. You can't stop it. You can't get away from it. All you can do is wait it out and hope that when you get to the bottom of the hill you're still in one piece.

Doctors and therapists have always had trouble understanding my depression. They claim my problem is that I keep it to myself, that I lock it in so hard and put on such a happy face that when it finally hits it's like releasing the floodgates. They say it's strange that I don't present any of the classical suicidal tendencies. And there's the problem. I'm not suicidal. I haven't been for a long time. Instead, when these episodes hit, I simply wish I didn't exist. I look in the mirror, at a face and body I have hated every waking moment of my existence, and I look around my apartment and the stupid little life I've built for myself. I look at the friends I have, my pets, my family, my things, and I just wish I didn't exist.

Killing myself is too difficult an option. It would hurt too many people. It would effect too many lives and create a logistical mess. It's not something I would want to put on anyone's shoulders. Instead, I just wish I had never been born. I wish I didn't exist. I wish that my soul or my mind or my consciousness or whatever the fuck you want to call the spark of intuition that makes me human had never entered this body. I wish my life had never started. I just wish I didn't exist.

And this is my problem. When I get to this point. When I am so paralyzed with all of the self-loathing I feel, the crippling sadness which comes when entertaining the thought of suicide, the point where it becomes hard to breathe so all I can do is stand under the running water of the shower and sob. I'm told I should seek out help from friends, surround myself with people who love me. When I get to this point, how am I supposed to explain it to someone? How on earth can I ask someone to help me when it's my own mind that's attacking me and I can't make it stop?

And it's only escalated by the weddings that I play at with my band. I do love playing with my band, but it makes the hurt worse when I spend an evening pouring my heart out into playing music, watching newlyweds, couples young and old, married and unmarried, dancing joyously and having a great time. I play my instrument and I sweat and I feel invisible onstage only to come home to an empty apartment and feel invisible there. The days and weeks I spend sitting alone in my apartment because it's cheaper to stay at home and feel lonely than to go out into public, be reminded that I don't have anyone to spend time with, and feel even more lonely.

And these mornings. After strings of failed job interviews, getting dicked around, being told that I'm worthless as an employee. A stinging remark from a friend about a neighbor's cooking being better than mine, even if it's true. Knowing that I'm playing with a fucking wedding band. I'm not really good at anything, I have no real talents that aren't overshadowed by thousands of people around the world who can do what I do so much better than myself. Empty inboxes on Facebook, OKCupid, and Gmail alike. A complete digital ghost town waiting for me here in my only refuge to gently remind me exactly how worthless I am to this world. How much of a waste of resources I am. How little I give back.

I don't know why every year I expect something to happen on the holidays, because really, it never does. I'm house sitting, which I kinda got forced into. I moved in with my second family on the 25th, and they went on a trip to Idaho the 30th. They have pets, so even though they said ""We weren't sure if you'd be here or not."" I think they did, and were going to leave me here so they wouldn't have to pay anyone to take care of the house. The mother texted me this morning (she knows I'm depressed too) saying ""Happy 4th of July. This one will b lame for u."" I'm sure she didn't mean it to sound mean, but it really pissed me off, as if she was rubbing it in my face or something. Like, I know it'll suck, I don't need you to remind me. If she were trying to console me, she could have said ""Sorry you're alone, but it'll be okay"" or something to that effect. 

I grew up pretty poor, and never really had family aside from mom, so holidays weren't christmas trees, giant turkey dinners with family, or fireworks. My mom did what she could, but I've never had a holiday like the ones on TV, which I guess makes me ungrateful, but have always wanted. When my mom died, holidays just became worse for me, and even though I've been invited to dinners from friends, its not the same. I always decline, because I know the invitation is out of pity. I would just feel awkward being around a family, and being the only one that isn't...family. 

My first birthday party ever was my 21st birthday. I'm alone on this 4th of July (of course) and all it reminds me of is when I was a kid, I would sit at my apartment room window, and try and catch glimpses of Fireworks I wish I had. 

I think I'm just ranting, because I feel taken advantage of. That I was just left alone (I can't drive, I have no license) for a week with nothing to do except to take care of the house. It was thrown upon me too, like...they didn't ask me to, it was just assumed that I would have no choice. I'm probably gonna go get some beer or something, and just drink tonight. I've been drinking the past few nights, but not getting drunk. What else do I have to do tonight anyway?

I'm glad that's over with.  It was incredibly emotional/uncomfortable.  I'm sure you can imagine.  Anyway, I agreed to talk to somebody.  My mother is the one taking care of setting up the appointment and there was only one place she could get me in this soon.  Every other place was booked for the next 2 months.  We only got an appointment because another person cancelled or at least that's what I was told.  

I'm not really sure about the qualifications of where I'm going or if they can help at all.  Here's what they're listed under in the yellow pages: *Counselors-Licensed Professional,Marriage, Family, Child &amp; Individual Counselors,Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Psychiatry,Medical Clinics*.  Should I even bother with a place like this?  I really don't feel like wasting my parent's money.

What kind of things should I be looking for when searching for help in case this place doesn't work out?

My appointment is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon and I'll be going if I think it won't be a waste of time.  What should I look for in a quality professional?  What types of questions will they ask when we first meet?  What should I expect from this?  Oddly enough, going to a crumby psychologist might just push me over the edge.  I'm tired of trying things and having them not work out.  I think I'm fine for awhile.  That intervention felt a lot like I was sitting in on my own wake.

cn3fn,depression,downerguy,A promising youth and a dismal adulthood,"I was a bright kid, as bright as most ever encounter. I had the gift of being extremely savvy in all of my scholastic and personal pursuits. I was a happy kid.

Today I am in college and have lost all motivation. I am perpetually in pain (back, abdominal, joint, headaches) and often feel confused. Sometimes I'll lie in bed and (when seemingly everything is going splendidly) feel like I am having an out of body experience. Despite being very careful and thoughtful in what I do, I find myself to be increasingly accident prone. I have gotten in two car accidents (both moderately serious) and find that I cut or bruise myself in the course of my everyday life. I have switched from an engineering major to liberal arts because, despite not finding the material exceedingly difficult, I would fail most of the tests due to brain fog.

I have no idea if this is depression or something else. I have seen a few GP's, a neurologist, a psychologist, and a psychiatrist. I have taken a smörgåsbord of drugs, antidepressants and otherwise, with no significant advancement. They've done the basic blood work as well as MRI/EEG/Neuropsych tests. I find myself getting insanely angry at the littlest annoyances in my life and putting all of my energy into not acting on that anger. Still, it's strained my relationships. I rarely hang out with what few actual friends remain. They don't contact me much, if ever, but I think that's mostly due to my past hesitance to socialize. Whenever I go out I inevitably wish I were just at home surfing the web and going to bed at my normal time and place.

Yesterday my parents were finally let in on how bad my depression was at my psychologists office.  I had hid it well until then.  I never made my mom cry before I admitted to having suicidal thoughts.  I felt a little bit better today now that they know everything but I still can't get rid of this kind of existential angst that is surrounding me.  I am just some white kid, in a sea of people.  I have nothing really that makes me stand out.  I feel like the definition of below average/under achiever.

I regret so much that year and my how I handled myself in high school/middle school, with all the social withrawl.  Just when I thought I got over my social anxiety it came back harder than ever.

cnat0,depression,[deleted],"Reddit, i'm not doing very well right now...the despair is overwhelming me.","Hey folks - naturally a throw-away account.  I periodically post here, spend some time in sw trying to offer some words of wisdom and i know i suffer and have suffered from unipolar depression and am, at the moment, taking 50mg of Lamitrogine to combat the mood problems.

But, the past week has just worn me down...and it began 4 days after I saw the psych doc and we decided to stay at this dose and 2 days after I saw my therapist and my mood was stable, i was optimistic and well grounded.

Then it all just crashed around me.  I made a job change about 6 months ago (inside the same company) from being a kinda behind the scenes bond analyst to something more salesy where it requires more personal interaction.  I'm not complaining about my job but when i feel this much despair it is so hard to stay motivated.  I am a more introverted person, but this job requires more extroversion.  I am just not motivated to try...then i feel lazy because i'm not trying...it's a vicious cycle.  

At the moment, i have lost a bit of perspective.  I know i've lost perspective, but at the same time it seems like times like this help provide some clarity on my life.  The trouble is, when i come out of these times I feel optimistic, have a plan, have the drive to push to that plan and then in peters out...i lose all the drive, feel like the plans can't be hit or aren't realistic and feel like i'm trying to fool someone by even trying...

In fact, i don't want this to come across as a pity party.  I know that having a wife, 2 pretty good kids, a job and a house (as much as these things can be annoying) makes me pretty lucky.  I know all that...but something is broken inside.

I want to change my work situation but i've lost the drive and the optimism that i can actually do that.  I sit down to study for the CFA and i'm having trouble concentrating on the material...then my mind just wanders to the place that says that i can't do it.  Who am i kidding to think that i can do it.  But if I can't (my mind says to me) then what the hell am i going to do?

I'm not even sure what i enjoy anymore...i'm not even sure what i want to do anymore.  Reddit, i'm 41 and feeling really hopeless.  I'm sorry for wallowing in my sorrow, but I can't seem to find any hope for anything better.

cnbn2,depression,Worthless_Useless,"Thank you, depression reddit!","About a month ago, I was at my wit's end, feeling lonely, worthless, obnoxious, and pretty much like a total failure.  I was starting to injure myself, and was beginning to toy with suicidal thoughts.  In a desperate attempt for help, I came to this reddit and asked for advice.  The responses were very encouraging, and I was given some excellent advice.  Most of you suggested I see my school counselor.

I did go see the school counselor, and I am still visiting him at least once a week.  The counseling has been immensely helpful.  Beyond that, he referred me to a psychiatrist who has put me on new ADD medication (which is working much better than my old), and has also put me on antidepressants.  I also decided to move out of my parents house and into my own apartment, which has helped me as well.  Finally, I had a friend randomly tell me a couple of weeks ago, apropos of very little, that apparently I'm a very popular person among my social circle, and that people love having me around (ironically, he said one of the things that most people love is my confidence).

Things have really turned around for me.  I am re-energized, confident, and in reasonably good spirits.  I needed a change of perspective that I obtained from the school counselor, and, while I am far from recovered, I am making good strides and am incredibly optimistic.

I say all of this for two reasons.  First, I want to thank everyone here for their advice, as it was the impetus I needed to get me started on the recovery path.  Secondly, I want to let those who are currently in a bad place know that while they may be really hurting right now, things won't always be so bleak.  There is hope, and things can turn around!

So why do I feel so awful?","I apologize for typing this on a throwaway account, but everytime I start to type this on my main, I would freeze up and just close the browser. Maybe this way I can put what's on my mind up.

I'm 26 years old and I recently quit my job of 3 years to persue greener pastures: Something, anything that could feel like I've actually accomplished something and be satisfied with it. I felt that the job atmosphere was toxic and I just wasn't learning what I felt were important for me to progress in life, among many other reasons. I've saved up enough and carefully planned to make sure everything would be fine and then made the leap. Combine that with living in a small town far away from anything (Due to the job's location - The joke I use is that Wal-Mart closes at night here. It's funny, but it's a fact.) and I've had a miserable time of it. I've tried my best in making this work out, but it's fallen apart; I'm terrible at socializing to begin with and shy at my best moments. I had attended therapy for depression during my stay, but I never really felt like nothing was happening beyond the exchange of money (It was also the only practice for an hour on all side, which didn't help much.)  But now, I'm returning back to where I feel I belong in hopes that I can pick up the pieces and make life feel worthwhile again. My friends there are happy to hear me returning. My family is somewhat supportive, but tend to make passive-aggressive remarks about me quitting without another job in tow, as if the job is more important than the self. I'm going to be moving back in the next couple of weeks.

So, there's a lot of hopefulness in the air. A lot of things going. Ultimately, I'm nervous and excited.  Even so, I have to fight this overwhelming feeling of worthlessness every day to get to that point. By then, I'm just so tired. I should be happy of what I am doing, but I seem to feel worse than I did before I turned in my notice. It's like I simply can't get beyond beating myself up over every little instance. It's how I've coped so long that nothing else seems to make sense. 

I'm sorry if this didn't make very much sense. I'm so tired of feeling alone and worthless for things I felt like I have no control over. And now that I'm attempting to do my own thing and live again, it feels like I can't escape.

I don't know what to do.  From the outside looking in, I should be so happy. But I really feel horrible and can't escape this suffocating self-loathing.  

I've had issues with body image for as long as I can remember.  I recently started running again (over the past couple of months), and was expecting to feel better about myself.  In reality, I feel worse! I feel fat and disgusting--and I wear the same clothes all of the time because I'm afraid to go shopping.  When I feel so sad, I just want to drink...and I know that drinking doesn't help my body size or image.

co9t4,depression,lovelockdown,I broke myself,"So spring quarter I was pretty stressed. I'd say I got burnt out for working hard the past 8 months in school to transfer to my dream college.  I didn't do so well and got a few B+s instead of the As I had hoped for. The entire time I felt like I couldn't focus, I was not in control of my mind. I went out for a drive and told myself so hard to just get started on an essay, but couldn't do it. Very bizarre.

The quarter prior I had taken Concerta for four days finals week to help me focus. I did not have a prescription but now fit the symptoms for ADD according to my therapist, but we haven't moved to getting medicated just yet because I have a history of anxiety. This quarter I couldn't concentrate without it. Cue crying for the first two weeks of summer thinking I fucked myself. But my hard work prevailed and I got into my dream school.

The problem was that I still feel like I cannot concentrate. I wrecked my car taking a turn too fast like an idiot, something I regret deeply. As a result, I can't go down to LA (dream school location) to see the girl I have a major crush on who is also interested, I'm lonely and blah.

So I decided to expand my hobby project and maybe make some decent money for another car. I feel like I forgot everything. For the past two weeks I've opened up 3ds max, photoshop, and had a hard time creating anything worthwhile. I have been able to make minimalist things, but I'm scared of even using color. I no longer have confidence in my abilities. I think I broke my head. I even had a celebrity ask me to do stuff for them, and we're still thinking about it, but I'm frozen. I have nothing. I look at my previous work and it boggles me--I don't feel like I was capable of creating it.

On a side note, I cry frequently. Feel heartache daily, and feel like a giant pussy. I spend my free time beating off to hardcore porn instead of going out. 

This will end definitely by the time I move back to LA in a little over a month. But what do I do for at least the next 1-2 weeks, when I am stuck here for sure? I feel like I can't go on and have contemplated suicide, something I've thought of in the past, even though my main goal had been accomplished. Feeling very irrational and like I'm wasting every day.

Hormonal imbalance? Permanent damage from taking prescription ADD meds? What do? I'd greatly appreciate if any redditors in the same place or someone who knows what could be happening in my head and stalling me from reaching my dreams again could help.

tl;dr Heartache daily, can't focus to make money to buy nice things, missing invaluable opportunities, designer's block, feel like I fried my brain by taking ADD drugs without a prescription. I keep procrastinating and hate doing what I used to love doing (web and iPhone app design), feel like I'm useless.

cor3m,depression,itshurtsithurts,"I can't think of a cool title, and this is going to be a long post. ","I got into an enormous fight with my mom, and just sort of lost my shit on her.  I went a little overboard and told her I hated her and hoped I never saw her again, but honestly, I'd been dreaming about saying that to her for years...and instead of regret, I feel relief.  So, before you think I'm just the god of douches, here's the background:

* My parents split when I was 10 and my mom was in with this new woman (lesbians) within days.  We moved in with the new woman in less than a month. 

* The new woman and my mom fought like cats and dogs, almost daily.  Screaming, yelling, name-calling, threats, etc.  Unfortunately for me, their favourite place to do this was in my bedroom.  I took to playing slipknot (I don't even like slipknot!) at full volume and downing bottles of vodka to try to get them out. 

* They made me sell my drums and get rid of my dog - and I had to be the one to make the calls in both cases.  They made me admit to the dog's breeder that I wasn't able to keep him. 

* I started self-injuring.  My mom would ground me when she found cuts, so I started doing it in less noticeable places.  A few teachers and camp counsellors noticed it but nobody ever reported it. 

* I was sexually assaulted by a school mate and they talked me out of pressing charges - instead the police just had me switch schools and the new principal promised me I'd be safe there.  The guy then switched into my school, and my parents refused to see my principal about it.  I had to advocate for myself - but unfortunately the only option was to switch schools again (which I refused to do, but then became increasingly depressed)

* The fighting between my parents got even more out of control and they started targeting me - chasing me around the house screaming and calling me names.  

* One particularly stressful night, I started taking pills and alcohol - a sort of miserable suicide attempt.  I changed my mind about 10 pills in, but I didn't know what kind of damage that might do, so I admitted to my mom what I'd done.  She was *furious* and drove me to the hospital, where I had to drink some chalk.  She told me what to tell the social workers to avoid getting into too much trouble over it - and I got out under an agreement to see a therapist.  

* My mom picked the therapist, and the therapist began telling me that what my mom and her wife were doing was completely normal - which was really fucking confusing for me

* I began taking sleeping pills to sleep through the fighting.  I found the screaming incredibly frightening and stressful - I still do.  I can't listen to people yell without feeling like the world is falling out from underneath me. 

* Eventually, things got physical and I witnessed my mom's partner hit her

In my final year of highschool, my parents moved out of the city and paid for me to stay behind to finish up.  I felt a huge relief and I finally felt like the depression was lifting.  I stopped cutting.  I stopped seeing the therapist that was making me feel guilty for being disappointed with my mom.  Things were good.

But in the poor economy I ended up living with my mom again, now age 22.  It was going okay, despite witnessing some pretty bad fights.  I just tuned them out and left the house.

Then the other day, I found out that some work I'd been doing for my mom was unpaid (I was under the impression it was paid work), and started to panic about money...so I said I felt nauseous and needed to go lay down, but she chased after me, yelling at me for bailing whenever they need me...and I just lost. my. shit.  All those years that things were rough, I just swallowed it and pushed forward...but now, I just can't do it anymore, and I lashed out big time. 

But now I don't know where to go from there.  My family is all breathing down my neck for an apology and to resolve my issues before my brother's wedding so it's not ruined...and I just feel like leaving the country.  I want to be there for my brother, and I don't want to ruin his wedding, but I also just cannot apologize to my mom and her wife.  I feel like it would just crush my soul to apologize to them when I finally stood up for myself.  It certainly wouldn't be genuine.  They think I'm being dramatic and immature, though.  They also deny most of the things that happened when I was younger. 

I'm tired of blaming myself for everything.  I blamed myself for *years* that I had to give up my dog, I felt enormous guilt for cutting, for the suicide attempt, for not having insisted on pressing charges against the rapist (what if he's out there doing it to more girls? what if i could have prevented that?), for everything.  

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted since I finally just allowed myself to be angry at my mother and her partner. I don't want to bring it down again, but everyone's pressuring me to.  Help.

I was seeing him for 2 years and taking meds. Then my family changed their insurance plan and I couldn't afford to go see him anymore. That was a year and a half ago and I've been doing fantastic since then with some minor slip ups.

Story: I'm going to school right now for architecture, which is a 5 yr degree. I just finished my 4th year, but I doubt I'll be able to finish school. I am completely broke, my family cannot help with my finances whatsoever, and I've gotten denied for more loans by 6 different banks. School takes up so much time, there's no way I'd be able to hold a job for more than 15 hrs a week and get all my work done. So I need to come up with about $4,000 in cash by November if I have any hope of registering for Spring and graduating on time. Not to mention rent, food, utilities....

On top of all my financial worries, I've been feeling really down on myself about my progress in school. All my life I was used to thinking I just sucked at everything I did, but then I would do surprisingly well (grades, ACT, work). Now that I'm in college, nothing seems to go right anymore. I'm trying my hardest, and I really love what I'm doing here, but I just can't get the grades I feel I deserve in my design studio class.

What happens when I try to find a job and my potential employers look at me the same way my professors are? I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. To add insult to injury, my current beau gets A's semester after semester in our design class, and I've studied his work through the semester looking for any answers on why he consistently gets better grades than I do just to come up empty handed. I've talked to him about this, but he's terrible at giving advice, and everything he suggested I already do (ex: ""Just be excited about you design! It will show in your work!"" But I LOVE all my projects and I'm always excited about them so that's not really the issue).

Due to a failed relationship, I'm actually terrified of even talking to them for fear of being seen as crazy or desperate.  I never get invited to things anymore either - all of my recent happy memories (last 6 months) involve Ambien, LSD, or pot.

I was doing OK for a bit (a few days) but it came apart when I attempted to get together with an ex, which failed miserably.

I have the constant thought that I'm a bad person, if not in morality, then in quality.  I'm lazy and do nothing, and the things most people think are talents I possess are things I actually haven't done for years - (I'm seen as an excellent programmer, and an award-winning playwright, but I haven't done anything noteworthy in either since my first opus in each category.)

I'm worried that I'll get fired from my job for not doing anything, and then I'll really be sunk.  I'm on prozac, but I'm losing faith in its ability to help - although it might be the only thing holding me together.  It's hard to tell without going off of it.

I've been seeing therapists for years, but besides one particular therapist, it doesn't seem to help.  My psychiatrist I'm actually mildly terrified of, and he seems to be of the ""toughen up"" already attitude.  I'm considering asking to try another antidepressant, but am a bit wary of dealing with him, because I've been so inconsistent with him in describing my problems.  I think he thinks I'm addicted to Ambien (I'm not, I haven't seen it in weeks), and a total wuss.

I used to be really upset about my failed relationship (see my previous posts) but it seems to have spiralled beyond that.  Now I just feel like shit, and only occasionally do I beat myself up for that relationship.  Its like that dragged me down to this level, and now I'm stuck here, regardless of how much I try to deal with it.

I just want to be OK.  Really.  That's all.  Why is that so much to ask?  And I'm so lonely.  I can meet people easily enough if I wanted to - I'm attractive and socially competent enough to not send people screaming - but I'm terrified of the prospect, and honestly too tired to try.",8,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cpr87/i_dont_do_anything_anymore/,1279171093
cpxcd,depression,xstardomx,I think I might be depressed...,"Hi guys. I just stumbled upon this subreddit after taking a look for ones similar. I figure I'll share my story and see where it goes. 

Prior to September of 2009 I was really happy-go-lucky and talkative and confident and ready to go. I was happy. I really was. That month quickly turned into the worst month of my life when a really close friend of mine tragically died in a car accident. We had known each other for 10 years and I'm also really good friends with his brother. Ever since that accident, I haven't been the same. 

For the first month after the accident, I rarely left home. I sat at home thinking about why it happened. The day of the accident I had talked to him at work (we worked together). I had the constant thought that if I just talked to him for 5 more minutes before he left he would still be alive and I would still be happy and doing well. 

Now we're a little over 10 months after the accident. Months 2 to 8 were fine for me. I always remembered him but I was functioning normally. I wasn't happy, but I was doing fine, I was able to be myself without trying to be myself, and I was still making friends and having a good time. 

Then I hit a point where it all came back to me. I started feeling selfish for doing what I was doing while my friend was dead. I felt like I should have been mourning still. This eventually led to a bunch of weird things happening. I was never happy. I had/have to put on an act to be myself in front of people. I don't want to talk to people anymore despite being extroverted for so long. I have to physically and mentally force myself to talk to someone I don't know instead of just walking up without thinking about it like I used to. 

I also started getting much more anxious about things. Weird things. Like I wake up in the morning and go to take a shower and my heart is beating a mile a minute and I'm really nervous about nothing. It happens when I'm driving to hang out with friends, going to work, anything. 

I also get the feeling that my friends don't really like me. This could be just me being a teenager but the feeling is terrible and scary. The last part is just icing on the sadness cake. I leave for college on September 5th. My best friend is leaving for the Army August 9th, everyone else I know is going to different colleges and I'm left to go to mine and fit in like everyone else except I feel like I have a handicap. I'm afraid I won't meet people and more afraid that they won't like me when I try to introduce myself. I don't know what to do. 

I really think I need to get a hobby to start things off. I have nothing to do all the time and this just leads to me lamenting over my problems. ",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cpxcd/i_think_i_might_be_depressed/,1279208956

cq3mm,depression,3525252,Not Really Depression... How to Anxiety About Death?,"EDIT: Wow screwed up the title, How to Handle Anxiety About Death?

I guess this doesn't really fit here because I don't think I really am a depressed person.  Yeah I can often feel sad but it's not like an every day thing normally.  It just seems like the anxiety subreddit is kind of dead, so I thought I would post here.

Whenever I stop to consider death, I have some sort of anxiety attack.  I think about the permanence of death in particular and I start to be overcome with anxiety and start to hyperventilate.  This often happens when I am alone and it is quiet or dark, like before going to sleep.  The only way for me to overcome this at the time is to turn on the light and get up and go do something to distract myself until I fall asleep.

These attacks seem to come in waves, because once I start thinking about it, it is hard not to think about it on a nightly basis.  Eventually, I can go a few weeks or so without thinking about it, but something will trigger it again like reading a dark book and I will be back in the routine.  For example, reading The Road was not a good idea.

I can't bring myself to believe in anything like a heaven, anything beyond the basics of your brain goes dead and thoughts cease to fire.  I wish I did believe something like this sometimes because I'd imagine it would help to believe in something after death, but I just can't convince myself.

I guess I am looking for advice on how to handle this anxiety.  I have read a million little phrases about how to live in the moment, go day to day, this is your only life so just enjoy it, everybody dies so why worry?, etc.

How do other people deal with these thoughts?  Are these anxiety attacks a common thing for people?

Just curious.",12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cq3mm/not_really_depression_how_to_anxiety_about_death/,1279238898
cqcn6,depression,CrabbyCancer,I don't want to kill myself (but I do want to die),"When I close my eyes, I automatically, subconsciously, picture someone putting a gun to the back of my head and pulling the trigger. I imagine a noose wrapped around my neck. I long for the relief, the release. My internal voice is always saying things like ""I wish someone would beat the shit out of me. I wish someone would hurt me."" I am fortunate enough to have a family that cares deeply about me and for that reason I could never take my own life--however I have never felt as though I can tell my family members about the dark thoughts that I've struggled with for years and years. I think they know I am prone to depressive bouts but I don't think they understand the severity of these bouts.

I have a lot of difficulty in forming meaningful relationships.

I had good friends and a good social life my senior year of high school. Late in the year though, my two best friends (male and female) had sex and the dynamic changed immediately--I felt it was me vs. them. I had a lot of trouble with ladies and this felt like a slap to my face (though rationally I know it had nothing to do with me.) I felt I couldn't cope with losing the two closest people to me and I decided to pursue college on the opposite coast, to get away from everything and try and forge my way on my own.

Five years later, I've just graduated college, and I feel completely alone. During my years at college I made a few acquaintances but nothing close to what I would call a ""best friend"". Really, they were people with whom I smoked pot and drank alcohol--when those two activities were omitted, we would sit there in uncomfortable silence.

I had two relationships while at college. The first was someone I met in the dorms--we were great friends for our entire freshman year, until our sophomore year during which things turned physical and soon thereafter romantic. We dated for 18 months before things fell apart and she moved back to her hometown. She was by far the best friend I had made while at college. Once every couple months I'll try sending her an email or giving her a phone call, longing for someone to talk to (I fully accept our time as lovers has passed), but she rarely responds and when she does, it's a very short, curt, unenthusiastic response. Clearly she has no interest in being my friend. 

My second relationship was more recent, during my last year of college. We dated for six months before she told me that she thought we were losing our connection and should break it off (this came as a complete surprise to me). She is attractive and sociable and I'm sure she's had absolutely no problem in finding new people with whom to share her affection. I on the otherhand am shy and very critical of myself and have battled with feelings of abandonment and rejection since she ended our relationship.

I just feel so alone. I don't know why I can't make friends, or why people seem to lose interest and care in me. I want nothing more than a ""crew""--a group of people who value and respect me and frequently include me. I am fit, attractive, and intelligent, but I strongly lack interpersonal skills and strongly resist intimacy with anyone, even though it is what I desire most.

About six months ago I came down with a strange and very painful headache for about four days. I saw a doctor, and ended up being referred to a neurologist and receiving an MRI. I have plaques on my brain that are indicative of the beginning stages of a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. I was supposed to get a second MRI this month to see if things are getting worse, but my first visit to the neurologist wiped out my bank account and I can't afford a second MRI.

I've never seen a therapist or had counseling for any of this. I have never been on antidepressants, but during my time in college I smoked marijuana habitually, often as a form of self-medicating. Drinking I used only as social lubrication, never as medication. I feel like there's a stigma in seeking the help of a mental health professional and it's something I cannot afford on my own--I would need to ask my parents for help.

I'm not sure what my point is in writing this. I just want to tell someone how I feel. I've somehow managed to alienate every friend I've ever had, and as I said I feel completely unable to bring this up to my parents. I seek commiseration and encouragement, advice and suggestions.

cqip5,depression,throwaway42dgsg,No one explains the crushing aloneness of life quite like Kahlil Gibran,"THE LAST WATCH  
  
At high tide of night, when the first breath of dawn came upon the wind, the forerunner, he who calls himself echo to a voice yet unheard, left his bed-chamber and ascended to the roof of his house. Long he stood and looked down upon the slumbering city. Then he raised his head, and even as if the sleepless spirits of all those asleep had gathered around him, he opened his lips and spoke, and he said:  
""My friends and neighbors and you who daily pass my gate, I would speak to you in your sleep, and in the valley of your dreams I would walk naked and unrestrained; for heedless are your waking hours and deaf are your sound-burdened ears.
""Long did I love you and overmuch.  
""I love the one among you as though he were all, and all as if you were one. And in the spring of my heart I sang in your gardens, and in the summer of my heart I watched at your threshing-floors.  
""Yea, I loved you all, the giant and the pygmy, the leper and the anointed, and him who gropes in the dark even as him who dances his days upon the mountains.  
""You, the strong, have I loved, though the marks of your iron hoofs are yet upon my flesh; and you the weak, though you have drained my faith and wasted my patience.  
""You the rich have I loved, while bitter was your honey to my mouth; and you the poor, though you knew my empty-handed shame.  
""You the poet with the bowed lute and blind fingers, you have I loved in self-indulgence; and you the scholar ever gathering rotted shrouds in potters' fields.  
""You the priest I have loved, who sit in the silences of yesterday questioning the fate of my tomorrow; and you the worshippers of gods the images of your own desires.  
""You the thirsting woman whose cup is ever full, I have loved in understanding; and you the woman of restless nights, you too I have loved in pity.  
""You the talkative have I loved, saying, 'Life hath much to say'; and you the dumb have I loved, whispering to myself, 'Says he not in silence that which I fain would hear in words?""
""And you the judge and the critic, I have loved also; yet when you have seen me crucified, you said, 'He bleeds rhythmically, and the pattern his blood makes upon his white skin is beautiful to behold.'  
""Yea, I have loved you all, the young and the old, the trembling reed and the oak.
""But, alas, it was the over-abundance of my heart that turned you from me. You would drink love from a cup, but not from a surging river. You would hear love's faint murmur, but when love shouts you would muffle your ears.  
""And because I have loved you all you have said, 'Too soft and yielding is his heart, and too undiscerning is his path. It is the love of a needy one, who picks crumbs even as he sits at kingly feasts. And it is the love of a weakling, for the strong loves only the strong.""  
""And because I have loved you overmuch you have said, 'It is but the love of a blind man who knows not the beauty of one nor the ugliness of another. And it is the love of the tasteless who drinks vinegar even as wine. And it is the love of the impertinent and the overweening, for what stranger could be our mother and father and sister and brother?'  
""This you have said, and more. For often in the market-place you pointed your fingers at me and said mockingly, 'There goes the ageless one, the man without seasons, who at the noon hour plays games with our children and at eventide sits with our elders and assumes wisdom and understanding.'  
""And I said, 'I will love them more. Aye, even more. I will hide my love with seeming to hate, and disguise my tenderness as bitterness. I will wear an iron mask, and only when armed and mailed shall I seek them.'  
""Then I laid a heavy hand upon your bruises, and like a tempest in the night I thundered in your ears.  
""From the housetop I proclaimed you hypocrites, Pharisees, tricksters, false and empty earth-bubbles.  
""The short-sighted among you I cursed for blind bats, and those too near the earth I likened to soulless moles.  
""The eloquent I pronounced fork-tongued, the silent, stone-lipped, and the simple and artless I called the dead never weary of death.  
""The seekers after world knowledge I condemned as offenders of the holy spirit and those who would naught but the spirit I branded as hunters of shadows who cast their nets in flat waters and catch but their own images.  
""Thus with my lips have I denounced you, while my heart, bleeding within me, called you tender names.  
""It was love lashed by its own self that spoke. It was pride half slain that fluttered in the dust. It was my hunger for your love that raged from the housetop, while my own love, kneeling in silence, prayed your forgiveness.  
""But behold a miracle!  
""It was my disguise that opened your eyes, and my seeming to hate that woke your hearts.
""And now you love me. 
""You love the swords that stroke you and the arrows that crave your breast. For it comforts you to be wounded and only when you drink of your own blood can you be intoxicated.  
""Like moths that seek destruction in the flame you gather daily in my garden; and with faces uplifted and eyes enchanted you watch me tear the fabric of your days. And in whispers you say the one to the other, 'He sees with the light of God. He speaks like the prophets of old. He unveils our souls and unlocks our hearts, and like the eagle that knows the way of foxes he knows our ways.'  
""Aye, in truth, I know your ways, but only as an eagle knows the ways of his fledglings. And I fain would disclose my secret. Yet in my need for your nearness I feign remoteness, and in fear of the ebb tide of your love I guard the floodgates of my love.""  
After saying these things the forerunner covered his face with his hands and wept bitterly. For he knew in his heart that love humiliated in its nakedness is greater than love that seeks triumph in disguise; and he was ashamed.  
But suddenly he raised his head, and like one waking from sleep he outstretched his arms and said, ""Night is over, and we children of night must die when dawn comes leaping upon the hills; and out of our ashes a mightier love shall rise. And it shall laugh in the sun, and it shall be deathless.""

cr3pv,depression,throwaway__alt,I'm in a weird place right now...,"Background: I've dealt with depression on and off for about six years (I'm a 23 y/o male).  I never concerned myself with it or told anyone about because it felt like something I needed to deal with myself (can't really explain the logic behind that choice, but it felt like I'd be admitting weakness or something).  Then about two years ago I had three panic attacks in one day (Thursday). Over the next two days they gradually got worse (went to the ER, but since it was the weekend, they pretty much sent me home saying if I were to be admitted to the mental health clinic it would have to wait until Monday).  By Sunday it had progressed to a paranoia; I believed that I was either dreaming/not real/etc.  When I was taken back to the ER on Monday, I was fully delusional and experiencing what I can only describe as schizophrenia.  I had totally retreated within my mind experiencing non-stop daydream-like delusions and hallucinations.  I was admitted for a week, and treated for the next year and a half, the effects disappearing, ultimately being diagnosed with bipolar NOS.

Now: I've since gotten a new job, new friends, watched my niece grow up (now just over a year) and found someone who has been through similar but very different experiences in her life.  The latter has shown me (who's always had a bad self image) that it's possible to find someone who can like me for who I am.

Problem: I'm really happy...and that's why I'm more depressed now than ever.  It seems too perfect.  I can't describe to anyone the way my perception of reality changed from before the panic attacks started to now.  One of the delusions that dominated my thinking when I was hospitalized was that I was some sort of computer-like object running a simulation. Certain events trigger that line of thinking for just a split second, but it's enough to give me pause.  I usually experience a feeling a deja vu along with it, sometimes three or four times a week.  

It doesn't really effect my day to day life, but it does effect my ability to enjoy what should be the best time in my life.

I guess I don't really know if I'm asking for advice, or just venting, but I would like to hear some thoughts.",10,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cr3pv/im_in_a_weird_place_right_now/,1279518995
cr9w7,depression,throw8888,discouraged,"I've been struggling with depression on and off since 1994, when I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  Since then, I've done a lot of work on myself... I became a Buddhist and did tons of therapy, was part of some self help groups for a while.

I haven't dated in a long time.  I've been a bit gunshy since the last gf a few years ago and only the crazy drama queens seem to be attracted to me.  I had a comfortable job that slowly went to boring, then mind numbing.

I went back to school and was super stressed, but it was a field I'm really interested in and enjoy doing.  In the process of going back to school, I moved across the country.  In school, I didn't have many friends.  I'm a 39yo male, and most of the students were women and much younger than me... a totally different place in their lives.

Since moving, I haven't been able to make good friends, no matter how I try.  I just keep winding up with acquaintances... no one who wants to hang out more than once every six weeks or so.  I've done the whole meetup.com thing and some other stuff too... nothing goes anywhere.

I had two job offers right out of school, but the first was doing unethical stuff that they could get shut down for... I quit, and the second was overworking me and co-workers were treating me like crap so I quit that one too.  I've been pessimistic about job stuff since.  It's also a stressful field I'm going into, so I don't know which jobs I find that I can currently ""handle"" in the state I've been in.

In the last year since that job, I've been suicidally depressed/anxious twice. They've discovered that my thyroid is dead and slowly gotten me to the right level of synthroid.  They've tried a bunch of different anti-depressants on me.  The first one was part of me quitting the job.  I was feeling anxious, and the pills sent my anxiety through the roof where I couldn't calm myself or sleep.  I found a decent therapist in the city, but I've been in and out of therapy so long that I'm not too optimisitic that it will fix anything... more that it will just barely keep me going.

I'm kind of tired of hiding this from new folks I meet, but you also can't make friends by talking about how much you are tired and depressed all the time.  People are attracted to happy people.  Hell, I'm often afraid that I'll lose the friends I already have... that they'll get tired of me bitching and moaning all the time over the phone.

I don't really enjoy anything right now.  I just go through the motions.

I'm visiting friends back in my old home now, but fly back to the city tomorrow, and kind of dreading it.  I just wish I was someone else.  I just wish I didn't have these problems.  I wish I wasn't so broken.

* Male.
* I’m either gay or bi... still don’t know.
* I’m an Atheist.
* I’m a liberal and definitely support the idea of anarchism.

I’m not dying of a disease. I have all my limbs. By most counts, I’m quite lucky. I’m not a homeless child suffering through hunger on a daily basis on the streets of some third-world city. I’m supposedly LUCKY...

But, I am so unhappy, on a constant basis.

I watch sad films and listen to sad music in order to make me cry... just so I can feel one ounce of emotion... the kind of emotion that every mechanism in modern society is engineered to suppress.

I’m a coward too. I’ve had almost no confrontations in my life but whenever I face a problem I choose to avoid it, simply by ignoring it and pretending, at least for a few moments of solace, that it doesn’t exist.

I don’t even want to be able to function in this kind of society. I really hate the world. I used to have so much faith in humanity – I genuinely thought people were born good-hearted... But now, with each day, I hate the world more and more and the people in it... I love and hate people at the same time. The state of things just makes me so sad.

I’ve cried more in the last month than in my whole life prior to that (except, perhaps when I was a baby...). I want to CRY. It makes me feel real – it makes my problems seem real – it gives me the confirmation that I’m allowed to feel shitty about things. I can’t explain it very well – it’s hard. I hope you understand.

crt5t,depression,OAThrowaway,Zoloft. Yay or nay? Medication woes.,"I talked to a doctor today. I told her that I had anxiety that kept me from functioning, and that I was unable to concentrate on important tasks.

She recommended Zoloft and I told her that no, that doesn't sound like something I want at all.

If I fill the prescription, I will probably take 3 every other day to make my mood as erratic and painful as possible. That's what I've done with other medications.

But I had overreacted, according to the professionals, and they explained that my torture was unneccessary and how it was very easy to live with this illness. But how was I to manage anything in the little time between the frequent attacks. So I explained, time after time, that it may seem like an overreaction but to me it was very real. I suppose a number of phobias came into play as well.

But they would not hear it, I must've had some underlying issues they thought, this had just triggered it all. I assured them there was not, lying a little each time.

Until in exasperation, I confessed. When boys had begun peering into girls' locker-rooms, I stayed put. I was quite more interested in the people in my own locker-room. Wonderful, they thought, science had prevailed again and they could finally start working on curing my depression.

But being homosexual had never been a problem to me before that. I had developed normally, reached puberty and simply bended the other way. I knew the truth, I never made a choice, who would make the conscious choice of being hated, disregarded and discriminated upon? And I know the truths of my own life, no amount of bigotry can change the truth. I never planned to let my family know until I was far, far away and completely self-supporting. I had it all figured out, it was not a worry.

To them however, it was. And they began on helping me with the non-issue, ignoring my original plea for help. I kept trying to reason with anyone who would listen, but my reasoning was apparently faulty. Soon after, my sexuality came to my family's attention, I had been too desperate to make professionals understand me that I had not thought of that inevitable storm. My family was poor, highly religious and traditional, my mother was a housewife with three children, my two already adult sisters were housewives with their own children, carrying on family traditions approved by mother and father. I was already a black sheep in the family, I had no interest in religion, no interest in settling down and providing my parents with grandchildren (I was evidently sexually unable to).

The first time they heard the answered with howls of disapproval. How could I be queer, of course I had to be queer, I had been an abomination since very little, always disappointing them. They settled down eventually though, and after a few private meetings with a counsellor welcomed me back into the family. The welcome was short-lived however, they had not accepted me as much as they decided that they should keep a very close eye on me and keep me from committing abominable sexual acts. I despise the people who made me come out, I despise myself for confessing, why hadn't I been stronger. I was quite happy with keeping this part of me hidden for a large number of years to come.

But I had already lost hope, lost hope in getting help, lost hope in ever being free from depression. Nobody listened when I told them about the real reason I got into this mess. So I faked myself to freedom, pretending to feel better because my family now knew and had accepted me. I decided to dive back into the short and expensive comforts of various drugs and alcohol, this was the hand I was dealt and I should embrace it. I was very aware of the consequences that
could arise, but why should I care anymore? When people around me were too conceited to listen, they knew what the real problem was, they knew my mind better than myself. 

A few years have passed since then, my circumstances have not changed significantly. In addition to my past troubles I am now paying the price of years of drug-addiction and enormous debts, I have nothing but shame to my name. I have tried to get help several times, 
but everytime that help gravitates towards less pressing issues, so I quit trying. 

Ironically, I have come to terms with my illness, but my depression has not gone away, I was in it too deep. I am resigned to the fate I have inflicted upon myself.

I never allowed myself too much self-pity, I knew where my life would be headed and I did not do anything to stop it. I did allow myself hatred, in excess. I hate the people who plunged me into this dark pit. Perhaps too much hatred.

It is, however, in a fleeting moment of self-pity I write this. I am desperate for someone to hear my tale.

I stopped taking my meds for a few weeks ago with no withdrawal symptoms, but unfortunately after some real bullshit occurring involving my dumb bitch failure of a landlord I now need to find a new place to live.  I find it increasingly hard to control my emotions- sometimes Ill feel normal, but one small trigger (money, landlord issues, any slight annoyance) and my emotional response turns straight to rage.  I never used to be an angry person, but I find life seems to drag me kicking and screaming towards this, and theres nothing I can do to stop it.  I dont like this, and I fear I may lose what I cherish most if I dont find a way to control it.  Welbutrin helped but it made me sick all the time, and Im starting to think Id rather be sick and in pain than be angry, depressed, and hateful towards the things I cannot control in life.  Im starting to get thoughts of hurting myself, and obviously I dont want to do that- this will make things worse; yet there they are in the back of my mind.

ct8nj,depression,somethingrandom101,I feel my life goals are unobtainable and therefore have 0 motivation to do anything.,"I'm not sure how to write something like this, hopefully it'll make enough sense for someone to read it and help me out.

Basically, it's what the title says. I'm currently doing Computer Science @ uni, with the main aim of programming video games. Sadly though; it's incredibly hard to get anywhere near the industry and for the most part, I just feel it's incredibly unique (especially with the millions of other people who want to do something similar, majority of which who are probably better/smarter than I) and therefore I feel it's totally unobtainable to the point where I don't even try to get anywhere. I've tried to get myself to do self-projects and demos which will help me when I graduate (hell, even bought a $1500 macbook which I'm still paying off because I thought I could make some iphone applications and take my career in that direction) but I have no motivation because of the fact that I'll never eventuate to anything like that and I just get the overwhelming feeling that I shouldn't even bother because it won't get me anywhere. All I've done (in terms of programming) outside of uni work are basic tutorials.

That's not the only thing; I've been recently I've been interested in doing a bit of DJing (as I've liked trance music forever) but considering there are probably thousands of people who are in the same position trying to get somewhere with it, I just find that, again, it's so unique. The fact that there aren't exactly many good DJs compared to the thousands who want to get there depresses me because I find it so unobtainable to the extent where I don't even want to practice. I've considered sharing what I have recorded to people but I'm just too ashamed to share it considering my skill level and the skill level of many others, it seems to be a bit of a realitycheck that I'll never be that good (I haven't even told that many people because I'm that ashamed). It just saddens me because I feel like I'm wasting my time and that I should be doing something else and trying to get somewhere like my friends/family.

So, basically, I just feel like shit all the time now. I do things that need to be done, but when I get some time to myself or anything of the sort, I find myself being incredibly bored and don't even bother trying to better myself in anything because the skill required in either programming or djing is so high to be picked over the thousands of people wanting to be there. I'm 20, and not sure what I want to do in Life, and the fact that I'm 2/3 done in a degree scares me because I'm not sure if I want to be a programmer. I really, really don't want to find out that Computer Science/programming isn't my thing and I don't want to waste peoples time/money in making this realisation; but I seriously get bummed out at the thought of this kind of thing.

It's like how everyone says that everyone is always good at that one thing; I just don't know what my 'thing' is, and I'm really bummed out about that because I'm starting to think it's a bit of a lie. People say you're meant to work for the things you love and that it shouldn't feel like work but I can't find any real motivation to do anything because I just feel I'll never get there. I can seriously see myself, after graduation, just sitting around home doing nothing. I want to change this, but I just can't get over this whole attitude.

I'm hoping someone can shed some light for me, as I'm not really sure how to progress from here. Luckily uni starts again on Monday so I'll be able to focus on that and not have to think about this kind of thing for the next few months.

*edit: thanks guys; for some reason I can only see 3 (out of 5) comments, but I'm amazed at the number of upvotes and comments, I seriously didn't think that many people would be interested in helping me out. I'm focusing on my studies at the moment and just trying to change my attitude as well as reading histories of the top people in programming/djing and trying to drum into my head the fact that everyone started from nothing. Thanks again :)*",7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ct8nj/i_feel_my_life_goals_are_unobtainable_and/,1279983945
ctycb,depression,Indyhouse,Job interview today. All the guy wanted to talk about was my psoriasis. So depressed. I've lost count of the interviews; I'm so sick of this. ,"I've posted in SW a couple times about my depression and psoriasis, loss of job, difficulty finding a new one... I had an interview today for a job that I am perfectly qualified for. On the phone, I was told I was the most qualified applicant they've talked to.

So of course, two days before my interview, my psoriasis flares up. Eyebrows, forehead, fucking hands, ears...... everywhere visible. Creamed them up so they were just red and slightly inflamed (as opposed to dry, white, crusty and bleeding), but two minutes into interview it all started to go downhill when he asked me why my skin was red on my forehead. 

I kept trying to bring the interview back to what we should have been talking about -- my SKILLS and EXPERIENCE -- but, no... interview lasted just 10 minutes and he wouldn't even shake my hand at the end of it. I can't do this much longer...

EDIT: On top of this, we got a letter last week from the state saying my wife and I had been declined Medicaid because she makes $22 PER MONTH over the limit. My medications are $1,600 per month. We called the hotline and they said we should be able to find coverage for an individual for $22 a month. I almost fell out of my chair I was laughing so hard. The cheapest plan I can get is through the new government ""pre-existing condition"" plan since no insurer will touch me. The cost for me under the new ""affordable"" government plan is $400 a month.

ctydi,depression,selfh8r,Just another one,"First tried to kill myself at age 9. Gun jammed. 

Tried to kill myself most of my teenage years with drug use. Didn't work.

Got married at 23, it was okay for a while. My kids kept me sane although my wife/now ex-wife is a very violent and tormenting person. I divorced her 5 years ago. Since I have only been allowed to see my kids twice. Her family is rich (how she has custody) so even though they routinely violate the custody order, I can't afford a lawyer to hold them accountable.

I pay 1200/a month in child support for two kids I never get to see or talk to. They are being taught to hate me and they are told openly that I am a dead beat dad who abondoned them and doesn't care about them. I have heard my ex and her mother say these things to my kids over the phone in the background. I don't even want to know what they are teaching them when I can't hear.

I just can't keep my thoughts from trying to kill me. I can't stand a future where my kids hate me.

I just lost my apartment due to roommates fucking me over, now going to be renting a room in my friends basement. Just feel like a total piece of shit and it's beyond any kind of ""I wish I was dead"" scenario.

cu0yb,depression,ilessthanthreemath,A warning about using Lamictal/Lamotrigine,"Just wanted to throw this out there, writing this based off of personal experience.

As those who take it may well know, Lamictal (generic Lamotrigine) carries a black box warning about Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (severe, possibly fatal skin rashes). Obviously, one should consult their doctor immediately when symptoms start to appear.

One less severe (and less spoken of) side effect, however, is short-term memory loss. Most people seem to learn to deal with it. In my case, however, it's only gotten worse as the months have gone by. In the first few months, I would have minor problems remembering minor things like the location of my keys or wallet. Later, I started to develop concentration problems where my mind would wander and I couldn't focus properly. I would also occasionally go to bed and wake up to see that I had sent out emails or gone on a farming run in Guild Wars. Since I always have my smartphone with me, I tried to ""deal with it"" like my doctor suggested and tried writing down everything important (since Lamictal works fairly well for treating my problems and there's nothing else really like it).

Now, recently, it's gotten to the point where my short-term and long-term memory have both pretty much been fried. I experience massive gaps in my day in addition to the sporadic forgetfulness. I was at home the other day and couldn't remember anything that had happened that morning. Not waking up, not driving to campus for summer classes, not taking notes (which I obviously had, there was insane, almost illegible scribbling in my notebook), not the drive back.

I also can't recall certain things from the past year, things that I shouldn't forget. Names of people, places, things I've done. I *know* that I took a course during the first summer semester a few weeks ago but I can't recall anything about that entire month and a half. I don't know what I did in the course (I passed it, but the notes are entirely nonsensical). I don't know what I did in my free time while out of class. It's a complete blank. I have a new set of semi-expensive headphones but have no recollection of *when* I bought them without looking at the invoice (about three months ago). Trying to think hard about things that happened a while ago usually ends up with a minor headache and no concrete answers.

**tl;dr: If you have memory problems with Lamictal, don't screw around, don't try to ""deal with it"" like I tried to do. Talk to your doctor and jump ship before you can't manage it anymore.**

I'm not saying that Lamictal is a bad drug - without it, I don't know what kind of shape I would be in today. Either more miserable with my memory intact, or dead in a gutter, I don't know.

Right now, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Stepping down the dosage didn't make it less noticible before (and I can't go off it), so my doctor is making me try a third option: supplementing the current cocktail of stuff with something to try to boost focus and concentration. I don't have high hopes that this is going to work at all.",14,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cu0yb/a_warning_about_using_lamictallamotrigine/,1280192571

cu2q7,depression,Zotmaster,"""It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself.""","I've hated myself for as long as I can remember.  When I was little, I told myself that it would get better, but days turned into weeks, and weeks into years.  I'll be 26 next month and I feel like the same lonely, lost kid I was when I was ten.

I haven't had a great life.  There are a lot of things on which I can lay blame.  I got bullied and harassed in school almost every day from fourth grade until the day I graduated high school.  It's funny: the only time I ever got a break from it was around seventh grade when I joined up with my bullies for a short period of time.  After seeing the reaction of our mutual target, I felt absolutely disgusted with myself.  Having abandoned the mutual goal, I became the victim again.  People wonder why I don't believe in things like karma, heaven, or hell: even throwing aside the fact that there's no scientific evidence to support any of it, it rains on the just and the unjust alike.  The unjust don't get any more rain and the just don't get any less.  My family really was no help, either.  There was a lot of screaming between my parents when I was little...they divorced when I was eight.  My mom used to tell me that the reason I got bullied in school was my own fault...because I annoyed the kids.  It shut me up.  She would never admit it to this day.  My older sister bullies me too.  Before, I was too little to defend myself, and of course when I got older, fighting back wasn't allowed either.  No one can push my buttons quite like she can.  Pathetically enough, we both live with our mom.  She did manage to leave to go to college for a while...I never made it out.

I've never been that good at making friends, either.  My best friend from when I first learned to talk decided I wasn't cool enough for him once we hit around middle school age.  My best friend at this point in my life is actually someone I've never met.  That's right: it's someone online.  I didn't aim for it to go this way, but I've never really had people who were willing to even pretend like they gave a fuck: she did, and she was the only one who did.  Nonetheless, she's a story in and of itself.

It's easy to give practical advice.  ""Don't let it get to you!"" ""Forget everyone else, do what makes sense to you!"" But it does get to me.  And I don't know what makes sense to me.  I work in a shitty retail job.  I don't even really feel like there's much of anything else I can do except get more shitty retail jobs.  I've never even had anything that really stood out as something I really wanted to do with my life.  There's just...nothing.

People tell me I'm a nice guy.  I honestly want to believe I'm a good person at heart.  I care.  I'm one of those people who says something or buys someone something just because.  People tend to like me from afar, though.  On the rare occasion that I muster up the courage to even ask if a person wants to hang out, I usually get no answer at all, or else I just get the runaround.  There's only so many times that can happen to you before you start to realize that people don't want to hang out with you.  Whatever it is, that mutual whatever that turns strangers to acquaintances, and acquaintances to friends, I just don't seem to have it.  Women drive me fucking nuts.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard the ""There are no nice guys"" thing.  Then I hear I'm a nice guy.  But apparently I'm not nice enough.  Or good enough.  Or whatever.  My dating history literally brings people to tears.

But nonetheless, I feel like the buck stops with me.  I don't like laying blame on others.  I often overcompensate for others anyway.  I know that in this world, there are an untold number of people who have it worse than I do.  Hell, I have a genius-level IQ.  And I wish I didn't.  It marks me as different.  And I don't think people like different.

About a year ago, my best friend - remember her? - convinced me to finally seek counseling.  I have, and now I'm also being prescribed Wellbutrin and Celexa.  Some days, I feel like I'm in a better place, even if it's not much of a better place.  On days like today, though, I can't help but think I've gone nowhere at all.  And there have been a lot of days like today lately.

I guess I'm writing this for a lot of reasons.  Maybe part of me feels that if I get mocked badly enough, it'll make me finally stand up for myself.  Part of me is just tired of lying to myself.  Part of me wants to believe that others care and can help me get through this, and maybe I can help them in return.  And part of me doesn't even know why I'm writing this.  It's ironic, really: I don't even really like talking about my life, and yet here I am...",4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cu2q7/its_so_lonely_when_you_dont_even_know_yourself/,1280203116

My girlfriend and I were in a long-distance relationship for almost two years. The plan was for me to move to be with her after I graduated college, which I just did. The problem has always been that she lives in another country. With or without her, I want to move there, but now it feels even more difficult. 


We fought a lot, mostly due to my mood swings (I'm bipolar), and I was never really able to get a grasp on how to control them (I am on medication) as much as I tried. I've always been overemotional, moody and irrational, I guess, and I feel like it's ultimately what ruined the relationship. I don't take all the blame, but most of it is mine. It got to the point where she would tell [small] lies because she was afraid of what my reaction would be. I was/am also jealous of her friends and her outgoing life because I feel like I don't have any friends, and I just sit around all day being bored and depressed. This, of course, didn't help matters. We only broke up on Monday, and it was extremely sudden. That morning/afternoon, she was calling immigration, and I was looking for jobs in her country, and that evening we were done. I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to deal with this because she does still love me and vice versa.


On top of that, I'm doing the whole job search thing, which is just ultimately depressing. I don't know where to look for jobs. I'm completely unhappy where I live, but I don't think I'll be able to find anything internationally, and I feel like no one would want to hire someone who isn't a citizen anyway. I know that I should take whatever job I can find (as everyone seems to say), but I know I would just be unhappy, and I don't think I can deal with that. I basically just cry the whole time that I look for jobs here. Technically, I've just cried all day since Monday.


Because I'm graduating, I also will no longer have insurance, and I'm not sure what to do about that. I've gotten worse, and I told my girlfriend that I would do my best to get better, but now it just feels hopeless. I need to talk to someone, and I need to keep taking my medication.


I'm also still holding out hope that she'll decide she wants to be with me still, but I doubt it's going to happen. I think I'm just too much for her to take, which just continues my cycle of losing friends because I lose control of my life once it gets to around the 2 year point. Right now I am just giving her space.


I've also been looking into going to a school internationally, but I've realized that I actually can't get into any school because my GPA is too low, which reinforces my believe that I'm just completely stupid.


I really just don't know what to do. I feel completely lost, and more and more I'm getting to the point where I don't want to be here anymore. I just don't know how to deal with everything.

cvq3k,depression,HurrDurrMurr,Need help,"Hi reddit, I'm hoping I'm posting this in the right place, I did not want to come into attention as I would in askreddit as I feel this is not anomynized enough.

I need some help to come out of my depression that I have had for almost a year now, and I need some advice on what to do. I live in Sweden, and I'm currently 19 years old, my depression never really started from a specific event, it has sneaked upon me, so I’ll start 2 years ago.

Spring 2009: I was in the last year of the gymnasium (might translate to high school), in school I was always talking and doing stuff with 2 other friends, but we never really did anything after school. This was a nice period of my life, I had some problems, but none major, and I had fun.

Autumn 2009: I had joined an university 40km away from where I live (at my mom or dad), so I rode the bus there only when I had lectures. By doing this I never really talked to anyone in the school, and thus made no new friends, and I never talked any more to my old friends from the gymnasium.

Winter 2009: I got even more ill than I usually are (I have always been ill in some way, I’m always tired, always hard to breathe, I often have headaches), just mustering up the willpower to go to school was a hard feat, as I coughed my way there. I also began to have short time memory loss, I just could not remember some things. I was often afraid, and uneasy (like if you have been awake for 2 days, and swaying left and right worrying about something). I went to the doctor, took some tests, he sent me to the psychiatrist.

Spring 2010: Some random psychiatrists (or whatever they were) did some autism tests and other tests, all came out negative, but they make an appointment to some dude in September, that I was supposed to talk with (Swedish health-care is free, but long queues).

Because I suck at writing (I just barely did not fail Swedish and English classes in the gymnasium (because of terrible teachers, most of the class barely passed, and our class nearly had everyone with the highest grade in the other classes)), and reddit, tv being my only real english teacher for the last 4 years I will write the rest of this post as a list, with information in no particular order.

* I seem to only make friends in school, I lost my best friend just changing to the gymnasium when I was 15, we just never really talked anymore when we could not talk in school.
* I am a really nice guy, I quickly makes friends, and people like to talk to me, but I never seem to be able to keep any friends.
* I sit at the computer all day long (not fat, but bmi 24, so close) just watching youtube, browsing reddit, playing wow (not much anymore, our guild can’t kill any virtual dragons, and we seem to be taking a hiatus until the next expansion)
* I sometimes have a goal at moving to Gothenburg (big city in Sweden), try to find a web developer job, but I never do it, as I’m afraid. I’m afraid of not finding a job, I’m afraid of not finding any friends, I’m afraid of being alone (atleast now I have the company of my mom and dad), I’m afraid my knowledge is not enough.
* I sometimes want to get a dog, a reason for me to go outside, but I’m afraid of that too. I’m afraid I can’t spend any time with my mother (she is allergic to cats), I’m afraid I won’t be able to take care of the dog, I’m afraid of the dog barking (father lives in apartment), I’m afraid if I choose a old-ish (a year old or something) dog, he will never bond with me, I’m afraid if I choose a puppy he will shit on the floor, he will keep me awake all night.
* I maybe got a friend, I talk with him nearly every day, but we never talk about anything more than “o look at this picture I found on reddit.com”, I have tried to talk more about him, more about me, but he seems to just shrug it off. I have tried calling him, I offered to come to Gothenburg (160km), and maybe we could go the amusement park there, but he declined. I’m currently making a really shitty site with him.
* I don’t do drugs, alcohol or anything.


Ask me if you did not understand anything, and if I ommitted something. I don’t really have any questions, but I know I can’t just live all my life browsing reddit and watching videos.

TLDR: If you only read this tldr, I don’t like you, and please just close this page.

cvunh,depression,[deleted],I don't even know why I'm posting this..,"Hey people of reddit. I'll make this as short as possible. 
I've been depressed since about 14 years old. I was always a small kid, still small now. Deformed (concave sternum) tons of childhood shit to only reinforce my thoughts. Every relationship I ever had was somehow pushed away by me and my stupid ways. I'm always thinking the worst because it's all I know. I'm in fear of losing my job every day. I'm 30 and have no career, no home, just a studio apartment in NYC. I sleep where I eat basically. Everything I strive for, somehow, gets ruined. Like I have the Midas Touch....but instead of gold...it's shit.

Since I was the age where I felt depressed, I've had that butterfly, nervous, anxious feeling in my stomach. Rapid heart beats. 25/7. I have it right now. I wake up with it and go to sleep with it. It's like a way of life now. Recently I lost a very important person in my life.
The only person I ever felt completely connected to. More than any friend, family member or girlfriend I knew and had. She's also someone I love. I pushed her away as well. Yeah I know..""wah wah wah get over it"". Believe me I know. It's just such a blow to me because...man I don't know. She wasn't a band aide. Just for once..someone finally understood me and let me be myself. Also..it's like another addition to the shit pile I have for a life. Another fuck up I caused to invade my mind.

Yknow what..this is useless. I don't even know why I'm typing this.
This is fucking pathetic.

I also feel like I have no right to bitch about anything because there's people that have it far worse.

cw309,depression,azarf,"Reddit, I'm Worried My Mother is Suffering From Severe Depression and I Need Help","Uh... Someone from /r/advice said that my post would be better received here, so here goes...

About three days ago, my mom completely lost her shit in the middle of the motorway. She started screaming and punching the windows; it almost seemed like she was having some kind of seizure, except that she was coherent enough to make sentences.

So we pulled over, and she was screaming at me to get out. I tried to leave the car, but then she told me not to move. She started with insults and the like, and that didn't really bother me, but then she began grabbing at her door's handle and screaming about how she wanted to die and didn't know why she was alive anymore.

Ummmmm... Some context, here: My dad has been emotionally and physically abusive for as long as I can remember. It's gotten so bad that I recently left home over it. She appears to be completely in denial, but I always get this niggling feeling that she's staying in denial purely because she doesn't want to have to come to terms with the fact that what's happening is really wrong.

Anyway, it was a really terrifying experience. My two younger sisters were also in the car at the time, so I'm very worried about how they're coping with it...

I just really don't know what to do. My dad won't let her seek any help or support. I feel as if there's nothing I can do.

(More context: I am an eighteen year old girl in Australia. Also, because I think it might be more relevant on /r/depression, I'm also suffering from severe major depression. I've been on Zoloft for almost a year, now, after a visit to the mental health ward. I'm not coping with this very well at all.)

Does anyone have any advice for me? I'd really appreciate anything, at this stage.",12,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cw309/reddit_im_worried_my_mother_is_suffering_from/,1280665759

cw84s,depression,not_a_believer,I wanna share a secret; its a certain cause of the suck-fest that my life has been till now. I want to change it! ,"I am somewhat of a bipolar nature, and right now I am in actually a manic mode. But never in my manic modes have I ever written something like this. 

I was in a all-boys military school as a kid, and I was sexually used, or molested, by a guy 4 years older than me. Twice. When I was 11. When I didn't even know about what sex was ( I was kinda late on it I guess). There was no penetration, but it was sexual all right. 

That was bad, but more came later. Because this incident happened in a dorm, where the perpetrator or the loser was something like a dorm captain, this fact was an open secret. 

Long story short, I thought of myself as dirty because of what he had done. And kinda blamed myself, never in thought, cause thinking about it was out of bounds for me, not only because I didn't know shit about it. 

I cannot tell you how dirty I have felt because of it. There is no comparison, because it just does :') 

So yeah, I kept to myself in school after that. The other kids knew, some tried to help actually, by talking to me about it, but that was too less, sad to say. What was not less was how some others tried to use that fact against me; as a shaming device. Funny thing is it has not really happened that many times, but since I was automatically ashamed of myself, I was, _after that_, always the quiet kid. Not because I was naturally so inclined, I was actually a hyper kid, someone with ADHD and always running around; but after that I became quiet. 
   
So yeah the shame of it. Fuck the shame. Sometimes it seems so fucking irrational, but other times its crippling. Lets see what else I got, later:

* being a coward: specially in social situation. I cannot talk back to anyone, even if insulted etc. Ask me if you wanna know how, as with anything else. 

* being paranoid: that surfaced because of a social situation in college where I **felt** persecuted. I became deeply suspicious of any group of people ( since shame was  accenuated if it is two people who are discussing what a ____ I was; I still have had some amount of personal dignity I suppose to not feel shame in one way interactions. Funny how it works).

    So I was so paranoid, that if I was in a public place, and saw two people looking at me and talking, i will think they were trying to insult me. Its really hard to write in a few words. But lets just say it was sick. 

* Being laid back: lets just say I am a loser. With no job, no one to talk to, but 10000 Karma here because I spend 10 hours a day here! 

    I am just lazy, I refuse to do anything, because I suppose I have long-term depression now. Plus I still got some self-esteem issues. I need to improve that. 

Sometimes in moments like these, like the one I am in right now, moments of clarity, it seems so foolish - my real personality. Shamed of what happened to a 11 year old! Fuck that, its irrational, but its still with me :'(

Yeah I am getting teary eyed writing this, because I see a life wasted. 19 fucking years! 

-----------------------

yeah the purpose of this post is actually to show the world, in my anonymous manner, that there is nothing shameful about what happened to me then, and that I am not gonna remained ashamed of that, which is true enough, and to affirm that if anyone mention what a pussy( translated term)  I am I am gonna punch him in the face.

-----------------------

But let me also take this opportunity to ask for advice, specially how do you think my reaction should be to what happened. Just tell me what is it that you think about it, cause I need a dose of rationality here; having a picture drawn out by my 11 year old mind is not the best picture of reality :)

cwbqf,depression,silentandlooking,"Do I feel this way for a reason, or simply due to a chemical imbalance.","Obvious throwaway.

I'm 27, male. Never sexually abused. Lower middle class, strict southern baptist family, though I have claimed atheism since 17. Just recently enrolled in a community college.

I can somewhat recall my emotional state changing at age 21.  I feel like something clicked, although it's really hard to remember exactly what it felt like.

I pretty much only realize it when I look at old pictures.  I remember being very carefree, very popular, and loved to laugh, have fun and meet new people.

But around 21, I think my personality changed.  I was in a serious relationship at the time of 4 years.  I remember this was the first time I started yelling at a girlfriend whenever we would get in small arguments.  It turned into me throwing things and punching walls.  This behavior has continued in my romantic relationships.

I also have become very judgemental. I look at people and think terrible things about them.  I think I secretly am jealous of them, that I think they are ""cooler"" than me, so I pretend I hate them.

I feel lethargic.  I have no energy to do anything. I have not been able to gain weight or muscle mass. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 140lbs.

My relationships have all followed the same path. 

- me and the girl meets

- I charm her and she falls for me

- the relationship moves fast

- we have large amounts of sex, pressured by me. if I dont get sex I get angry and pouty.

- I resent all her male friends and when she talks about them, I get very jealous

- I begin to not enjoy her going out with any friends and get very uncomfortable when shes somewhere without me.

- I begin to say awful things when we argue and threaten to break up with her. I'm wanting her to fight for me to stay with her, even though I realize she SHOULD be leaving ME.

- A few months later, she leaves. the break up is messy and we end up not speaking again.

I've had this exact scenario play out for every single one of my serious girlfriends (over 6 months).  I am not on speaking terms with any of them. They would all describe me as depressed, needing therapy, with serious trust issues.

I tell people that they cheated on me, and though some may have gotten close, I have no proof than any did.  Each of them went on to have serious relationships afterwards they are still in.  My most previous is getting married, less than a year after we broke up.

There are reasons I think I act like this

- I havent accomplished anything important in life so when I see my gf talk to another guy, I assume they are automatically cooler than me and that it is obvious she would leave me for them.

- I feel smarter and more artistic than most people, and though I lack the motivation to act on these artistic impulses, I feel that my genius is not acknowledged ( but why would it? i dont do anything).

I dont think I'm going to list more as that may be redundant.. I'll answer questions if they come.

Point is, ive never been in therapy. I give the reason that ""I dont believe that shit works"" and a part of me believes it.  A part of me believes that I'm as intelligent as they are when it comes to figuring out my problems, but the truth is I'm kinda just embarassed.

I have been to a dr who prescribed me klonopins and some kind of anti depressant, though I cant remember what it was.  I didn't take them because he prescribed me them after a 15 minute talk and I thought was kinda bogus.

My gf went out of town with her girl friend for the week on vacation.  The night before she left I got drunk and we had it out. This is one of the first real fights we've had together. Usually, I'm not drunk when I treat a girl like this.  The only difference was I passed out before I broke anything. 

Now shes gone and though I've apologized and she accepts and understands that ""I was just drunk sweety"", I have slipped into a deep depression without her being around.

Because she hasnt been able to call much, I have pretty much stayed in bed feeling terrible.  My stomach has butterflys, my head and joints ache.  I feel tired but cant sleep. I called into work today.

I went to a bar and a stranger gave me 5 1mg xanax's after shooting the shit with him smoking.  This was the first night she left.  I dosed the second night one pill.  It knocked me out within 30 minutes and I slept til the next day. I cant tell if it helped my mood.

Do you all think I sound like I am just whiny and need to get over it? Or perhaps I have the symptoms of what may be a chemical imbalance and need medication.  Please help. I'm sick of being me.  Im tired of hurting people.  I want to love.

cwfek,depression,EnvyEye,Maybe I just need to type it out. What do I do?,"I feel like my life is falling apart. My car needed new brakes so my dad insisted I drive 2 1/2 hours so he could do it himself. He let me borrow his truck but it's been 4 months and he hasn't fixed my car. He truck leaks and the one time I forget to fill the oil before leaving for that long drive I break down. He's pretty sure that I ruined the entire engine. So I'm just going to have him keep my stupid little car as payment.

I can't seem to focus on anything. I don't know what to do with my life and I'm not happy. I'm trying to work but Subway has me working long hours for very little pay. I need a second job but I don't want to have to drop out of college to do it and pay for everything.

My brother is a cadet at the Air Force Academy. My parents seem to like him so much more. My dad actually told me on my senior trip back in high school that I was a shitty son and that he had failed as a father. I don't even remember what it was that I had done to make him so mad. And now his truck is ruined and he blames me. I would have rather taken my car to someone and paid out my ass to fix it. 

I just am always upset and nothing really seems to be going right for me. I can't handle it and I'm not sure what to do. The university has 10 free sessions with a therapist and maybe I'll try and go to that. I might type more on this later just because it's nice to talk even if many people don't comment.

cwozq,depression,viciouscycles,Is this depression? Or is it just me unable to cope?,"Throw away account here. I'm a 26 year old female. I feel like my life is a roller coaster. I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when I was 12. I would say it was a year or so later when I started to feel really depressed. After moving out of state when I was 9, I didn't make any good friends until I was in high school, so I was pretty lonely most of the time. I was diagnosed with Poly-cystic Ovarian Syndrome when I was in the hospital with a kidney infection when I was 18. This past January I was told I have an under active thyroid and put on Levothyroxin. Back in April I was told I had very low Vitamin D levels and have been taking supplements since. I have also battled with being over weight most of my life.

I finally got a therapist around 14 or 15 years old. I knew I was depressed and had suicidal thoughts. I put a knife to my wrist a couple times, but never did much damage. I had tried to tell my mom that I was depressed and needed help but she just said ""It's normal for teenagers to feel this way because of hormones."" She finally agreed to let me see a therapist when I told her I had ""tried"" to kill myself. x_x I went to therapy, was taking Zoloft &amp; Welbutrin, and began to improve. My psychiatrist tried to put me on Topamax at one point as well, but I had a bad reaction to it. Eventually I came off Welbutrin and then Zoloft too. I felt better.

Fast forward a couple years, I felt the depression coming back. I went back to the same therapist, but it wasn't working. I felt worse going there than I did without it. So I stopped going and somehow I managed to pull myself through it and I started to feel better again.

Fast forward to 2006 and that's when I moved out of my parent's. I was ecstatic to be out (I have a much better relationship with them now compared to when I lived with them), but I did have a some really awful experiences with the first 2 roommates that caused me a lot of anxiety and financial stress. My friends either moved away or were off at college. I started to feel lonely and depressed; but this bout was different. I was experiencing drastic mood swings. One day I was very depressed, and another I was full of energy and really happy. I ended up seeing the same therapist again and a new psychiatrist. The therapist didn't help me much (she kept trying to pressure me to join her yoga class, which I have no interest in). The psychiatrist thought I had Bipolar Disorder though and I was put on Prozac and Lamictal. Eventually I felt better and things were looking good. I even met my boyfriend in March 2007. Eventually I stopped taking the meds (mostly to cut back on expenses, cus I was barely making it). My financial state has always caused me a lot of anxiety, especially when the medical expenses just pile up.

Fast forward to summer 2009. Huge change at my job. A lot of lay offs of course, but my old position (which I was perfectly content with and enjoyed) disappeared and I was put in a new position that caused me great anxiety. I felt inexperienced (there was only one competent person, and the entire office needed him to help) and I was more in the ""spot light"" than I was in the previous position. I started having nightmares and a lot of anxiety. Eventually it got so bad that I just stayed home from work for a week because I couldn't motivate myself to go in. Well, skipping the details, I ended up quitting. I saw my primary doctor and got a Rx for Prozac for the anxiety.

I managed to find a new job at the end of August. I finished the one month supply of Prozac and felt like I didn't need it anymore. My new job started out great, but eventually the same thing happened; huge changes and stress. The turn over rate was pretty high and the one manager that was great ended up quitting. The new manager was incompetent and had a pretty awful management style (ugh micromanaging). This was around the same time I was dealing with extreme exhaustion and told I had low Vitamin D. The stress and anxiety built up, I end up in the E.R. one day, and I feel like I can't deal with the job. I asked if I could work part time or from home (they did not have issues with my performance and loved me there), but HR said no. So I gave them my two week's notice and I quit.

I have been unemployed since June 5th and I've applied to so many jobs I am qualified for, but have not even gotten an interview. My depression is getting worse and I feel like I just keep entering these cycles. I can go for a year or more and feel fine for the most part, but then I still get this cycle of awful depression eventually. I think I get a handle on things, but then I fall apart again eventually. I know I need to go back to therapy, but I have no income now so I can't afford it. I'm scared about going back on meds because I'm afraid long term use will cause me to gain weight and it's so hard as it is for me not to gain weight due to my other medical problems. I am scared of losing everything, including what I value the most, my independence. The last thing I want is to have to ask my parents for money and/or to move back to their house. I am crying every day because of how miserable I feel. My boyfriend tells me I'll feel better once I get a job, but I don't know if that's true. And who is to say that job won't be stressful? I may just fall apart again.

My father has always told me I am too sensitive and I need to ""get a thicker skin"". My sister told me I ""can't handle life"". I've never had any ambitions or goals or a lot of interests. I went to college but just got an Associates in Liberal Arts because I never found anything I wanted to major in or make into a career. I am so depressed, lonely, and tired. When I am not job hunting, I am in bed trying to sleep so I don't have to be conscious to deal with my sadness and anxiety. I know it will pass eventually, it always went away before...but then I also know it always comes back....so will I ever actually beat this? Or am I really stuck with these cycles for life? I know there are people out there who go through way worse things in life and can deal with them and be happy, but it doesn't seem to be that way for me. So then I feel awful because I can't cope...and I know my family looks down on me for it. It hurt so much when my sister told me I can't handle life. I always looked up to her growing up, and when she said that, it was like a big slap in the face and made me realize how she really views me. She doesn't believe in depression at all and thinks I use it just as an excuse and that I am a ""spoiled brat"".

I really wish I had more friends irl. I have plenty online or people I know irl that live out of state, but my ""local"" friends are few and they never call me or ask me to hang out (yet they'll talk to me online no problem) and if I initiate plans with them, they'll suddenly bail or not show up without even telling me. It feels pointless to try to hang out with them if they're that flaky. I have my boyfriend right now, but then I feel like I am ""depending"" on him to make me happy and that scares me because I know that's not right. I should be able to happy on my own and I don't want to depend on him to feel some sort of happiness. But on top of it all, I've been having bad dreams (daydreams too) about losing him, usually him dying or leaving me.

I'm really hitting rock bottom here and I don't know what to do because I have no income and can't afford the therapy or meds I probably need. I'm also angry as hell that I may need to rely on the meds to function like a ""normal"" person.

cwteq,depression,throwawayish,Might be depressed and / or burnt-out - what do I say at work?,"Hi Reddit,

I hope this is the right place to ask this question.

Been struggling with some issues for quite long time (which are topic for a separate post). I finally decided to look for help - I spoken to my doctor last week. He thinks it might be depression and / or
burn-out and suggested to talk to counselor which I'm going to do some time next week (hopefully).

Also, he suggested to take some time off work and said he can write me sign off but I refused as my employer is rather accommodating when it comes to taking time off.

But my question is - how do I bring it up at work? On one hand, like said, my employer is quite accommodating but I'm still afraid they will drop me like a hot potato when I mention burn-out or depression (especially since recently I've been completely unproductive). Also, there's (maybe only in mind) some special stigma regarding depression so I'm not quite sure I feel comfortable enough to mention that I might be suffering from it.

I would be interested to hear what was your experience like? How did you deal with it; what was the reaction?

cxa95,depression,imreallysomeoneelse,I'm on a boat!,"Actually, picture a coffin in the middle of the sea. Got all these questions. Don't know who I could even ask.

(free karma if you know &amp; like the song I'm quoting)

So, this isn't meant to be an exercise in self-loathing... rather, I hope that by throwing this out in to the void of the interwebs, I'll get some things off my chest &amp; perhaps find catharsis... maybe even some good advice to boot.

I have anxiety - specifically, panic attacks. Came out of the blue about 10 years ago. Various things trigger them, but they generally manifested themselves as a fear of driving on the interstate &amp; flying. Two things which are basic requirements for my job. I think I could have been a surgeon &amp; developed a fear of surgery... or a coal miner &amp; developed a fear of mines. I don't think I'm really afraid of driving or flying, but rather it's a convenient outlet given the frequency that I experience both things.

I lived with the anxiety for about 6 years &amp; just tried to deal with it. Eventually, I reached a point where I was finding it hard to function day to day. That was when I decided to go see a doc &amp; get meds. Took 120mg of Cymbalta &amp; 1mg of Xanax daily for 3 years. Panic attacks went away &amp; I was so very happy for a couple of years.

Fast forward to last summer. I start hating how I feel - no emotion at all... never happy, never sad... Sub-human - an empty shell. For one reason or another, I decided to go off the meds - so I quit one day &amp; never took them again.

Things were fine for a few months &amp; I had high hopes that the panic attacks wouldn't return. I'd lived without them for a few years, after all - had conditioned myself to do the things I had been afraid to do. Nonetheless, they did eventually return - and with a vengeance.

Fast forward to the present. Few months ago I decided to start seeing a counselor instead of going back to a pdoc &amp; getting meds. I must admit that it's been helpful. She's given me techniques that help deal with the anxiety. I still have panic attacks, but I at least feel like I have a few tools under my belt to deal with them.

She tells me last week that she feels I'm depressed. She wants me to go see a doc &amp; get meds to help get through the depression &amp; be in a place to better deal with my anxiety. I understand her reasoning, and tend to agree with her on some level... however, I'm very hesitant to go back on meds, even for a short period of time, given my previous experience.

I do think I'm depressed. I live every day in a state of dread. I dread going to work. I dread going to sleep. I dread taking a shit. I dread this, I dread that. I'm not happy at all.

My marriage is a sham, or so I feel... and that's one of the major things we've touched on in counseling. She says that I will never get better until I resolve my marital issues. Either fix the marriage, or leave.

For one reason or another, I just can't seem to do it. I absolutely loath my wife... but we have a house &amp; I like having a house. I feel safe there in my little space. I garden. I have a few hobbies that I work on there. The few things I do enjoy are at home... I would have to give them up to leave my marriage. Fortunately, we have no children.

I hate my job with a passion. I actually own my own business, and that's not the attitude a business owner should have! I used to do cool things! I was rolling out DSLAM's 12 years ago... I used to do netsec audits for banks... I used to build SANs &amp; all kinds of cool stuff that I enjoy. These days it seems like I only clean up viruses. I fucking hate viruses &amp; if I have to do it one more time, I'm going to go fucking nuts.

I hate society in general. I'm not anti-social - I really do enjoy the company of people that I like. Seems like there are few of them, though. I just hate the confines that society places on us. We grow up, go to college, bust our asses to make something of ourselves. Why? I think most people, myself included, did it / do it because they hope to be a provider for their family. I'm 36 &amp; it's obvious that I'll never have kids at this point. That breaks my heart &amp; really makes me angry.

So, that's some of my back story.

My dream - honestly, the only dream I seem to have these days - is to pack up &amp; live the life of a van dweller. Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about.

Pack up, hit the road with my camera &amp; just live. Say the hell with life as I've been trained to live it. Sacrifice, struggle, figure out where I'm going from day to day &amp; just fucking live. No rat race... no bullshit. Just life. Be a nomad.

Thing is, though - I'm not sure if this is a realistic thought. I mean, I dream about this! I actually have dreams about what my life would be like on the road. I've always enjoyed road trips / wanderlust... I think I'd be happy. However, 36 years of life has taught me that you're supposed to have a steady job &amp; income. You're supposed to have all of these things that we all have. If you don't you're abnormal.

Furthermore, I don't know if this is just my depression talking. If I weren't depressed, would I still feel the same?

I don't know what to do, so I do nothing.

I turned it down, because the instructions say to avoid alcohol, but I'm wondering if this is a hard rule I should never break, or if it's okay to have one standard drink with food.

cxwdn,depression,buttbeard,I don't know what to do.,"I'm struggling again.  I get sad out of nowhere and the weight of it just crushes me.  All I can think in my head is how badly I wish I could just disappear to somewhere where money or jobs or relationship conflicts don't exist...but such a place really doesn't exist, so, then I think I'd just rather be dead.  I mean, I would never kill myself, but dragging my ass through life is just so fucking exhausting.

I've been in and out of therapy for years and years, but now I can't afford it.  I don't want to go on anti-depressants, either, which I know a lot of you will think is part of my problem...but the number of people I know who went on anti-depressants and got even worse is too intimidating.  I don't know anyone who did well on them. Plus, I'm afraid of losing my sense of self and even if I wasn't, I can't afford the meds, either. 

My boyfriend tries his best to be supportive but honestly, sometimes he contributes to my stress.  Not anything out of the ordinary or whatever, just having conflicts with him (even minor ones) will make things really difficult for me. 

Sometimes I just feel like checking myself into a hospital, but I don't think they take people who aren't risks to themselves, and it would really fuck up my life (I'd lose my job and wouldn't have my dog around, who's one of the greatest sources of stability for me).

cy9x1,depression,EnvyEye,Helping a friend out is turning into the biggest mistake I've ever made.,"I let a friend live with me. Her mom kicked her out. I already live with two complete slobs so I pretty much stay in my room all day. But now I'm living in one room with another person and I think it's making me go insane. Maybe I just wanted to vent this, but I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice.

Either I'm completely insane or I'm the worst person in the world. She makes me feel like shit on a day to day basis. We dated for a while and then we broke up because I couldn't deal with it, but as it turns out breaking up with her just means dealing with all the same shit except now I don't get laid.

Every moment she wants to know what we are doing, or where we can spend money, or what I can buy her. It's CONSTANT. She's begs for a puppy so much that I want to kill every puppy in the world just so she will shut the fuck up.

She blames everything on me. If I seem a little irritated or upset she starts screaming about how ""YOU RUIN EVERYTHING! WE WERE HAVING FUN."" If she would give me 5 seconds to calm down or just realize that I'm not a fucking life cheerleader all the time I wouldn't get so upset. It's not other things that make me upset, it's her. Every time I'm not the happiest fucking camper in the world she acts like I've done something wrong. Her favorite thing is to tell me that I'm acting like a ""dick."" 

And she bitches about everything. All day long. She'll go ""UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" LONG and LOUD just because it's a little hot outside. Then she spends 100$ on books. Then she complains about her mom. Then about how she has no money. Then about how she has no furniture for her apartment in Sept (THANK GOD we'll be apart soon). It's just a constant memememememememememe. (Me, not meme lol). I feel like this post proves that I'm going insane. 

There is so much that I'm having trouble writing it out. Either, basically, I'm the WORST fucking person in the world, or she is manipulating the shit out of me. And now all her coworkers think poor little girl needs rescued from the Big Bad EnvyEye. Maybe she'll start fucking her manager so he can take her off my hands since ""he had a non-romantic attraction to her from the moment we met because we've both had similar problems in life."" What a fucking pervert. 

Help? Ask questions? Get me to talk through this? Anything you can offer will be appreciated. I might edit more just to add shit.

Edit: The advice IS helpful. It's like I know what to do but I want to ask for help anyway. I guess I'll try to upvote everyone who comments, even if it's a stupid thanks.

Edit: And if she comes back from work and wants to change? Work things out? Do I say piss on it? Or give her a shot? 

Edit: Now that I'm asking her to leave she's telling me that she had decided she loves me and wanted me back, but now I ruined it. Why does this feeling eerily predictable?",16,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cy9x1/helping_a_friend_out_is_turning_into_the_biggest/,1281128789
cydxu,depression,helpme_please,I can't stop self harming. Can someone help me find another way? [Cross-post from/r/suicidewatch],"I have anxiety and depression - a lifetime of abuse from childhood. Time passes, I'm in my late twenties and married. I'm a strong blue personality, and my wife is red-blue. When we have disagreements, she can make quick judgements that are only right part of the time. When this happens, I feel betrayed and alone and I 'crash'.


I go into a sort of a trance/detached state. I feel as if my head is going to explode. I can't work, I can't do anything productive - I feel like if my brain is a computer, it really did crash. She and I are able to talk about it and work it out after I come out of it. We're working on my/our issues - and I've gotten better over the years. But for this, I need to get out of it first.


In order for me to get out of it, to get back to clear rational thought and to feel emotionally clear again - only two things have worked. Orgasm through masturbation and self harm. The nature of the self-harm is usually punching myself in the head and the face, or hitting my head on something really hard. I do it in such a way that my wife doesn't know and there would be no visible signs. I have a theory that it might be the endorphins resultant from those actions - though I could be wrong.


Ideally, I would like to do neither. I've been getting better at both recently and I don't want to lapse into both. Recently, I've been doing more of the head punching. It used to not hurt very much but now it really hurts every time. I've given myself about 4-5 concussions over the last three years. I worry about incurring brain damage but I don't know what it would take to do so.


Is there a third option that I can go to that people know or have worked for others? Any ideas what I can do?

cynpa,depression,cabbagehaus,Think I'm becoming depressed for the first time in my life..,"As the title says, I believe I'm becoming depressed. Yes I am a male (21) who is hiding behind a throwaway account and yes this is all over a girl.

I've done a fair bit of reading on r/depression, r/relationships, r/relationship_advice and other places on the net trying to get some help with this but I can't get over where I am at.

Long story short, finally met a girl after being single my whole life and rejected when I tried anything. So of course I get heavily invested (I always commit fully to anything and everything I do). Everything goes well, we get on like a house on fire, spent heaps of great time together on so on. 3 weeks in, that's it. Get a couple of texts at work, see her that night and we are done. She feels she is getting depressed over her ex (they broke up 4/5 months previous) and can't do a relationship. That's completely understandable. I took it hard because it started so well, she was completely happy. I've asked her since if she was hiding it the whole time but she says she was not and it all happened in her mind that day. This all went down about 4 weeks ago now.

Anyway, I struggled enough with that. Always thinking about her, wanting to get back with her etc. Sadly enough there was a few nights I cried myself to sleep. When I did manage sleep it was broken and never lasted. I've gone off my food and have dropped from an already low 125lbs to 112lbs. We agreed to stay friends, mostly because we want each other in our lives. We haven't seen each other in person but we have communicated via text and online. I agreed to be there for her and support her with her depression because I didn't want her to be alone.

I was slowly getting my head around all of this. Last week on Sunday, I woke up feeling good for the first time since. I had a clear head, all was well. I was back at work Monday after a week off and felt really good, like I was coming out of the pain and finally moving on. I had got into a semi regular sleep pattern again, I was eating better and exercising again. We had been talking and she sounded great. A lot more happy, almost back to the same girl I initially got to know. 

Fast forward to the end of the week. I find out yesterday morning, from her herself, not indirectly so it got skewed or anything, she had a big night Friday. Fair enough, she has to get on with her life too, to get over her ex and this depression etc I get that. But she goes on to tell me that she got black out drunk and ended up waking up in naked in some random guy's dormroom unable to remember much what happened the night before.

Just like that I've gone backwards and feel 100x times worse than I have at all through this. Before you say she can do that if she wants, I realise that, we are not together and she owes me nothing. I just feel so shit because only a month ago, we are having this massive talk about how she wants to be single and she doesn't want anything at all even remotely close to relationship and doesn't want to be thinking about guys etc.

All I've been able to do all weekend since is mope around the house and admittedly I've ended up in bed crying feeling absolutely pathetic. Thinking about this as I've typed it, I know I'm being a bit over dramatic but i'm just stuck in a rut. At a spare moment I end up thinking about her and getting myself down again and I don't want this anymore!! What hurts even more is she isn't the person I got to know and care for. She was very moderate in her drinking and not the least bit promiscuous and now within no time at all, she is the complete opposite. 

What can I do r/depression? I just want to be happy again. I've thought of seeking out help through my doctor or even just finding a counselor to talk to but I'm getting to the point where I want to apply for my career. A career which requires strict medical clearance and anything remotely considered depression means no no, you can't do this. Ever. 

TL;DR: Got dumped by my 'first love' who didn't want a relationship due to her own depression. She moves on after a month and starts drinking heavily/sleeping around. I feel like shit. :-(

Edit: What annoys me most about this is how it just hits me at random. As I typed this out and felt good for getting it off my chest.

I haven't made any friends in the two years I've been there and my old friends from school don't talk to me any more. They've got new ones now who are much more confident than me  and even when one of my parents almost died they didn't bother coming to see me.

It is mind consuming as this is the priority of my life. Not school, not work, but to feel companionship. I do not have highs anymore and I believe I have minimized the lows with vitamins. It is like being a zombie, without emotion.

This may sound ridiculous and it hurts me to even admit it and many may say just grow up already, but If there was even a small dosage of female interaction, and not just the ones who give me my change when I order a coffee or breakfast, then I do not feel like I would be in this position right now and feeling like this. This is not about sex if that is what you automatically assume. This is about being recognized as a person. I do not want the attention that a 20 or 25 year old woman gets, but the fact that as a man in this society who is completely ignored, it just destroys me and leaves me non functional. I can not have a clear day while I am living this life. If I was acknowledged as a person and not a human traffic cone to be avoided, I believe it would give me the confidence to come back into society. To come out of my shell and start living again.

Yes, I know it all depends on me and if I change my attitude I can lead the life I want. But I feel like a car which has run out of gas and nobody is willing to give me an ounce of fuel to help me out to get to the gas station to refill. I need a little fuel because I can not do this alone right now. And I don't think drugs will help me since drugs can't change loneliness. So is it such a horrible thing to ask for me not to be ignored. Why? That's what I want to know, why would you ignore me. You yourselves are not ignored and are in fact showered with attention. That must be such a confidence boost that I can not begin to imagine.
It tears me up inside to think of a woman who goes through her teens and her twenties and has so much going for her and so many people who want to be with her and here I am, alone for so many fucking years and nobody wants to give me a single hello. It's a horrible cycle, the less I get, the more I withdraw into my shell which results in even less human contact. 

And its such a shame, I had such big dreams for myself. Ive always wanted to work with renewable energy but that dream can't happen if I'm stuck in this daze. I need the reason to wake up every single morning to get my day started. And I've waken up alone for so many years and have woken up for myself only but myself doesn't cut it. I need the reason to make this existence worth while, and I've been denied. It hurts. It hurts a lot.

My family has a big vacation coming up and I don't want to ruin it for them. But I really have nothing to live for. Things just keep getting worse and worse. This part will just be a long rant about everything that happened because I am a story teller by nature 

I supposed it all started getting to it's lowest in December. I have tried finding a job since then to no avail. I got kicked out of college because the job I had was taking all my time and I couldn't do my home work, then they fired me. I've been without work since December. In Feburary I was hungry and I tried to steal some corned beef hash (high calories, heavy food) from Wal-Mart. I got caught of course and they said ""well you'll be sent a bill for it."" I apologized profusely and went home without my food. A few weeks later I get a letter from Michael Ira Ansen's law office saying I owe 200 or there will be charges pressed. I tried to explain I had no money, so they told me I could pay 35 a month. I wasn't able to make if for June, I got that paid end of July. Now I am late on July and they are saying they will press charges. I still owe 95. 35 a month for me is food and hot water. I moved a few months ago (april) with a room mate and his girlfriend who bailed on me last second. I am stuck with a 800/month house payment and can't find another room mate. My family is helping me now but I can't take that any longer. I really can't. My parents are old and sick (My dad had a major heart attack in April) and I should be taking care of them. It's well past that time. I can't get back into college and I missed my chance for unemployment I believe, because I didn't think I'd worked long enough to qualify. I can't get on any support.

I signed up for college again, got accepted, but they need my application fee before the 26th or they will cancel me. I won't have it. I just won't. 

I want to call Ansen and explain my situation but my phone doesn't work and I can't really talk well on the phone anyways. 

Anyways. A few months ago I decided to plan this out carefully. I just want to be done. I need to make sure as much as possible is in order before then. 

I can't start giving things away, that is obvious. But I need some solid plan to make the transition from life with me to life without me as simple as possible. As simple and clean as possible. I am of a highly rational mind and I can only believe that if I am unable to find any work, or even find a sign that I have been considered for work, I must have no skills to offer. I am a waste of flesh. I am completely and utterly useless. I figure the only one who won't understand is my cat. I don't know how to tell my parents I don't want them to have him. They don't know how to take care of pets and he isn't even a year old. He might, unfortunately, outlive them.

I am also worried about my characters. I know it sounds odd but I made up these characters over the course of years while trying to fall asleep and I don't want them to die as well. They are innocent in all this. They are just normal book characters. No kind of crazy thing. Just book characters I really like that I happened to make up.

On top of all that, I have really bad social anxiety so going to tons of places to look for jobs has been really wearing on me

Rant over. Anyways. What would make it easiest for those around me after I die? Is there any ways for me to take out a loan to pay for my funeral? I don't want my parents to have to pay for that. I have no insurance. Not even health. I haven't seen a doctor in six years and I am sure I am becoming quite sick.

cz6ab,depression,TheChimera,I could use some advice.,"Hello all. I have been struggling with getting my life together lately and could use some advice. I suppose a bit of background is in order:
I am a 34 year old male. I have been suffering from depression for a very long time now (most of my life) and have started being treated for it about 3 years ago and I take Pexeva (form of Paxil). 

I also suffer from agoraphobia. Being in new places, meeting new people, and doing new things are hard for me. The medication has made it somewhat easier to deal with but I still have times where I will try any way that I can to get out of doing things that are making me scared. I get nervous about certain upcoming events and obsess on them weeks before they are scheduled to take place. Since starting the meds, there are certain things I *can* do again and enjoy like going to the movies, out to dinner, or the park that I would try to avoid before. Other things like certain get-togethers I will agonize and get physically sick anticipating.

My depression is better but there is something that concerns me. I feel like my moods are a little unstable. I feel like I go from happy to sad too often over the course of the day and the severity of it is starting to worry me. I am starting to get concerned because I can be calm, relaxed and in good cheer one minute and the next I am daydreaming about killing myself or feeling completely hopeless. Sometimes there are things that trigger this is me and sometimes it just kind of happens for no reason. Today I had an odd point where I felt anxiety, sadness, and I guess you could call it happy anticipation all at once. I can get very flustered and angry (although I keep it inside most times) at the smallest annoyance. 

My medication was reduced about 4 months ago. Could this have something to do with what is going on with me? 

Sorry if this post makes no sense. I'm a bit freaked out today and trying to get my head on straight. Thanks..",7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cz6ab/i_could_use_some_advice/,1281380220

czp0c,depression,tboxer,Help with my situation?,"I have been out of a past relationship for over a year.  Upon entering a new relationship recently, my ex girlfriend has come back into the picture.  The ex was someone I spent numerous years with and would of done anything to be back together with her. 

As our friendship began to begin again, things progressed and I found myself getting very deeply invested.  It finally came to the point, where I told her I had feelings still and wanted to be back together. 

She ultimately made it clear that she was only looking for a friendship. After almost waiting a year just to have her as a friend, she was gone again from my life.

I find myself in a complete state of emotional distress. To the point where for the past few days I can't even get out of bed.  It is consuming me and I can't stop thinking about her. 

After talking to my therapist (who is unfortunately out of town).  He made it clear that I closely tied my well-being and happiness directly to this person, and by losing her in my life again,  i was in a sense under attack. 

I was hoping to get advice on how I can help myself in the short term?  Is this a case where I even want to try and have a friendship or are my emotions playing tricks on me?

d0cmh,depression,IloveYouToInsanity,"My girlfriend has borderline, I knew that, what I didn't knew was that it would affect me this badly.","Dear Depression Reddit,
I'm a 25 year old male. 4 months ago I fell in love with a college girlfriend of mine that I knew that was diagnosed with a cluster B (borderline/narcissist) personality disorder. I know this, I know she's in therapy for it, I know/experienced borderline patients that are pretty obviously messed up, she hides is very very well, I've never expected it to go from lovy-dovey love you crazy to ""Welcome to Silent Hill"". We literally grew towards each other in the course of over a year. All went well, we had a great time, I was caring, she was loving me back. I've never been happier in my life other then the occasional heartache I felt when things are going iffy. 
Then, out of unholy nowhere she started to ignore me and since we never fought over anything I suggested she either learned how to argue over stuff rather then ignoring me since ignoring me without me knowing what I did to her seriously pisses me off. 
She responded in a fashion that really scared the crap out of me. Never had she lied to me, never had she tried to hurt me. She tried to make me feel like an immature idiot by suggesting that she wasn't ignoring me, and I had it all wrong. And for that she was going to ignore me a bit more. 
I was like -- okay she's trying to see if I'd crack... right... So I asked her out on another date, she tells me to leave her alone. That ""other"" people would have gotten the fact that if they are ignored they would leave her alone for the time being. Then she calls me on the phone telling me she does not want to go on a date with me, because she can't (this will be lost in translation: Dutch, ""rekening houden met"", lit. translation is ""take into account"") calculate me into her life at this moment. I asked her if there was a real reason behind this because it doesn't sound like a suck reason to stop dating (I know her quite well, she has no external stress other then college, nutso dad). And if this was worth losing me because I was pretty fed up with her not acknowledging me as her boyfriend even though we made love (I love making her orgasm until she just crawls on top of me giggling like a little girl), loved each other pretty obviously also according to the rest of group of friends we share that she's comfortable with. I tell her that she either needs to communicate or learn how to argue over stuff because ignoring people is ""not done"" because it's a form of abuse. (at least it is in my culture)
Anyway, 3 days later we had a trip planned with mutual friends, she acts like nothing ever happened. I kind of try to ignore her without bursting into tears. And she tries to fuck my brains in. 
I was like W.T.F., first I almost go crazy because you feel the need to string me along forever and you're basically telling me you don't want me in your life as your boyfriend. We kind of break up, or set rules. And now this. 
At that point her best friend starts to make excuses for her behaviour and that she understands my points of concern and that they are very legitimate.

Now, as for my question, I want to know EVERYTHING there is to know about this condition. Please someone point me in the direction of some scientific literature, required reads, whatever. I love this girl to death. I've been in relationships before and I'm not going to quit on her until she actually says it's over. 
Currently I'm into sessions with a psychiatrist (had a monster 3 hours with one yesterday and 2 hours this morning) in order to deal with this. All we've talked about is how she behaves and he has given me great suggestions and showed me the logic behind her ""madness"" if I shall call it right now. The most helpful insight I've had until now was the everlasting theme of her needing to be in control at all times. 
I figured out why she pushed the first time; it was because I wanted her to meet my parents (I visited hers). 
I've talked to her about this is very much confirmed. Her entire body go's into ""DO NOT WANT"" mode for suggesting this. 

tl;dr This story paints a far from complete picture of what we did, this girl is quirky, has a nasty sense of humour and I love her to insanity. Please help me with some insights, literature, humour to help me carry this relation into a manageable vehicle while there is still mutual trust and love.

Advice please?,"We've been friends for a few years, he's confessed to me I am one of the very few who knows pretty much everything about him.

I've experienced his up and down moods, it's not very nice but I am a tolerant friend. :) 

When he's depressive he's indifferent to everyone, including me, yet I don't ignore him, I know he appreciates me being there for him even though it's often a one-way-communication (just leaving a text message to him is often enough, he's told me later when he's out of the depressive swing that he appreciates it). 
I was wondering if there's something more I can do for him when he's feeling down? I've lurked around but I can only seem to find advice for people with manic depression themselves, but nothing of what us, friends and family, can do to support him?

d0jua,depression,notgeorgeclooney,I need advice...,"So here is my situation.  I did poorly my first two semester at college and lost my scholarship due to depression/SAD.  I was too depressed about my lack of friends and the ease everyone else was making friends to do my work well.  I ended with a 2.1 my first semester and a 1.something my second.  I was put on Zoloft this summer.  I feel....different.  I don't really feel sad but I don't really feel motivated anymore either.

My parents are afraid that if they send me back I might relapse and do poorly and they really can't afford that financially.  I understand their fear.  But I also am afraid that if I don't go back and I am stuck at home, I will go crazy.  As paradoxical as it sounds, even though I get so much anxiety from some social situations, I still want to try them out and be there.

So here are my options.

1)  Go back and try to retake some courses that I failed that would really boost my GPA and carry on my college career.  Also I would be at college and I think when I am my best self I can make friends and do well socially.  Its just I haven't been able to be carefree enough to be him.

2.)  Stay at home and try to take some of the courses online.  I would stay at my home in Jersey (I go to college in Maryland) and try to take the courses online.  I am not sure how valid of an option this is though, I am still looking if my college will allow this.

3.)  Take a semester off and maybe take courses at my community college/get a job.

Oh to further confuse matters, I had won free housing in a nice apartment for my sophmore year and I don't want that to go to waste.  I don't know if it can be put off I will have to look into it.

I am worried about falling behind my peers.  I don't know why I care so much about that but I do.

What do you think I should do?

Also, I think adderrall would really help me.  Since taking this zoloft I can't seem to concentrate or get motivated.  Does anyone else do this/think it would be a good idea?  And anyone else get the lack of pleasure from orgasm?  I am almost 4 weeks in and this just started.  It stinks.

d176z,depression,[deleted],Do anyone else have unrealistic thoughts of their loved ones dying?,"Hey guys,

I have been feeling really weird lately and I don't know how to deal with it. I have suffered from severe anxiety and very mild depression my whole life (I have been on Zoloft and I am currently on Celexa.) I feel like it helps my anxiety attacks a lot, but lately I have been having them again. When I have them I feel like I am going to die. I have a new symptom now that I haven't felt since I was a kid (I am a 21 year old female.) I have this irrational fear that everyone close to me is going to die/get hurt. It's becoming debilitating. For example, my mom lives across town and was going to come visit me at work yesterday. I tried to get her to stay home because I didn't want her to drive on the highway. All I could picture was her getting into a gruesome collision or something. I didn't tell her this of course, but I did mention to her that I was feeling anxious. She came anyway and she was fine of course. 

The thing is, I just can't get these bad images out of my head. I keep picturing my family and boyfriend dying. I also have images of me dying in horrible ways (getting hit by a train, hit by a car on my bike etc.) They pop into my head at random times for no reason. I know I can just say ""this isn't real and my family is 100% okay"" but this is only partially true because they will die for real someday. My mom called me today and said she needed to talk and my heart SANK to the floor and I began to panic. She needed to talk about something COMPLETELY unrelated and in fact it was good news. I thought she was going to tell me someone was dead. 

I just can't get over the fact that someday this will happen for real and my close family and friends will die someday. I don't know what I will do. I don't know why I am freaking out about it right now because I have absolutely no reason to. My family is young and I have never had anyone close to me die. 

Does anyone else have this fear and how do you deal with it?",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d176z/do_anyone_else_have_unrealistic_thoughts_of_their/,1281812802
d19kg,depression,[deleted],I'm mad at myself.,"I don't know what's wrong with me. It's like I'm lying to everyone, including myself... and I hate it. Sometimes I randomly lash out at my family, and I feel like when I do I'm not thinking. Everything makes me cry. I feel dumb. I feel selfish and I don't want to. I want to be a better person. I've tried taking up hobbies, like making art and playing music. I like drawing, but I haven't been in the mood. I just can't. When I do make something, I feel unappreciated and sometimes I can't even look at it. I can't even look at myself in the mirror...I'm a monster.

A year back I took antidepressants (Lexapro, if you want to be specific). They didn't help much, but then again... I only took Lexapro for about 8 months until my parents wanted me off for some reason. Getting off the antidepressant made me just plain angry and extremely mood swingy; one moment I'm ""normal"", the next I'm just yelling at everyone, slamming doors, etc. I even lie for no apparent reason (obvious lying) and I doubt everything with everyone. With my angry emotions I even made my own mother cry. Even thinking about those moments about it makes me tear up. I don't even know why I act like this... it makes even sadder knowing that everyone around me is happy, being loved, and laughing. Laughing is a big deal to me. I realized I can't laugh. Instead, while back in school, I could laugh with a group of people, not just me being alone... I just forced myself to laugh to look normal. I don't want to lose my friends... but I have a feeling I am.

My best friend of 3-4 years is slowly losing touch with me. I knew it from the moment she began talking with other males on the internet, she started to text like crazy as well (2000+ messages a day). To her, it's normal... for me, it's not (BTW I'm a female). She and my other friend now only talk about men, partying, and just about people. They never used to be like this. Now whenever I talk to her, I don't know what to say. Instead... I play along and I hate it...

A few months back in class, I came in with obvious teary red eyes, eyeliner flaking all over my face, just looking like shit. My two friends are in that class with me, and they completely ignore me. Instead they're talking about stupid crap like her e-boyfriend or some shit like that. The night before that, I got into a huge fight with my family. They didn't even bother to say hi to me. Instead, they just continue talking. I remember I ran to the washroom... and then I was crying inside a stall. This other girl in my class saw me run to the washroom (class didn't start yet) and tried to comfort me. I thought it was a little strange at first because that girl was not very nice to other people, but nonetheless she comforted me. I spilled the beans to her about my family issues, how my family's falling apart and all that stuff. I really didn't mean to, but I had NOBODY to talk to. It's like even my closest friends don't give a shit about me, they don't listen to me. They don't even bother asking me how my day is, yet they lean on me when they're at their lowest. I feel so stupid, but I know I'm not.

I'm trying to change myself, but it's difficult. All I want is to be happy again, and not let my selfish attitude take over me. I try to control my random outbreaks, whether it's crying or throwing everything around. Even when I watched Toy Story 3, I cried like 5 damn times.  The little girl sitting beside me wasn't even crying... which is really embarrassing to me. But now I just don't care if people see my cry. I feel so mad at myself for hurting my family... for making them cry. I don't want to see them suffer because it's all my damn fault. It's not their fault, it's MINE. I screwed up. 

Also... sorry I might sound confusing with my shitty grammar and whatnot, but it's just because I'm so mad/upset/angry and I need to vent. I don't know what to do with myself. I want to change.... I want to be happy...",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d19kg/im_mad_at_myself/,1281832104

To make a very long story short (which is difficult, so bear with me) I found out that I was depressed about 3 years ago.  After failing out of college (large university), which was a surprise to my family after i whizzed through high school,  I was tested, sent to psychs, and was given the diagnosis that I've probably been depressed for most of my life (probably from age 6+) and probably have some slight ADD (yah, real fake ailments FTW).

I've tried several medications after going into a severe depression after the first and only person I trusted and loved (first girlfriend) went gay on me, nothing seems to agree with me.

I've been seeing a psychotherapist for 3 years now and it feels like we're just running around in circles.

Nowadays I rarely have the motivation to do anything productive.

I want to feel like I'm going somewhere... but I just don't even know what that feels like anymore.

I'm not fat, though my high school track physique is slowly fading... I'm not ugly, or so people tell me... I don't think i'm a TOTAL idiot, but who knows...

Right now I just feel like an absolute failure as a human being.  I hate myself, and have severe trust issues (see: not trusting anyone, ever)

d1z9k,depression,ffoffail,Another whiny post. Sorry.,"I hate doing this. I'm sorry, I'm sure you read posts like this all the time. I just would like some anonymous advice coming from an anonymous person. 

My family has a history of depression, alcoholism, and other serious mental disorders. I've accepted that I am very prone to receiving them, and more so accept that I have one. 

When I was 15 my depression started. I was accepting my sexual orientation (gay), getting a fresh new start in High School, and continuing a rocky relationship with my parents (we are very passionate people who refuse to admit when we are wrong). This made me feel very lonely and upset. I started drinking almost nightly to help deal with it. One night I was about to kill myself when one of my friends came to my house and forced me to stay alive. Ironically my parents never let me speak to this person again because they believe that she made me gay (they don't believe this anymore) and that she made me have depression. 

I started going to therapy after my parents found cut marks on my arm. My first therapist literally gave me an internet test and diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and wanted to prescribe me some sort of anti bipolar medication. We didn't take it because it was too early to say that I have depression. Later we found out that she was getting paid by the company that makes those medicines and she lost her license. None the less, this gave me a complete distrust towards psychiatrists.

I went to another therapist later on but did not enjoy it. I faked my way threw it because I didn't appreciate his attitude and the way he treated me and my religion/activities (running, I hated it, he loved it). I kept on going to him because my parents liked him and I figured I could give an hour of my week if it eases their mind. I convinced him, my parents, and I now think myself that I was okay and over my depression.

During the rest of high school I devoted myself to extracurricular activities, mostly Speech and Debate and our Green Club. I have never been the best student for some reason or another, but activities have been my forte. 

Fast forward to college/present day. I moved 4 hours away from home to go to college because I strongly disliked my hometown and felt that I needed a break from my parents. During college I decided to follow up on the same path that I left in High School. I devoted myself to extra curricular activities (College Democrats (which I'm the president of), Alliance (Activism and Communications chair), and I was part of my hall government before I moved out). My schoolwork hasn't been the best, but it hasn't been the worst. I changed my major from Computer Science to Politicial Science. 

I love politics so much that I applied for an internship working for the 2010 elections. This also gave me a chance to get a head start on our 2010 GOTV plan for our campus.

During college I've met some of the best people that I could imagine, including my best friend/boyfriend. I've been in two long relationships before (neither ended on bad terms, but just happened to end) and can honestly say that I have told him more about myself and opened up more to him than anyone else, and I know that he has done the same to me. My parents and my relationship has gotten much better. 

Despite everything going right for me I still feel like the biggest failure on the planet. I feel that I will never be able to move forward or make any sort of small difference in society. Despite me being in a relationship with an amazing guy who I trust more than anything I feel more alone than ever. For some reason I can't bare to tell him how depressed I have become because I fear that he will view me as whiny and spoiled (he comes from a much more difficult background than mine which is obviously a very lucky background with a few small kinks) and him leaving me. 

I have never felt more empty in my life. Despite finding the best friends, doing exactly what I want, having a great relationship, having a better relationship with my parents, an extremely fun internship where I've met a lot of great people and learned a lot about my interests.

d1ze5,depression,chimpastronaut,Made the mistake of trying alcohol for the first time. Its been 3 days and I'm more depressed than ever before.,"My life has gone far downhill since high school (im 19), Im attending a community college where pretty much nobody cares about anything. I am very passionate about my career in art and spend most of my time working on improving. I guess i should probably mention that becoming an artist is extremely competitive, and i take it very seriously. Because of this all but one of my friends has completely forgotten about me and I only have time to hang out with my friend once every 2-3 weeks are so.

3 days ago I had my brother buy me a drink so I could celebrate a summer of working hard. I drank it alone in my room and ended up getting buzzed. The feeling was amazing so much so that it scares me, I was happy and confident, two things I havent felt in years. I started having conversations with ease with people online I hadnt talk to in ages. I think the best part is that I didnt feel like myself, i felt like a better version of myself. For the past 2 days all I can think about is how I want to be buzzed again and how I hate being sober.

What are some good natural remedies that will help with depression? (I dont want to take medicine with side effects like suicide, also my doctor happens to be a family friend so it would be awkward to tell them I am depressed)

When do I know I can drink again without having to worry about being depressed right after or that i might become an alcoholic? How do normal people feel when they are sober compared to being buzzed?",11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d1ze5/made_the_mistake_of_trying_alcohol_for_the_first/,1282015830
d215i,depression,pullmeaside,I'm constantly sabotaging myself...,"I haven't even started writing yet and I know it isn't going to be easy to express exactly what I'm feeling, so thanks for reading it.

I've been depressed for a long time and it's only become worse as time goes on.  I can't say that I've ever *seriously* tried to commit suicide, but I know I'm incredibly reckless with my life.  I'm very indifferent about whether I live or die.  If you put a gun to my head I'm sure I'd cry like a baby though.  haha  I'm not indifferent to pain I guess.

My parents actually just recently discovered that I was seriously depressed.  I don't feel like going into how they came to that realization, but I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist soon after that.  I then proceeded to stop seeing both the psychiatrist and therapist a month or so later.

That brings me to what I think I really need advice on...  I'm constantly sabotaging myself and ruining things that *I know* would be beneficial to me.  It feels like half of me just wants to crash so hard that the earth opens up and swallows me.  I go through bouts of being ready and willing to get things done, but at some point I'll start feeling like I feel tonight and do my absolute best to burn everything I've worked for down.

It's so incredibly silly that I can't keep myself from laughing when I think about the absurdity of it.  Imagine a man burning his house down and then complaining that he doesn't have any stuff.  Imagine a kid kicking a sandcastle he built and then crying about it to his mother.  It's just stupid...

I want to succeed and at the same time I want see myself fail.  I don't want die, but at the same time I do want to die.  I want friends and lovers, but at the same time I want to be alone.  I feel ambivalent about **everything** and I don't know what to do to change that.  

I truly appreciate any advice you have to give, but even if you don't have anything to say thanks for taking the time to read this drivel.

d29fp,depression,[deleted],"Fuckin' Treadmills, You don't go anywhere.","Okay I'm not sure how I should write this. I want to be over the top and funny and offbeat because that is what I do when I'm stressed. I make the thing I'm worried about ridiculous. After all, it is very hard to take life's problems seriously when you put clown pants on them.

But, I think I should do this as a stream of thought instead. So here goes. **WARNING: INCOMING GAME**

Fuuuck me! What the fuck is it going to take? Okay, here's my life, it's not glamorous and it's a little bit cry moar emo kid but this is the low down: My parents make a decent amount of money, but they've always had something in the way of that, I had cancer for a long time (whooole other post) so there were bills when I was young. We lost our home in the start of the recession, 2007 part of Wave 1 of homeowners losing a place that had decades of memories wrapped up in it. They are still paying that off. 

Right now I'm in a strange situation as far as college goes. My family makes too much to qualify for needs based scholarships, nobody gives a fuck what you made in high school when you are 20 so there goes my academic funds. My family can't help me out because they're still paying off what they owe on their old home (life remains life all around I guess). Additionally, my mom hasn't been filing her taxes on time since...okay I'm not sure she's ever filed on time. This makes my FAFSA late and rejected every year going on three years now. Any schooling I take MUST be out of pocket. And when CC is 500 (well that includes a textbook which I didn't buy so 400) for one class that adds up. To date I've taken one class, loved it, but I don't have the money to attend this fall.

So why don't I find another path? Well I had a mini-stroke (don't know the latin name) when I was very young, my hand-eye as a result is maaaybe as good as a sixth grader, perhaps worse. In High School I was never allowed to turn in hand written assignments because they were unreadable to anyone but me. I've always loved playing sports and working with my hands but I've never been any good at it. The trades are a no-no, I just do have the precision of hand. Fuck me.

The military is not a fan of cancer survivors, or at least they weren't when I tried to enlist. Medical waiver denied. Fuck me.

I've been saving my money up, being frugal and wise with my spending these past years but every time I think I'm good something terrible happens. A fender bender due to air in my brake lines is leaving me without any money at all and a serious worry that I'll be unable to pay rent. Fucking, fuck me.

At this point I just feel lost, I wanted earlier to pursue a career teaching high school but recent legistlation looks like the profession is just going to get worse. I'm making enough to get by doing data entry but I feel like I'm going to be stuck here...well not forever, that would be being melodramatic, but for a long time, 25 at the earliest as I can't seem to keep money in the bank, just random life shit gets in my way.

All this has made me just weary, not depressed, or maybe depressed but I'm okay most days. Just in general I am tired of trying so hard only to have it blow up. My friends make is seem so effortless. I've got one who just scored a high paying internship, another who is doing really well in state school, another at MIT and another living at home, being able to put every cent he makes in savings and then go to an expensive private school his grandparents are paying for until he figures out what his major will be. 

I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt some resentment. I know it's wrong and I don't stew in it, in fact I banish the thought every time it arises. Lifes not fair and it's not their fault they got the long staw. 

So here I am, two years closing on three out of high school and not a cent, and only 4 credit hours to show for it. I feel proud for surviving the shit I've gone through but at the end of the day, I'm swiming through rough waters being proud of myself for keeping my head above water, and not choking to death while everyone around me *surfs away.* My title refers to a treadmill because that is how I feel. You run and you run and you don't get anywhere and you are left wondering ""Why the fuck was I running in the first place?""

Fuck it, even with a dead end job I'm still doing better than most people in the world. I shouldn't even be complaining. Though I do feel a little better now.

So now I have to go there and pick up my pay for fucking 7 hours and then maybe go cry myself to sleep because I am seriously fucked. Completely fucked. I have $20 to my fucking name and no gas, and I just told my parents I got a job and within an hour I don't. What do I even tell them? I feel like a fucking piece of shit because what good am I if I can't keep a fucking simple job for more than a day? It took me 4 fucking months to find that job. 

I'm seriously upset. I called and asked them to reconsider, while trying to explain myself. it's probably just some fake reason to not keep me there though because they're fucking assholes I guess. So now I feel worthless and useless and I just failed every single person that cares for me. They were so happy I finally found a job, and I told them all how great my first day went... then bam! 2 hours later, fuck you go die.

d2e09,depression,[deleted],End of summer blues,"I'm a 21 year old guy, going to be a senior in college. For as long as I can remember, starting school again in the fall has been tough for me. And this year is no different. I had an awesome summer. I spent a lot of time outside and at the beach. Did things with my family. Hung out with my best friends. Partied. Went to baseball games. Went on a few awesome vacations. Worked a little and made some money. And met a girl I'm crazy about. But now it feels like it's all collapsing.

My classes don't start until Sept. 7, so I have a few weeks before I move back. But other schools start sooner. As a result, my brother has already left. My mom is starting to work again (she's a teacher). One of my good friends has left for school, and another is set to leave this Saturday. My friend group in general is starting to dwindle. There are still a few people around, but as I've found in years past, there becomes fewer and fewer things to do as August draws to a close, and I usually end up sitting around trying to kill time.

The girl I had been seeing also went back to school yesterday (we go to different different schools). Even though I knew from the beginning that we were going to have to go our separate ways, it's hitting me much harder than I anticipated. I think this is kind of setting off the rest of my feelings. I wasn't expecting much other than a summer fling, but it turned into much more than that. We talked every day over the last few weeks. And after being single for almost a year, it felt really good to have someone interested in how my day was and then being able to cuddle up together. And it sucks because we both want to be together, but there's nothing we can do about it.

And so now I'm at home with nothing to do but think about the things that stand before me this year. I'm going to be a senior and taking some tough classes. This is it. Crunch time. And the thought of being out in the ""real world"" after this year is almost overwhelming right now. Even things that were supposed to be fun are bringing me down. I'm in charge of planning a ski trip for my snowboard club at school, and even that is stressing me out immensely. 

I don't know what to do. I hate feeling like this. It's happened to me in the past, but I've never really found a good way to deal with it. It just feels like there's nothing to look forward to.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d2e09/end_of_summer_blues/,1282095845

d2v4p,depression,shaba7elail,Are you heart broken? I have good news for you!,"I've been in love with a woman for 9+ years. She meant everything to me, I loved her more than I loved myself. She was the meaning to my life and my inspiration. 

I had always had an I-can-accomplish-anything attitude and despite our differences I tried EVERYTHING I could think of to make us work but.. we didn't. There was finally a point when I came to accept that there's nothing more I could do and it was time to reclaim control of my life. Honestly, I never thought such a time would come; I thought that if we were to ever go our separate ways it would be because she grew apart from me and stopped looking back. I never thought that I'd be capable of voluntarily letting her go. But, I did. 

Eight month ago, I made a new year's resolution to find a way to be whole again without her. I decided that if I could accomplish this, it would restore my self image and trust in myself, I would know that I truly can accomplish anything because this is the hardest commitment I'll ever make. Since then I've made a lot of changes in my life. Her absence created a big hole I had to fill with meaning and I set out to do just that. I went back to school and I'm currently in the honors college at my university majoring in both Computer Science and Physics, I've learned to play the piano and I'm getting better every day, I finally took my fitness goals seriously and I'm kicking one bad habit after another.. I'm very proud of my accomplishments over the past 8 months; every day I'm getting closer to becoming the person I've always wanted to be.

The key is to focus on yourself and love yourself. I had always thought that this was some stupid bullshit people who have never truly been depressed say but it isn't! You have to become your own best friend, you have to be patient, supporting, loving, caring and rewarding. Imagine the person you love most being sad or sick, how would you feel? what would you do? That is how you need to treat yourself. If you can accomplish that then you'll come to realize that you don't need anyone or anything to complete you or make you happy. From then on, every obstacle that comes your way becomes no more than an inconvenience because you've proved to yourself that you can get through it.

I'd like to also mention that I didn't go to therapy (although I highly recommend it if you have the means and need it) but I did read a lot about cognitive-behavioral therapy which was the biggest help in changing my thought patterns. I had been depressed for years but now I've never been happier and it will only get better, I will make sure of it!

I wish you all the best of luck!",10,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d2v4p/are_you_heart_broken_i_have_good_news_for_you/,1282190377
d326l,depression,meanbitch,Overcoming jealousy/negative feelings towards normal friends,"Hello...

I'm a shy (social phobiac actually) person (28 years old) with an history of depression (since age 16) and anxiety (since age 12, generalized, with a few specific phobias like phones, talking to strangers, etc... It comes and goes in waves.)

I have very few friends, partly because I basically run away or hide in a corner at every social occasion, and partly because I'm a batshit crazy bitch who will alienate them as soon as I stop being uber attentive to what I say or do around them.

At the time being, I have *two* remaining friends, and have lost contact with most of my family except my mother (who is quickly getting bored at having to rescue me when I'm a sobbing mess).


The current problem is: I can't stand it when my friends accomplish something I feel I'll never be able to do. (The friends are a bit younger and geeky, and not the most social persons either, but they DO have lives). Getting cars (I'm afraid of crossing the street, can't fathom driving ever), good jobs, going out at parties (where I'm usually in a corner waiting for the torture to end), and most notably getting a sex life. 

My friend number 2 (previously asexual) just got his first girlfriend. He's an awesome guy. Seriously, he's witty, relatively hot (err, I have no libido but I'm a graphist, I can recognize suitable body structures), extremely kind, patient and talented. He deserved to have someone.

Well, my reactions were hatred, extreme despair and suicidal thoughts. Luckily, for once, I got the news over the internet, so I could take a few minutes to react and tell him how happy I was for him.

I say luckily because when I get those kind of news face to face, all self-control flies out the window now matter how hard I try. I either start sobbing, or I manage NOT to cry and turn to full blown verbal aggression (and end up with one less friend, because people don't like psychos). 

It's not even that I *want* a boyfriend, it is that I know that I could never *manage* to. I flee and panic when people flirt with me, and my only attempt at sex ended because I panicked to much to manage to remove my underwear. I am that worthless and inapt.

I've been crying for a few hours now, and could use either a good shaking or slap in the face, either tips to keep the anger and self hatred at bay. Or at least some ideas not to lash out at friends when they have done nothing wrong. 


-------


Edit: I called back my doctor about the neuropsychiatrist he was supposed to refer me to, but turns that person is in holiday at the moment, and I think I'd rather wait for the my generalist to refer me, as he described the psychiatrist as ""excellent"" and it would give him a medical point of view of the shaking mess I was when I talked to the generalist.

I also *temporarily* removed everyone from my IM contact lists except those who are aware of my issues, so I don't alienate the few people who still talk to me. Will add them back once I'm better. 

I have also tried to get my mind out of it (keeping myself busy, visiting family while staying away from the depression topic since they don't believe it exists) and trying to do a few things for work (otherwise I get guilty because they pay me for doing nothing, insurance doesn't kick in until after a month of medical leave here). 

The new meds are keeping me mostly calm and lucid if there is no trouble, but I still break down at every little difficulty. Still, I use the periods of lucidity to try to get myself up. 

-----

Edit sept 1: Went back to the doctor, who gave me another med to help with the bouts of rage, though he said specifically he started at the lowest dosage and it might not be enough, but we'll see about increasing it if it doesn't work. I mostly managed to stop raging at the lovebirds (giving myself work and distractions helped), and can now think of the involved lady without feeling murderous and/or nauseous. Have given my best wishes to my friend.

d3b08,depression,berbarbur,Is this depression?,"Here's my situation: I'm 22, and just relocated from a small town to a big city, over a thousand miles from home. I've been here for several weeks, trying to find a place to live (which I now have), trying to find a job (25 applications in the past week or two, no success yet), and trying to lose some weight (not progressing like I'd hoped). Before I came here, I had an acute attack of total despair, self-doubt, worry, wondering why I'm even alive. I felt like, if I fuck this up (my plans to relocate), I'll be humiliated and no one will take me seriously. But if I back down, I'll look indecisive and no one will take me seriously. I worry a lot that I'm behind the curve developmentally in my age group, as I still have very little in the way of work experience, life experience, and education, whereas many of my peers are now graduating college, enjoying an ongoing series of romantic relationships (I've never had anything close to one, or much of a social life for that matter), and generally getting their shit together.

Since my arrival, I've mostly managed to stay positive. I don't think I've been ""depressed"" in the intervening weeks, though it's been very hard to stay encouraged with no friends and hardly anyone to talk to. This is why I doubt whether my condition could rightly be called depression; clinical texts like DSM4 define it as a persistent state lasting at least two weeks at a time. Mine only lasts a few days at most, before I go back to the baseline of just feeling ""meh"" with occasional moments of happiness. I'm not experiencing ""anhedonia.""

A girl I knew a long time ago reconnected with me on Facebook the other day (she coincidentally lives in this city), and she suggested meeting up and discussing old times or something. This put me in a state of panic and despair. I feel like I'd be embarrassed to even show my bloated awkward face to her and contrast her beauty/social grace with my total lack thereof.

I don't feel suicidal or anything, but I have been wandering around town alone tonight on the verge of tears, just thinking I'd be better off getting terminal cancer. I can see that I have pretty low self-esteem, but I feel it's in many ways justified.

My question is, is this clinical depression, or is this just a passing phase caused by the loneliness and uncertainty of my new life?",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d3b08/is_this_depression/,1282278215
d3bwj,depression,famousninja,With a little help from... shit.,"You may have to bear with me on this.

Throughout my life, I've been known as the go-to guy for difficult problems for a lot of people I know, ranging from simple advice on what guitar to buy, through to helping a very close friend through a difficult depression. (I was proud of that day, a combination of letting him know people cared as well as large doses of Strapping Young Lad got him back on track)

However, I just moved out of where I have lived for the past 23 years, to the other side of the city I live in, over an hour from all the people I've helped out and care about.

I moved out here because I recently changed jobs, earning more money, but it would take over an hour &amp; a half driving to get to work. This ended up taking too much of a toll on finances, which I had taken a lot of time getting back on top of, another matter of pride for myself.

So I've been isolated from all the peeps that I've grown up with, all the facilities which I would use to help cope with some of my quirkier personality traits. (Stuff like restaurants, venues, pubs etc.) Pretty much for every decent pub, restaurant, bar near my hometown has been replaced by a church.

So pretty much all I do is get up, go to work, come home and play video games non-stop, only emerging on weekends to jam with mates on the occasional fortnight, or to travel out to visit people.

However, it always seems like it's up to me to initiate things, always asking what people are up to on a weekend and invite myself along. I know that they don't mind, but I feel like a fifth wheel at times, just calling and asking ""what's going on?""

The final issue that I have at this point, is due to my isolation, I've been missing out on a lot of social gatherings, where the majority of my friends have started getting into relationships, which really shouldn't bother me. It never has, but just recently seeing the more dweebish (other than myself) dude in the group hook up with a lady, it's got me questioning what exactly I'm doing wrong.

I hate to just dump all of this, but with the people I know, it's really hard for me to vent about this, because I've been the unbending pillar of advice and counsel for a lot of my friends, and they have enough of their own burdens.

I know these problems are minor, but they keep building up, and it's all the little things that are starting to make me crack, like the fact that I can't get a decent pizza is driving me batty.

It's not really major, but It just sucks not having anyone to talk to about this.

d4c6n,depression,sakatana,"Well, here goes...","A bit about myself: I'm a 23 (in 2 weeks) year old college male ""studying"" computer science. I'm half Japanese and half Swedish and have been called ""a twinkie"" more than a few times by full blooded Koreans and Chinese on campus. I'm more over weight than I'd like to admit but I do enjoy playing sports with friends and such. My family has a history of mental illness and addiction on both sides which is a bit worrisome. I'm not in the habit of making novelty accounts and will take all required flak here. I've been reading /r/depression quite often in the last few weeks and working up the stones to post, so here goes!

Before you read the following: I don't want the speech on suicide. I have no suicidal intentions and I've been like this for a while. My friend killed himself when I was in high school and I remember it devistating **everyone**, even people who didn't know him well and I have no intention on putting anyone through that.

**Warning:** *Cliche content incoming.* 

I'm sure everyone has seen the videos where they talk about depression, how the people in the videos always say things like ""I feel down"" or ""I just want to sleep forever."" In high school, I always scoffed at this and thought that they were joking and just being cliche but more recently I've had thoughts like ""I wish I could just 'not exist' for a few weeks."" I sometimes think that a coma would be awesome. I occasionally have to remind myself of my own rule and stay on my side of the road while driving... I realize that these things are cliche for a reason and this is a sign that I should talk to someone about it.

Accompanying my everlasting melancholy comes three things. First is the feeling of boredom. I can't keep myself interested in anything, I can't focus on anything, it just doesn't seem to work.  The second thing that I get is the inability to motivate myself. This relates to the first in the fact that I can't kick my own ass into gear to get even the most basic school work done. Nothing seems fun, everything is boring and it makes the days painful to get through. My grades in college are falling rapidly and if I don't suck it up and get my shit done, I'm going to fail out of school; I'm already entering my 6th year without even having a degree. Third: I lose confidence in myself. Everything is an uphill struggle when it comes to doing things alone. Sometimes I just give up without even trying because I can't put forth the effort because I think I'll just fail.

This face, that I am dispalying now, is not one that I enjoy but it seems to be my default one as of late. Everyone that I have run into thinks that I'm a generally happy person but, as far as I can ""rationalize"" it, I can't show this current face to these people. I have to wear a mask when interacting with everyone  and I feel terrible for decieving my friends, family and even people who I have just met (whoo, I guess that means I'm not a sociopath!). I can't display this face easily to friends and it would be nearly impossible to show it to my family. A few friends know that I'm pretty constantly depressed and they are helpful but I always feel like a burden on them (so instead, I'm going to bother the general population of /r/depression - yay.) 

I always engage in pseudo-self-destructive behavior when I feel like this, as well. At the beginning of the summer, I was trying to not drink any soda or other drinks, I was trying not to snack and was trying to eat better. In the last few weeks, I've spent more money on Taco Bell than I'll be willing to admit because it's down the street from my parent's place and is fast. I've probably consumed a case of Mountain Dew in the last three days and I have been playing World of Warcraft almost non-stop from the minute I wake up until the minute I go to bed (Though, about 2 hours ago, I nuked my WoW folder and cancelled my subscription).

The thing that pisses me off the most about feeling like this is that I have zero fucking reason to. I hate that I feel like crap all the time because my life is pretty awesome. I have awesome friends, awesome parents, my awesome cat is sleeping on my bed. I have a car, my debt isn't sky-high, I'm reasonably intelligent, albiet quite lazy. In terms of physical fitness, I'm very out of shape but I can work on that and usually feel better about myself if I don't sit on my ass all day. With the exception of the last few weeks, I had been losing weight. 

TL;DR: I feel like a living cliche. Can't motivate myself to do anything, college grades suck, confidence is non-existent, always bored. Can't talk to friends or family and I'm destroying all my hard work... for no logical reason.

d4cox,depression,Sir_tokesalot,What are your opinions on cannabis use and depression?,"As of late I have come to the realization that depression has been affecting me in episodes most likely related to my social life (or lack there of). So I decided to wonder on over here and found people turning to psychiatrists and psychologist. This didn't surprise me and it sounded like a good idea. But upon further inspection I saw that people have been using medications to deal with their symptoms. Now I have no experience with any medications related to depression or anything like that, but i do have experience with marijuana and it seems to help a great deal with symptoms of depression even long after the high has worn off. Most people freak out at the mere mention of the substance, but it is nothing to be afraid of and many people believe it is more effective, healthier (yes cannabis can be good for you), and safer than these medications. But this is just my opinion and I would love to hear what all of you have to say about using marijuana in place of medications for depression.

How?,"I currently struggle with depression, social anxiety disorder, panic attacks and am extremely bored with life.  I’ve been seeing a psychologist every 2 weeks for the last 10 months or so but don’t feel as though I’m making any progress whatsoever.  A common theme in self-help material seems to be to cut negative things and negative people out of your life but I’m becoming more aware that I actually *am* the negative person they are referring to.  I expect the worst from people and as such I dislike everybody I meet until they can prove otherwise.  I’m not happy with the person I am or the life that I lead so my immediate response is to judge, dismiss, and undermine others in an attempt to make myself feel better, although it never seems to work.  The happier somebody is, the more I seem to hate them.  Has anybody been in this same place and been able to overcome these issues?  How did you do it?  (For the record, i'm currently just over 30 and this has steadily worsened since i was about 25)

To make a long story short - I've had 3 surgeries in one year. I'm about to potentially have another one. I've had two doctors refuse to see me even though I've been doubled over in pain because a.1 was my old gyno and he said he doesn't have anything left to treat even though my pain is probably from endo and adhesions from having 3 surgeries on my female parts which resulted in finally having a full hysterectomy. 2. My gastro (that my gyno shoved me off on) wouldn't see me until i had a colonoscopy which I don't need because it's the exact same pain as before which was always relieved after surgery. 

I'm tired of doctors and not knowing and being depressed and tired and everything else that goes with this. I've recently taken up hermiting. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal though it does cross my mind.

d5kdc,depression,cantmove,Please help. I can't move.,"I'm 19 right now. Studying electrical engineering, 2nd year somewhere in Asia. I've been struggling with depression for maybe about 6 or 7 years now. I appear pretty normal to my friends, and am not lacking a social life. I've attempted suicide before. Though I know I won't commit suicide (I don't want to hurt my loved ones), a voice in the back of my head still wants me to do it. I do sometimes feel that it's the best way to end my suffering.

In my country, men don't cry, and depression is an imaginary sickness. I've had a psychiatrist after my suicidal episode and tried anti-depressants (a generic local Prozac - we can't afford branded medicine) which didn't really help at all. Before I got to ask about my psychiatrist about trying other meds, my mom decided I was fine and we stopped seeing her, and I stopped my medication too. My family pretty much believes that I don't need some bullshit therapy and I should just man up and go on. I can't really.

I haven't gone to class the whole week already. I just can't. I can feel it physically. My chest feels so heavy. I can barely breathe. My limbs just don't want to move. Last week, when I did go to class, I would just stare blankly, and even if I try to pay attention, everything just blurs out and words become gibberish.

My country is a hellhole. All I want is to get out of this country with my girlfriend (true love, best thing ever, 6 years - not a problem, not a factor) and start off somewhere safer, more peaceful and relaxed. My parents want me to be an engineer (again, I'm Asian), because they think that's the best way for me to get out of here. Sadly I think that may be true. I have all the capacity to be one (IQ 150-160+ depending on tests), but I'd rather do something that would involve 'me' more like working at a hotel or a restaurant or managing something. I'm quick to learn, but I don't really feel like I'm learning anything in college. I'd rather work and learn firsthand than sit in a classroom.

Any help about anything at all would be appreciated. Ideally, I should go to my classes, tough it out for 4 more years and get and Engineering degree that might just get me out of this country. But right now, my mind and my body are non functional. However, I do feel that I still won't be happy working as an Engineer.

I wish I was born in Europe. This country gives me a heavy feeling of weltschmerz.

**edit:** I think I'm feeling something like Hikikomori. I've been having difficulty leaving my house, even when I'm completely set to go. This morning (gmt +8) I found myself just unable to step outside. I do, however, have a healthy amount of friends, am not socially lacking, nor do I suffer from an inferiority complex.

d5mv4,depression,runwithme,I'm hanging off a ledge holding on to a piece of rope...,"...under me is a giant black hole that I can never escape from. I am hanging in mid-air holding on to this rope for dear life, if I let go I will never be able to climb back up. 

There is a man on a ledge holding the other end of this rope, he is trying to pull me up. As he tries to pull me up the rope is stretching, no matter how much he pulls I remain in the same spot but the rope...it is getting thinner and thinner. It is apparent to both of us that eventually either this rope will break or he will get tired and let go. 

Who is this man? I can't make out his face but he looks familiar. He refuses to give up, he is holding on this rope with all his might but his grip starts to loosen. I see him struggling but the rope is slipping through his fingers. He looks down at me and says, ""I'll never let go, as long as you don't give up hope."" and then he ties the rope around his waist. He isn't giving up, if I go down, he will go down with me. 

Why? 
The only question in my mind is: Why? Why is he doing this for me? 

Then it hits me, I recognize his voice, I look at him again and I realize why he looks familiar. He isn't saving me, he is saving himself. He and I are the same. He is me and I am him.

Take drugs, find love, know that your life is important and makes a difference?  Well I'm not interested in masking the problem, I've heard all the mantras and all the self delusion and lies.  My life is not meaningful and I can see that quite clearly.  

I've often thought about going into politics, but do I really need new goals?  Is this just another subtle mask?  I'm creating new problems and struggles so I concentrate on those and not on whatever it is that troubles me.  It occurs to me, that maybe, just maybe, that's life?  Ignorance isn't bliss, distractions are.  From cradle to grave caring about nothing which matters in exchange for happiness.  Are we social because we don't want to be alone, and do we not want to be alone because we don't want to think about what it means to be alive?

Sometimes I want to run, be a hermit.  How to commit suicide without actually dying.  But if you run someone will chase.  I'm not crying for help, I'm not looking to be found.  I just don't even know if I want to be happy, how fucked up is that?  I needed to tell someone.  Mostly because I want someone to tell me I'm crazy or chemically imbalanced so I don't have to worry anymore.

d615t,depression,derektherock42,I've been very sentimental lately,"I've had clinical depression for at least 4 years now. It's a routine that's probably going to continue for the rest of my life: one month everything's fine, then the next my whole world is falling apart and I'm a worthless piece of shit. Then it passes, everything is fine, then everything's not fine. This has been repeating for as long as I've had depression. 

Lately I've been having really weird thoughts that make me extremely sad for some reason. Like I can't stop thinking about my old high school chemistry teacher. I was in a bad place in my life, and I was silent almost the whole time. I was rejected by pretty much everybody because I didn't talk and I acted weird a lot. And I always looked sad, even though I wasn't so much. My teacher somehow saw goodness in me, which I still can't believe. She would ask me how my weekend was, and we'd get into conversations. She had a good sense of humor, the rare kind that I can connect with. Almost half of the time, I never turned my homework in just because I was in a bad cycle of being hopeless and lazy and not doing anything I was supposed to. She would actually meet with me after school to help me with what I wasn't understanding. That's dedication most high school teachers would never dream of giving students, especially someone like me who wasn't even putting forth much effort. 

Anyways, these days she keeps coming back into my mind. Not in a romantic way; I've wondered about that (she was twenty-something), but after doing some soul-searching I can safely say there's nothing romantic about it. I just keep randomly flashing back to her teaching, or her talking, or whatever. It's really kind of creepy. Maybe. Or maybe it's just that great teachers stick with people.

d63w5,depression,ItsColdOutside,I think I am on a slippery slope,"Before I start please forgive me, my thoughts are all over the place and this may not make sense. 

I have been slowly falling into what I think is a deeper depression for about 5 years. I have days where I am ok, I can have fun and laugh with my friends. But as soon as its over I am just... I don't even know what to call it other than depressed. I start having this semi existential crisis about why I should even try. Morning have been getting harder, although I get up and go to work just fine (cant concentrate for shit at work though, this is becoming a problem). Its gotten to the point where I can't stand to be alone because somehow having people around staves off these feelings. I think this may be because I put up a wall for people, maybe this distracts me... I don't know... 

I don't even know if I belong in this sub... I feel like saying I am depressed is an insult to people who actually need help, but I can feel it getting worse... I am functional right now, but I can tell people are wanting to be around me less. I no longer get excited about the things I used to. 

About 6 months ago I had knee surgery and they gave me Oxycontin. When I took those pills I felt so normal. I know it was artificial. I know that everyone feels better on them. But I also know that feeling happy like that is supposed to be attainable in life from time to time. I have resisted taking more since the surgery, but I long for that feeling. I am afraid that I will find some if I do not address this part of me that seems to be growing. I took the bottle and never got it refilled, it scared me how much I wanted it. I destroyed it. 

Nobody knows I feel this way, I don't know how to bring it up. My girlfriend of 6 years doesn't know. But I can tell its weighing her down. I rely on her more and more to get through the day and its not fair to her...

He'll think I'm overreacting. He a ""pull yourself together and get on with it"" type.

d6k5t,depression,paintpaint,All I want is a hug from someone who really cares about me.,"Hello, Reddit.
I am an 18 year old guy. 
I am in my last year of school now, and I know I should be working really hard to get a good degree.
I find it extremely hard to focus on important but unenjoyable things such as homework or school, I can hardly stay alert to a topic that doesn't interest me for an hour which is why my grades in school aren't the best ones in classes that I'm not interested in, like, for example mathematics. On the other hand, I do score really good grades in classes i am interested in, like philosophy and politics. 
But whenever I decide do do my homework, I drift away and start thinking about other stuff. I know this sounds rather common, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that I just can't work on things I don't like. I really can't. But I need to.
So today, my parents wrote me a very serious letter telling me to work harder because these months will decide over my future. Which is true.

This made me think about myself too.

If you meet me first, you will probably think of me of a happy, friendly, active, and intelligent person. I do lots of different activities, including ""cool"" extreme sports and so on. I like to think that I know what to wear, I am not particularly ugly and I don't stand out in a negative way. I find it easy to talk to people and to make new contacts and I think that I'm not stupid. 

But inside, I feel really bad and hopeless.
When people spend more time with me, they realize that all those ""cool"" things, the ""underground"" music I listen to, the sports I do, the cloths I wear are only coverups for my real self. They are like accessories. Since I spend so much time with maintaining my cool self, I feel like my real self is slowly dying and the artificial me is becoming myself. Because of that, although I do have social contacts, I party, do sports, etc, nobody really wants to be my friend.
I realized yesterday that I don't  have any true friends. The people I spend my time with spend time with the artificial me. They don't know me and if they did, they wouldn't spend time with me. 

I am very afraid of my future.

All I want is someone who knows me, nobody does right now, a hug from someone who really cares about what I think and am, it's really all that I need. 

But i can't just take off my mask. 

I had suicidal thoughts in the last few hours but I know that I couldn't do that, especially because of my parents. But if it weren't for them, there would be no reason for me not to do it.

I just wanted to write this down, this has already helped me, so i might as well post it. 

TL;DR: Average depressed teenager.

**EDIT** :
thanks for your replies, i feel a lot better already, read through some other questions on here and realized that this is quite normal in my age. life's ahead of me, if i worry too much i won't change a thing, I'll just have to keep going through this and it'll be alright. I'll start being more honest and true to people, that will help me find out who really likes *me*. 
I have the feeling like my relationship with my parents is getting worse though, Them writing a letter to me instead of talking to me hurt me. 
I also thought about ways to make new contacts since this would be easier than to change the relationship I already have with my friends.

d6m1j,depression,MidnightTurdBurglar,Feeling of resignation brought on by the low quality of my fellow man,"The late few years I have started succumbing to this feeling of emptiness or withdrawal that seems to partly if not largely stem from the nature of society. My whole life I have dedicated myself to working towards the benefit of all and trying to improve the overall nature of the world. Yet when I look around, I see the overwhelming effort by the rest of humanity to not care, or just in general be part of the problem instead of the solution. I'm thinking about it presently as I was just scammed out of some money on the streets today and I am racked over the type of person who could do such a thing and how I have never, and could never, do what they did. This particular incident is inconsequential. But the observations leading me to this conclusion are pervasive: everything from the everyday-type sight of watching a person throw a candy wrapper into the streets to using sloppy ""facts"" in arguments to poor parenting. There's just such much fault in the world and I cannot comprehend why humanity allows it to exist, let alone generate it! It's hard to justify the argument without sounding like an ego-maniacal and arrogant jerk but without question the world would be better and have less suffering if more people acted as I do. This isn't so much a feeling of being better than everyone else, but one of most everybody else being worse than me in quantifiable ways. I suppose that's elitism. Maybe it's not a bad thing. I have maintained hope that I can help change the world for the better but the battery is wearing out. It's exhausting rolling a boulder uphill only to know that it will eventually roll back down. :-(

d6pm6,depression,anonidonteven,What works?  I'm so tired of trying.,"I've been depressed roughly as long as I can remember.  Not all the time, but &gt;50%, with swings that last an hour to a couple weeks. I'm 24, married with kids, a solid career, and live in what most would call paradise.  However, I still suffer lack of motivation, self confidence, etc.  To put it in perspective, I shave, say, twice a month, and haven't had a haircut in 6, just because I don't care.  I work from home, so there's no one to impress. My wife's tired of trying to help or even listening, and has said as much multiple times.  It seems like everyone who knows me IRL knows the side of me I think they want me to show them, and no one gets the whole picture.  My parents had me on various antidepressants from 15-18 (you name it I was on it.) and while they made the depression go away, I also stopped having feelings of any kind.  Everyone(wife, family, inlaws) says that I should go back on them because they liked who I was on them -- I'm of the opinion that they just liked that I was malleable.  I've been seeing a shrink for the last 4 months (under ultimatum of divorce, it was that or the pills), and he seems to think that basically nothing's actively wrong, and I should just actively fight depressive thoughts.  Well if I could do that, they wouldn't be depressive thoughts.  The happiest i've been is the 6 months after my daughter was born, but then we moved across the country and now I'm worse off than ever.  I'm an outcast in my family for being so far away, my church here for being an outsider(I've emailed the pastor that took me in as a disciple two spiritual questions this month with no reply), my inlaws think I'm insane, my wife's given up.  I don't know what to do.  I'm not suicidal or i'd be over in /r/sw, but I have to admit the idea is tempting at the lowest of times.  I just want to be in control of my own mind.  Every day the positive feedback loop continues, seeing the pain my depression causes in those around me, and that only makes it worse.  How do I break out?  I feel like I've tried all the normal solutions, but nothing's working.  So, what *does* work?

tl;dr: I guess don't bother.  Maybe I thought venting into the abyss of the internet would somehow make a difference.  ",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d6pm6/what_works_im_so_tired_of_trying/,1283042120
d6q9i,depression,Winter42,Getting more depressed as the days go on.,"I recently started college a few days ago. I thought things would be better, and that I wouldn't be such an introvert and shy person, but I just can't seem to change. 

I've been depressed for a few years now, ever since my sophomore year of high school. I had one or two really great friends, and they helped me out a lot. Now I'm in a school where I know practically nobody.

I never even wanted to go to this certain school, but money issues forced me. It's considered a ""party school"", but I'm not really that type of person at all. 

I have never been good with making friends, and have always been a rather shy person. I don't seem to have anything in common with the people I have met, and they don't seem like they want to get to know me either. I feel like there is something wrong with me, and that is why I can't make friends, or form relationships. 

I've been told to just go out and try to talk to people, but I just can't bring myself to do it. So I end up sitting alone when I eat, and why I'm in my dorm now, alone, on a Saturday night yet again. 

All of this is making me extremely depressed. I've never felt this bad before, even in my most depressed moments in high school. I honestly don't know what to do anymore, and have been considering some things that I would rather not think about right now.

d6rto,depression,alsoathrowawayalso,"I need some help, if you could...","Hi. Thanks for reading... I'm a 21 year-old female, and I hate that I feel the way I do. I'm struggling and nobody knows, and I'm exhausted. Sometimes it feels like there might be something terribly wrong inside my mind which makes me feel the way I do. Sometimes it seems like there's something terribly wrong with the world outside my mind. Sometimes I feel like a Mother and everyone and everything else is just a child who doesn't know anything about how life should be. But I am only one person, and so I am outnumbered, and most of the time I end up feeling like the one who doesn't ""get"" the way things are. I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I've always been well-liked; I have friends. I ""party"". I socialize. Sometimes I force myself to. Other times I don't even force myself to, and so I don't. Guys are interested until they get too close and I inevitably screw things up. It seems like I can't let good things happen to me. I'm seen on the outside as a laid-back, fun, happy and without-cares person. I'm so exhausted of keeping up these appearances. I do believe that life is beautiful, and there are things in the world which remind me of this, but most of the time the world and the place it's become, besides nature itself, seems unnatural. I feel incredibly screwed up. I don't feel connected to most of the shit I have to come into contact with on a daily basis as part of society. Music is one of the things I do connect with. There's a song written by Jeff Buckley called Eternal Life. If you know it, this song makes me think he would understand exactly how I feel. They say he drowned, but I believe he just stopped floating and sometimes I feel like doing the same. Some days I feel alright, and then the next day I could feel terrible. I definitely feel increased surreal-ness induced by smoking weed, creating higher levels of anxiety about feeling this way and being so self-aware of it. Despite this, during those times I feel connected to something deeper in life than the shit I'm so fucking depressed over, and it makes me feel better until I come down and realize that existing is not the same as that life element of which everything is created and which feels natural compared to the existence I feel forced to live in. I don't even know if I'm making sense to anyone right now. I could write more eloquently about this, and take more time, but I'm so tired and the feelings today have been bad. I feel like over the past three years I've been to the edge of my brain and back mulling over all the ""why's?"" to how I feel, and I do feel as though I've made some sense to myself at least, especially in terms of recognizing that it seems like I see the world differently than most, or that they at least don't seem to have to spend so much energy not feeling unwanted sadness, alienation, etc, etc. I'm tired of this. I don't feel like I've really explained myself correctly, but I'm too tired to try harder right now. If anyone recognizes anything in this jumble of words and thoughts which they might be able to relate to in a positive light for myself, please let me know if I'm not alone. That sounds horribly cliche, but it would be some small comfort right now. Even though, apparently, I've reduced myself to seeking comfort from strangers... I would appreciate it.

d6s5v,depression,CometAppears,Everything thing just sucks. ,"For a long, long time I've felt that my life is just awful. I feel as if everything is just closing in all around me. Last night at around 3AM my eyes snapped open after an uneventful dream, and I went out into the dark and just walked for hours. All I thought about was how much of a failure I am, what I've done what I haven't achieved. I kept thinking why did I have to be the oldest in my family? Why do I have to be the one to experience everything first? Why is it when I do experience things first that I fail so badly at them?

I'm 20 years old, and I've NEVER had a job. I've NEVER asked girl out, and never been on a date. I've not had my ""first kiss"". I skipped my high school graduation/prom, because I felt that going without a date would be worse than no going at all. I dropped out of University last year, because I couldn't handle the math for business (which was only a cop-out anyway because I didn't know what to do). I've lost contact with the friends I did have growing up (the guys on my street/block) and the people I knew in high school. I don't have contact with anyone my own age, and I'm still living at home.

On top of all that I'm a good 150 pounds overweight. I tell myself everyday that ""today"" is the day to change, but I never do. 

I don't really have any kind of personal relationship with my parents, I don't feel like I can just talk to them because I feel like I'll just be judged. I also generally don't like people, because most of the people I've met in recent years are just all around douche bags who are incredibly prejudice. 

I just feel like everything is closing in around me before I have time to figure out what to do. I spend my nights and weekends alone, and I truly have ""no friends"".

d6v5y,depression,Electrofox,My best friend killed himself two days ago.,"He was only 23. I have never felt this much pain in my life. I've been crying for these two days continuously, not eating, not sleeping. It was so utterly unexpected. I don't know what to do with myself, when will the healing begin?


edit: I went over to his apartment, cleared his things out and gathered some personal effects. It was hard to deal with but I'm the only one who would go into the house and help his roommate, the one who found him dead, move everything out. It gave me a little bit of closure. 


I'm going to find professional help as soon as I can. I have really bad anxiety problems in life usually so at the moment, it has really been on long panic attack. I've probably slept a handful of hours and I've been trying. Thank you everybody for helping me out in here, I truly appreciate the time you took out of your lives to respond.

Each strand is sensitive to the vibrations of every other strand. Every vibration sings in not only the puppet's heart, but in the hearts of many other puppets, so that if you listen carefully, you can hear a low hum as of many hearts singing together."" - Jeff Vandermeer",15,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d6v5y/my_best_friend_killed_himself_two_days_ago/,1283093985
d6xub,depression,running_on_empty,I can talk better to random strangers than people I know...,"I just lost my future, I think. I've been with a girl for over two years. We met online, and because we live so far apart it's stayed online. But we're getting to that point in our lives where traveling across the country is possible and within our means.

But now she wants a break. We've had stretches of time where we haven't talked before, because one of us was too busy with school or we just pissed each other off. But not she wants to explore the feelings she has for someone else. Someone who lives close to her that she's been friends with for years.

When she sprang this on me I fought back until she chose me. It was a reflex and after thinking about it I told her to do it. Now we're both hanging by a thread. I can take it, I'm used to it, but  can't let her know how I feel because it might push her over the edge.

I've been dealing with depression or something like it for nearly half a decade now. Maybe longer. My family has a tiny inkling of it but I've hidden it so well sometimes I forget. But I always remember. She represented my future, and was always there even if I wasn't. Now I don't think she'll be there and I'm lost.

Forever and ever I've never considered suicide. For the first time ever it crossed my mind a few times, and seemed like a good option. But I don't really want to. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. I'm not artistic and my only outlet takes a lot out of me. Basically I'm a shell of a person that goes to work and comes back to sleep. I haven't even eaten today, and I don't feel hungry in the least.

The worst part is that she wants me to be her friend and I'm trying, but I'm not very good at it. I just don't know what to do.

EDIT - Guys thanks for the help. I am indeed feeling better. Hell just by eating for the first time in 24 hours my mood is soaring. I'm always amazed at how well I can fix myself up after being hurt so badly. It's taken almost a week to heal to the point where I'm not gonna cry in public (boy that would be embarrassing).

OK here we go I fuckin hate my life. I'm 19 and a virgin and have prolly around 5 friends all dudes. Never  had sex/kissed/held hands with a girl. I was already a goofy kid throughout elementary/middle school at the catholic school I went to and then in high school I realized I fuckin hated private school and went to a public high school. Except oops I had no idea how to interact socially! Private school kids are weird anyway and I was weird even for them. Not cute socially inept like Screech or whatever, like I wouldn't be surprised if people thought “Why is that autistic boy attending a normal school?”. Makin weird noises to be funny and stuff. 
	
My first semester of sophomore year I had no friends, the second one, I had one, who had transferred from the private school I went to freshman year. I wasn't even bullied, just sorta ignored. That entire year I sorta drifted through school life, talking to no one, at lunch I'd eat in the back of the library trying to avoid the library people because they didn't want people eating in there, I'd grab a random book off the shelves and just read. Imagine doing that once, then for a week/month/semester/entire school year. I'd go home at night, do my homework, and surf forums/chans cause that's where I knew people. All this while other people were hanging out with friends/having sex/ making mistakes and learning life lessons. My only solace was when maybe every other month my middle school friends all going to the same private school would be all like “Hey, we're doin something, wanna come along?” It's not like I was never given a chance, a couple times girls in class would ask “Why do you never talk?” sympathetically, but I had literally no idea how to respond other than mumbling “I've got nothing to say” or something. I had spent my entire adolescence online/playing video games/reading comics and had nothing outside of those things I knew how to talk talk about. Junior and senior years weren't that bad, eventually I found a couple other internet dorks and I ended up discovering media tech/film, and finished off high school with some friends. 

I had never gotten drunk/smoked weed until last year. I look back at my high school and feel like I wasted years of my life, and that compared to other people my age I'm immature because of my inexperience. Ever since maybe junior year I'd been helping out with a local film production company (everyone there 5-10 years my senior) and the summer before college I fell hard for a girl who crewed on one of their features. After bumbling my way through the summer awkwardly asking basically everyone for advice to the point that it became a joke I ended up asking her to “hang out” and we hung out  maybe twice before she went off to college. We are presently located back in the same town and I still occasionally facebook-stalk to see how she's been, and when she's on chat consider saying something but chicken out. My first semester of college I went to another town but ended up hating it/missing my city/flunking out/only making friends with the people in my dorm and even in the Honors Dorm with the other social retards I was the “weird one”.The next semester I came back home and I'm now going to community. I've made no friends at community college (suprise!!!) and most of my high school friends are gone for college. 

Today I spend most of my time lurking the internet and reading webcomics, I'd like to go out and socialize but none of my few friends are into that sort of thing, and if I don't already know anyone somewhere I won't talk. I want desperately to break out from where I am and I only realized this (sad as it may be) from the internet. I learned how other people are living their lives, dating and socializing and partying, about music and culture and how to not act like a huge spergy nerd. I've never been formally diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and I don't want to self-diagnose like a tool, but I've been helped massively by a lot of the resources out there for aspies and even things as simple as etiquette guides. I feel like over the past year I've grown massively w/r/t healthy ideas about social interaction/women/other humans/myself. I can actually do alright now talking to people about something other than mario! I still cringe like mad thinking about myself even from a year ago, things I said/did. Surprise surprise I've always had low self-esteem and trouble meeting people. I still don't know how dance or flirt. I know very few women and crave female companionship, feeling love from someone without a genetic obligation for once in my life would be a nice change of pace. I can start incidental conversation but that's it nothing comes of it. Make no mistake, I want dude friends too, maybe some non-nerd ones who'll just wanna go see a show downtown and then smoke out instead of playing tf2 until 10 and then everyone going home. At least a couple times a week I cry myself to sleep at 11 (Nothing better to do) squeezing my pillow pretending it's a woman, memories swirling through my head of every spergy thing I've done in my life and how much I wish I could have been born knowing how to talk to normal people like a normal person, and had had a normal healthy high school life. During especially painful periods I wish I never existed. 

I guess my life isn't so much bad as just empty. I've never told a soul about what I'm feeling; if you asked the people I know about me, they'd say I was nice and generally happy if a bit goofy or shy. I wouldn't know how to tell them about all these feeling I'm keepin inside or how they could even help. At the very least I want to hold a girl's hand sometime before turning 20. I want to have friends, but I don't have social experience, and I don't even know where or how to meet people. I want to like myself, but I haven't done anything with my life worth admiring. I want to have a life, and not just spend most non-school waking hours at home glued to the computer, sponging up my parents money because I don't have anyone or anything in my life.

d76us,depression,carryoncamping,Terrible experience last night,"Last night i went to bed very early as i felt incredibly depressed, i couldn't eat dinner and struggled to find the strength to even talk to my parents. In bed i thought for a number of hours about the stress related anxiety that i had been diagnosed with around Christmas and thought how most likely i had also been depressed for a long period of time as well. 

I came to the conclusion that it was either the depression causing the anxiety due to the fact that i have been continually putting on a front (to myself and others) that everything is ok. Or it may have been the frustrating and restrictive nature of the anxiety has led to depression.  

I felt relieved in a way, that i had recognised this and gotten some emotional release, i didnt feel anxious, as i was happy that i could begin to address the depression and move on and that this thin veneer of happiness that i had tried to maintain had fallen away. I lay thinking for a while longer until suddenly i was hit by a terrible panic attack which led to me feeling incredibly detached and panicked for 2-3 mins (very dark uncontrollable thoughts) followed by the physical symptoms (which lasted through till the early hours). After having this attack i have come to realise that i have had a couple of much more minor attacks in the past couple of weeks. 

This has left me feeling helpless today as I went from feeling good in a way that i was beginning to try and move on from this; to feeling helpless and terrible within a couple of hours. I feel incredibly low today and feel as though i cant go on (not suicidal, just exhausted in away from having to deal with this for so long) i also feel physically sick and am having trouble eating. 

I have an exam tomorrow and have to submit a 10,000 word dissertation by the end of the month. Both of these things are looking incredibly challenging to me. 

**Edit:** I am 20 and in the UK; I have not been drinking in order to control the problem. I have had trouble sleeping in the sense that I go to bed at 1-2 am and don't get out of bed till around midday. Perhaps adjusting my sleeping pattern may help?

I went to the doctor at Christmas and was referred to a councillor who told me to do breathing exercises and listen to stress relief tapes in order to try to reduce the anxiety. Feeling as I did then it was pretty tough to take this on and to try and implement it into my daily routine. However, I eventually got to a stage whereby I felt that I could control the anxiety (it did not go away completely). At this point the breathing exercises/tape listening phased out.

I am feeling pretty overwhelmed today and I am really just completly fed up of feeling anxious and trying to put on this false pretence to myself and others that I am ok when really I feel pretty awful.

d7auu,depression,Shinks7er,Severe OCD,"It started at 13 and got increasingly worse for years.  I'm 26 right now and I can't function the way I need to in order to maintain some semblance of a life.  I'm so mentally exhausted by the end of the day that I get bad headaches and experience other medical problems.  I feel utterly alone as I don't know a single person with OCD, let alone someone with the type I have.  I'm trying to work up the ambition to go to a OCD meeting but I'm afraid of being let down again.  There has been so many times where I've put all my hope into 1 treatment only to have my world shattered in the end.

I think about death a lot but I'm not planning on doing anything stupid.  I know if I died I'd be free of this crap, of everything!  I find it hard to express what I'm going through because it's such a vague obsession that response prevention is difficult.  People who wash their hands obsessively can pinpoint their problem and work on it.  The problem with me is EVERYTHING is the problem.  This OCD way of thinking is second nature after all these years. 

Example of a thought I might have: ""If I wear these socks I'll get a disease or someone will die or literally anything bad that pops into my head"".  It doesn't stop at clothing either, it's EVERYTHING.  Typing, reading, walking, breathing, etc...everything being fed through this OCD filter that is ingrained in my head.  Most of the time I can avoid succumbing to the compulsion but the obsessions and racing thoughts are always present.

The only drug that makes like a little less terrible is cannabis.  I smoke a lot because it helps.  I eat better, my thoughts aren't so troublesome, and it diminishes my anxiety to the point where it's hardly noticeable.  I'm done with this lousy attempt at describing my demons.  If anyone knows what I might be going through I'd love to hear from you.

But up close, there is no such line.  You know when you're well inside a cloud, and you know when you're well outside, but there's a lot of uncertainty in between.  A lack of certainty about exactly when you passed through the boundary.

The Pit is like that, too.  You may notice a downward slope to things, but you pay it no mind, because life is made of undulations.  If you're life is perfectly flat then so are your brain waves--you're dead.

You don't notice what you tripped over--or if there even was anything *to* trip over.  You don't feel a sense of falling, or hitting, or having been pushed.  You just suddenly notice that... fuck, you're in the Pit again.

You can look back and see hints and indications.  But then again, at other times you've seen those same things and nothing has come of it.  Even more frustrating, you can look back and see all the things you did *right*.  ""Dammit, I got my exercise.  Dammit, I took my meds.  Dammit, I really worked at having positive social interactions.  This isn't fair!""

But you know life isn't fair.  You're too old to think otherwise.  What's really bothering you is that you couldn't stop it.  You knew the Pit was lurking there, waiting, patient as death and just as merciless.  You did everything you could to stay out, you did everything that you've been told, you did everything they goddamn *promised* you would keep you out.

But there you fucking are.  In the Pit.  Alone, and cold, and tired... so tired.  You can't even keep up your anger at the injustice of it all.

It doesn't matter that there's no food in the Pit--you wouldn't eat it.  No light?  What's there to see?  No friends?  Who cares, I don't want to talk to anyone anyway.  I just want to lay down here on the floor and sink.  Dissolve.  Melt away like I had never been here in the first place.

Fuck you.  Fuck you and your goddamn guilt.  If you knew, if you knew what it was like you wouldn't give me goddamn shit about suicide.  Can't hurt you?  Fuck you.  Anchoring me to this bullshit existence.

It doesn't fucking matter.  None of it.  No matter what, I'm going to end up back here.  This Pit is my fucking grave.  I can climb out as many times as I want.  But I'll always end up back here.  The Pit will only ever be filled in while I'm still in it.  This, this is my existence.  This is me.  All that other stuff is just silly reindeer games.

You're never really alone in the Pit, you've got Eternity down there with you.  I don't really blame all you other people, up there, in the light, breathing the fresh air, dancing in the rain, and bathing in the sun.  It's not your fault that you don't understand.  You're just trying to be helpful when you wave to me, tell me to come and join you and Live.  You don't know that I can't.  That I'm not like you, I'm not really ever completely alive.  Some part of me is always down at the bottom of my grave, down in the cold darkness of the pit.

And when I reach too far into the light, the etheral cord that ties me back to the Pit gets tight, and stretched, until *SPOING* it snaps me back to where I belong.

Going from job to job was actually good for me i think, being new at a job people didn't really expect much from you and that felt great.
main reason i am going to go back to school is to stop working actually, its 15 hours away and i couldn't find a place to live so i signed up for the school housing which i think will depress me more when i see everyone else being 10 years younger than me.
I tried to find a place via Craigslist and other ads but i get really paranoid and think everyone is out to screw me, i tried to write a cheque to send to one guy but couldn't build enough courage to do it.
This is my last chance to get my life back on track, i dropped out of college in 2004 because i couldn't handle it.
sometimes i think i deserve it all, really what have i done that gives me the right to think that i am better than that homeless guy i saw yesterday, whats wrong with him and why shouldn't i be on the streets asking for change.

d7wqy,depression,ben4evah,Seeking help to seek help.,"First a little background: I'm a 24 year-old male, about to turn 25, that recently relocated to San Francisco from the Midwest. Over the past four or five years I have been on a steady slide into depression. I only deduced this last year, but had suspicions as far back as my sophomore year of college that something was going wrong in my head. 

I have had problems developing new relationships since my first year of college. At the time I just figured I had met my group of ""college friends"" and not really getting to know a lot of new people every year was just a product of going to a big school. But I'm convinced now that my main problem is the wall I build around myself to keep other people out. I have not had a girlfriend in nearly six years even though I have had many opportunities. I have met one person in the last five years I can confidently say I truly care for. Even then, this friend recently told me I am an incredibly negative influence in their life, and I see now that I've also been a negative influence in many others lives too, including my best friend. Around my parents and family I put on a front so they barely recognize how difficult it is for me be open and honest. 

I've always struggled with self-esteem and confidence issues which only exacerbate the problems I've had. I also self-medicate more than I should, either with marijuana or--less so these days, actually--booze. My self-esteem problems often lead to anxiety that I feel I need to drown in drugs. Any time I've tried to motivate myself to seek treatment something internal has held me back, and the cycle of negativity starts over again.

Basically I'm afraid I'm reaching a breaking point, and if I don't seek help soon I may permanently damage one or two of the only positive relationships I currently have. They have tried to help me also, but In my skewed sense I tend to resent them for it, which I just can't make sense of in my head, but it happens. I need to know what steps other Redditors took when seeking treatment. I want to see a doctor or professional but don't know where to begin looking, especially since I'm currently unemployed and have no insurance. 

I need your help guys. I used to think I was just a cynical type, but now I realize my lifestyle isn't healthy, and I worry about how much worse it will get if I don't do something soon.

I could say I've been depressed a long time, even when I when I think I should be happy, to be honest an aspect of me tells me I should, I'm privilage to not be in debt, I have a roof over my head, etc...

Current situation: Unemployed for over a year, no girlfriend, one true friend..

So I'm depressed about not having a job, a part of me wants to leave the country but I'm so shy and introverted, I'm worried to go on my own..

I'm also unhappy that for the past couple years because with those whom I call friends, they are all of course but, it's the fact that I can't truelly be their friends, because they are attracted to me too much... I can't make male friends... :(

This is the worst part though, I had sex with my best friends girl, it was over a year ago, of course I was absolutlely drunk, but it doesn't take the guilt away.

i don't think I'm looking for solutions, maybe just on advice on whether I should leave or not... even when I read back on what I said, it doesn't sound depressing as feels, ah well... 

I'm not asking anything to be honest, just say whatever..

I am going nowhere in life. 4 years of college and graduation still isn't in sight. I've gone from school to school. I can't sleep at night. I literally do not have any friends (my best friends do not answer/respond to my calls anymore). I'm in pain everyday and it is unbearable. My parents are becoming ever more frustrated because they are spending so much money (school, doctors, etc) and nothing is working.

I have tried my best to hold on. I've changed to a healthy diet, exercised, picked up new hobbies, etc. Nothing seems to work. I'm now more serious than ever about suicide. I really don't see any other option. If not suicide, I will simply live with my parents; depressed, angry, and in pain for the rest of my life. With no friends and not a whole lot of family, I really feel that I won't be too missed.

I've exhausted every possibility of recovering. I've tried my best and 5 years later I'm worse than ever. I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on what to do. Medication works at times but has serious drawbacks (kills all my motivation). Everyday I feel like I'm living a terrible nightmare... I am simply a burden to my family. I fear that I'm on the tipping point and am about to snap. I've already tried to kill myself once and failed. I took a bunch of clonezepam, and then drank/smoked weed until I passed out.

d837x,depression,[deleted],Make Love. ,"The nights are becoming cool again. I yearn for a telescope, to lose myself in the sky with. Where am I going? I feel like I am trapped on a raft in the middle of the ocean, with no land in sight. Cigarette, one after another, is this really where I belong? On this porch, with these crickets and tree frogs, with the sun? This sun, the way it peeks playfully through the banister, makes me wonder if it really is called a ""ballister"". The past half year replays in my mind, traveling further to two winters before it. An afternoon unexpected. A future unwinding before me, the very bark being whittled away. It began to shape itself, carving unexpected eyes, a proud nose and a twisting mouth into a face that I knew but didn't. The fatal moment grew nearer, and I didn't know. The snow plunged toward Earth in a desperate attempt to avoid the crushing metal, and a single green leaf suddenly sprouted on the tree outside my bedroom window. I was born again. A new breath, a new beginning sprung forth from the leaf and into my world. Music fills my ears as I sit hopeful, and willing, in a place unbenknownst. ""Days go by, and still, I think of you.""

Winter will soon come. The blanket of warmth and the glistening sweat will soon dry, crack and bleed. Time will persist, rear its ugly head and force me further into its grasp. Books and bindings will surround my new and unwanted room of unspent wishes. Dreams of French blue walls and gripping, lusting hands will haunt my nights. 

Laughter, friendship and absolute serenity are no longer the ground I stand upon. That warm embrace, his soothing kiss and my hopeful heart died along with the mosaic memories that have shattered before me. 

Nights filled with passion and uninhibited happiness have become nights filled with sorrow and deeply burning devastation. His hands betrayed me. His heart forgot me. His eyes penetrated me and stole from me the happiness that I had found for the first time in my life. I've lost it. The nights are becoming cool again.

d8fr1,depression,desperatethrowaway,"My girlfriend is horribly depressed, and I'm at my wits end. ","Hello. I've created this username simply for this post... I post on reddit on a pretty regular basis using another name, but I'd like to stay (somewhat) anonymous in this case. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for nearly a year now, and when I started our relationship, I was aware of what I was getting into. She had mentioned in the past a history of depression, and even attempted suicide in high school. We are both in college (she's a senior, I'm a junior) and we recently returned four the fall semester. Although we have only been here three days, every night she winds up crying herself to sleep, and there seems to be nothing I can do. I stay up for the majority of the night trying to console her, but there's a wall between me and her that cannot be reasoned. We both love eachother, but her depression is seriously ripping this relationship to shreds. 

I nearly broke up with her over the summer - she lives a few towns over, and every night it would be the same thing. She would call, and cry continuously. I would even travel in the middle of the night to her house, only to be told she didn't want to see me. She seems to dislike any affection - her self loathing is so intense that she feels she doesn't deserve to be loved. I know she does, and I do love her, but I do not think I can do this anymore myself. She pushes me away, and try as I might, I can't get over the fact that I feel unwanted. I'm young, and I don't want to waste any more of my life being unhappy. I don't mean to say my girlfriend is a waste of time, but I constantly wonder why I burden myself with this relationship when I get nothing but grief. 

I have a history of depression myself. My father passed away my first semester of college; I was away from home, and the only person in my life I felt I truly related to was gone. At the same time, due to his death I was left without health insurance. I suffer from Crohn's disease and chronic ulcerative colitis and must be heavily medicated; with no way to pay for this, I became very sick myself. I was all alone in a strange place, and yet I continued on with school knowing that my father would have been disappointed if I gave up. I know what depression feels like, and I would never wish it upon my worst enemies. But everyone's depression is different - while I can find the source of mine, hers is something less defined and visceral, something strange and undetectable. Though I think I can relate, I really cannot. 

Her issues may stem from her family. Her father is a horribly greedy man who, though quite wealthy, fails to provide for her. Her mother is incredibly judgmental, and forces her and her sisters to compete at just about everything, including looks. She feels inferior at just about everything. 

Today is just the final cut for me. I can't do it anymore. I love her, but I need to recognize my happiness too. She refuses to get help, and simply wants to wallow. I don't know how to ease her into the arms of someone more capable of helping her. I wish I could do something, but all I can do is be there. I would feel horrible to just leave her behind, but there's a point where my own livelihood is being threatened by her depression. I feel awful, and selfish, and insufficient as a lover. But something needs to change in my life before something truly bad happens. I can't deal with another death in my life, and I fear that any drastic action may point her in that direction. 

If anyone has anything to say that will help, I would be incredibly grateful.

d8h9e,depression,Rambis,"How do you handle people who believe depression can be ""thought away""?","One of my best friends constantly posts articles on her FB profile about how depression is a result of negative thinking and getting a good/better job, exercising and thinking positively will make the depression disappear. I get that those things *can* help some people, at least in the short term, but I do not believe that clinical depression/bpd/etc. can be cured by doing so.   

We've talked about it and I've tried explaining to her that actual diagnosed depression isn't a mood to be changed. She says she understands b/c she claims she was depressed in college. I'm not sure I believe she was actually depressed b/c of her views on depression. To my knowledge, she wasn't diagnosed with a mood disorder either.   

All I can do anymore besides try to talk to her about it is post articles about depression on my FB page as well. She responds very well to scientific studies and citations, so that's what I post. She reads them so I know they have a purpose, but it doesn't really get us anywhere.  

I know this will likely be a lifelong disagreement b/w us but I can't help but feel that she's singling me out when she posts that stuff on her page. We speak about the topic on almost a daily basis and I've never seen a conversation on her page about it b/w her and anyone else.  

It doesn't hurt my feelings that she does it because she's not coming from a malicious place, but it's very frustrating, especially since she's so scientifically minded.    

I know there's nothing I can really do change her mind on the subject, it's like arguing religion. I was just wondering how other people deal with friends and family who think depression can be dealt with by ""looking on the bright side"". What do you say to them? If there's nothing you *can* say, how do you brush it off and let it go?  

Thank you in advance and any advice is appreciated.   

**EDIT:** I spoke to her this morning and we agreed that we'd drop it. She also mentioned that her posts are more directed to people who are 'sad' and not necessarily those with clinical depression, even though she still believes it's possible in some of those cases.   

Thank you all for your great advice! I knew I came to the right place. A huge thank you to *all people* (minus the trolls) that post in this sub and others like it (suicidewatch, diagnosed, bipolarreddit).

d8ik8,depression,damn_it_so_much,So crazy it just might work: the goals thread.,"So I'm realizing that after I got laid off a few weeks ago, all I've really been doing is sit alone in my apartment on Reddit.  When I really should be working my ass off looking for work.  I'm just basically avoiding everything in life (fear, anxiety, lethargy, depression, what have you).  I've been in this place a whole bunch of times in the past, and it doesn't help *at all*.

So I need to break out of my rut.  Problem is, Reddit is so seductive.  And I often have little willpower (or concept of time) when I'm alone and sulking and basically trapped within myself.  And when I think about the enormity of everything I need to do right now, I kind of mentally shut down.  I have great difficulty getting anything done in this mindset.  And, surprise surprise, *nothing* has been getting done!!!

The idea: I want to post stuff here that I need/want to get done, so that everyone here can see it.  This way (in a silly artificial sense) my promises to myself to do shit has *meaning*.  And then I can report back and say if I fucked up and blew it all off, did some of what I wanted to accomplish, or did everything like a fucken badass.  I figure I don't have anything to lose cause so far I didn't accomplish jack shit :P

But I am not an egotist nor am I selfish (at the moment).  I don't think I'm the only person who is like this.  So, I present to r/depression the goals thread.  This way, if you all want, you can post your own goals in here for Reddit to see, and create your own artificial motivation!  If you don't update when you say you will, I can even volunteer my time to bug you about it orangered style.

The kinds of goals I'm looking for are the small-step concrete ones.  So rather than ""I will get a job,"" which is fucking hard and easily prone to perceived failure, try ""I will revise my resume before 3pm"" or ""I will apply for 3 jobs today.""  And time limits are important.  I know I'm a terrible procrastinator.

I don't know if this idea will be an awesome success or a staggering failure, but frankly I'm kinda pissed off with my own inaction and I want to do something about it.  And maybe I'm not alone in feeling this.  It's my hope that we can all move beyond empathy for each other's situations, concretely help each other, and maybe even improve our lives a little.

(I've always liked the character of Cameron.) EDIT: Darn, I messed up my quotation marks...please no grammar naziing?

I posted here about a month ago, made a lot of excuses, and then just stopped answering comments.

I was talking about wanting to do unhealthy things. I didn't start smoking, but I have been drinking more nights than I haven't (rarely more than one drink at which point I get bored with it, though, so that hardly counts), I did ""hook up"" with a friend of mine several times who is even less interested in being in a relationship than I am, so the only person I was hurting was me; I've started burning myself again.

Well tonight I've been wallowing for a couple of hours, and about 30 minutes ago I went ahead and burned myself. At first I felt euphoric, but a few minutes later I realized that there was no acceptable ""step up."" That was the highest level of self-destruction that I could allow, which begged the question of what I would be able to do if I felt worse later. That was upsetting for 10-15 minutes until I came out of my room and back downstairs where I should have been to begin with, since I know that burning myself isn't going to accomplish anything and if I'm sitting in my bedroom depressed and not going to sleep that's what's going to happen.

I used to think I had a support structure so that I could talk about these things if things were rough. But I talked to a friend in June only to find out that I don't have the support structure that I thought I had, and in fact it is a very dangerous thing to admit these feelings to people. Suddenly people want to fight with you, and control you, which is the very reason that I'm reluctant to talk to people, or seek a professional who has even more power over you. (I would be going to university people, so they can get my address, my phone, my roommate's name, my family's contacts, etc. They could hurt the people I care about and have shielded from this, they could embarrass me by telling my friends, they could bring out the police. They threatened my roommate with police intervention when she started therapy (I don't actually know why) so there's no reason to believe they wouldn't do the same to me if I'm actually honest. They could decide I'm a risk and that therefore I shouldn't have any say in things. And if I lie, why bother going?)

If I always *wanted* to take care of myself, I think I'd be fine. But sometimes, I just don't, and I don't have anyone who can help me do the right things in spite of me. And now I'm feeling myself get worse about it, which is to say that I'm abstracting my feelings away from the root problems so that I have no hope of talking myself out of a bad feeling because I'm not going to know what the problem is. 

I've got to find a way to cut this out, because I just can't afford to do this while I have so much to do with school. I don't even care if it's not permanent, because I tried very hard for a few years to have some sort of stable mood with healthy coping mechanisms only to backslide now. I don't remember a time when my moods were consistently ""normal"" so there's no reason to believe they're going to be, I just need to halt my destructive feelings so I can be as successful with school as I can be.",1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d90kw/then_i_sort_of_watched_myself_from_inside_i/,1283489380

d9d74,depression,lethargisch,I don't know how much longer I can last.,"I've never been clinically diagnosed, but I'm sure that I have depression and low self-esteem.  I don't remember a time when I didn't have those things.  I pretend, for everyone else's sakes, that I'm fine.  I smile, laugh, make jokes, talk about my future.  But I'm not ok.  I know I don't have a future.  I used to think I could get a job somewhere, doing something, anything.  But now... everyone's going to know I'm not good enough.  What happens when they all find out that I'm worthless, and I know it?  The only thing stopping them from treating me like I should be treated is the entertainment value.  How amusing it must be, to watch someone so hopeless struggle to be good enough, to act like they're human.

Ever since I was little I knew.  I used to go play in the rain and sing songs to myself about how I wished I could be anyone but me.  Even as young as 12 years old I thought about suicide.  But I realized I was too cowardly to go through with it.  I know that I should, since I'm only a mockery of humanity, and a waste of resources, but I'm too much of a coward.

I just wish I could apologize.  Mostly to my parents.  I'm sorry that I had to be me, that I turned out like this.  If only you had waited a little while, I wouldn't be me.  You could have had somebody else.  A real person.  But I can't apologize, I can't.  Then everyone will know that I know, and then the game will be over.  They won't have to pretend to like me, to tolerate me.  I won't be entertaining anymore, and they'll ship me off somewhere or put me underground or send me to another dimension.

Sometimes I hear things.  Just a word, or a loud sigh.  But I'm alone when I hear it.  Or sometimes I see something move out of the corner of my eye.  Something moves or disappears.  You know that little voice in your head, that you talk to yourself with?  I have more than one.  There are too many things true and not true in my head, I don't know what to think anymore.  Maybe I'm making it all up.  Maybe it's a dream.  In my dreams, I'm never myself.  Maybe I'll wake up and be normal, and the world will be good.  Or maybe tomorrow I won't wake up at all.

Every single night when I go to sleep, I hope that I don't wake up the next day.  That's the only way out of this game.  I can't talk to a psychologist, because everyone will know.  I can't end it myself because I'm a coward.  What can I do?",13,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d9d74/i_dont_know_how_much_longer_i_can_last/,1283557335

d9n3h,depression,[deleted],I showered.  I called my mom.  I went outside.  Today is a good day :).,"This week has been a week that I started spiraling downwards.  I was given an assignment at work that I spent most of 4 days straight doing- only sleeping 2-3 hours each morning to refresh.  My mom had major surgery Monday, I didn't even call her the night before to talk to her.  I did text my dad/sister to check on her though.  I didn't leave the house to take the kids to/from school- my husband did that.  

I got the project done, emailed it in then walked to bed and slept for a few hours.  Got back up and started in on my regular work which was behind because of the project.  Just felt like I couldn't catch up.  Felt lower than low because I still hadn't called my mom.  Text messages from friends were irritating me, I just didn't want to answer them or talk to anyone- just wanted everyone to go away and leave me alone.

Last night my husband encouraged me to take some of my xanax and the pressure started coming off a little bit.  He had to go pick our son up after the high school football game and encouraged me to go with him.  I bitched about it but I went- and even went to the store with them afterwards.

Today I woke up, took my meds and relaxed for a few.  Went and took a shower and put real clothes on (not a new set of pajamas).  Called my mom who is still in the hospital and talked to her for an hour.  Decided I'd take my rambunctious puppy to the dog park for the first time to see how she liked it.  Not only did she love it, she's exhausted and I enjoyed the sun, being around other people and watching everything go on around me.

Today I feel normal again.  I don't feel the need to avoid anyone or get irritated at the thought of leaving the house.  I'm interacting with my family more.  Today is a good day and I'm happy for that.  Living with depression and anxiety sucks ass a lot of the time but I'll try to focus on the good days.

d9nqs,depression,stressedoutsexlife,I'm growing tired of my life...,"I'll try to keep this concise and to the point. 

I'm 21, male, studying my last year for my mathematics degree and will (god help me) be going to grad school next year. 

I live in a small town and go to a small school. The county's U3 unemployment is roughly the same as the nation's U6 unemployment. 

I can't find a job to save my life. Restaurants only want to hire females because they bring in more customers. Delivery places only want to hire townies, because their schedules are very flexible. The few stores here don't want to hire full time students who don't have a large amount of availability. 

My university has largely gotten ride of student employment positions outside of Work-Study students. 

I basically live off of my student loans. I get almost no help from my family, except some money from my grandparents for books. 

Because I want to go to grad school, I have to spend hundreds of dollars on the GRE and grad school applications which will leave me mostly dry as far as money goes once bills and rent are paid. 

I'm a very good student, but I have no confidence in myself when I compare myself to those who went to big name schools. 

I've been diagnosed with depression, and spent a year messing with various SSRI's, but those did a whole lot of jack and shit. I also spent a few days in a psych ward for help, which did a bit but nothing worthwhile. My university has free counseling, but the number of visits is very limited. 

My insurance sucks, so even if I went back on SSRI's I don't have the money to pay for it. My parents don't believe in depression, so I have no support there other than the occasional joke at my expense or a ""change your fucking attitude."" 

I very rarely have energy. I force myself to exercise several times a week and I eat right but doesn't help the depression nor the energy problem. 

I want to eat better and lose some weight, but I can't cut my carbs any more without passing out. 

I have no support from anyone in my grad school pursuit because all they focus on is how much money I will be making at that point in time. 

My family is nothing but alcoholics whose favorite past time is pointing out how pathetic I am despite my high gpa, my major, and my other accomplishments. In the mean time my sister who's an English teacher and got knocked up a year after graduating college is the greatest person ever born. 

I can't sleep most of the time, and when I do I might as well have not slept. I am stressed out 24/7. I have no idea how to manage either of this, but I have been to a doctor about the insomnia who only gave me the advice of exercising (which I already do), and not taking OTC sleeping pills which WERE the only thing that let me sleep (sadly they no longer are effective). 

For the most part, I just want to sleep my life away. I'm sick of everything about it. I have never known more than fleeting moments of happiness and almost constant depression and emptiness. To be perfectly honest, if someone would just fund my life long enough for me to get my PhD and then kill me I'd be fine with that. There is really not aspect of life that I find endearing enough to warrant another several decades of misery. 

I want to move away from everyone I know. Go to the other side of the country/continent/world and meet new people who don't know me and won't make a game out of my hell.

I'm a 23 year old male, earlier this year I moved back in with my parents because of money issues.  Since than I've been feeling more and more depressed every day.  I don't really have any direction in life, and I have only one friend who lives in another state.  I told her I was depressed earlier today and I still haven't gotten a response back.

But to get to the point, here is a recap of tonight's event's.  I'm at my parent's house on reddit and I decide to go for a walk, I start walking and I start to think about my life and everything I've done since high school.  It all boils down to I have one friend (I never learned how to make friends), I'm just plain tired of my life, and I barely make enough to pay all of my bills.  I feel no enjoyment anymore.  While I was walking around my neighborhood 4 trains went by and each time I just thought ""What would happen? Would anybody miss me?""  but each time I was to far away to even try anything.

To compensate I enter dates, appointments, phone numbers, and anything else that seems important into my smart-phone. It doesn't always work, but it helps.

Likewise, when I take notes for class I type my notes on a computer and write out as much of what the teacher is saying as is humanly possible. I know that I won't remember many of the details later, so having very detailed notes helps. 

When I need to get out of the house and do something important I try to dress up kind of fancy, like putting on a shirt, tie, and jacket. To me it's like putting on armor. I know people will just see the jacket and tie and not the crazed, disheveled soul wearing it. That way I can sort of hide from their eyes until I do whatever I need to do, then go home and have a nice panic attack for the rest of the evening. 

Rice cooker. Oh my god Rice Cooker. You wash your rice, put it in the cooker, put some water in, chop up some broccoli and put it into the steamer tray, and half an hour later you have real, hot food. It's great when I'm lacking the energy to shower or do much of anything else. Similarly, hot sandwhiches in a toaster oven. Hot ham and cheese isn't quite the same as happiness, but sometimes it's an acceptable substitute.

I just made this. I am here among strangers asking for help. Fine. I'm the stranger. But he's the one who needs your help. He is one among you and has many friends here. Imagine the irony. Me. Here. Asking for help for him from you. But I know there are many among you with a kind heart and there is a lot of wisdom among the 'collective you'. Time and again my roommate has send me links to comments over the course of last two years and has urged me many times to become a Redditor and has asked me to give my opinions and comments here,and I have declined or was simply busy. Ah. There is a first time. Sorry if I am not familiar with your rules.

Let's get to the point. I am seriously worried for him. I am afraid he may harm himself too. You see, I am only an accountant. He's the highly educated super brilliant engineer. He even has an M.S. degree in electrical engineering and his bookshelves are full of books. He was doing his research until state pulled his funding. I am also a track athlete, and I am on the addidas team. My roommate lives with me and my girlfriend, and my two little 7 and 8 year old nieces. He's a great guy, kind, soft spoken, considerate, very down to earth, easy going and honestly quite simple despite being a gifted engineer. He hardly has anything material besides few clothes, his computers and lots and lots of books.

Ok. So here's the problem. He just lies down in his bed all day everyday. He hardly talks, hardly moves, is always sad, has a heart breaking look of gloom on his face as if he has cancer, he always nods yes or no to most questions, and doesn't speak or join conversion at all. He hardly eats too. My girl friend went to college with him where he went to grad school. They were both in the college track team and that's how I have met him. 3yrs ago. And he's a good one too. Runs good and is in great shape. We all did a marathon about 3months ago. She still goes to college for her teachers credentials and is on the college track team. We all used to run together, practice together every single day. But he doesn't anymore. It's two months if not three he's been this way. There are never anymore answers from him. I know he takes medication for his depression from his college days. As far as we know, he doesn't have anybody. He was orphaned since a child and had a rough upbringing, but grew up to be such a good trooper and had his shit together. He had only us, some friends and well, his research was everything, but that was over about 9months ago. He doesn't work, and we don't know how he pays rent, but I assume he has saved money. He's always mindful of such things. He's always been honest, funny, beaming, full of spirit and cheerful. I found Zoloft, Celexa and something else in our medicine cabinet in the bathroom, and he's taking them. Even my little nieces are quiet around him and have started asking questions what's wrong with him. My little nieces, my sisters kids stay with me because my sister is a waste of oxygen. Atleast here, I could take care of them and feed them and take them to school. Coming here and asking you was my girlfriends idea. Both me and my girlfriend has tried to talk to him many many times and had even confronted him together, pushed him out of the bed to go running, tried to engage him, take him out, but he's always distant in thought and is never really with us even when we are together. Wierd of all, he doesn't even use his computer as he always always used to. This Saturday we found bloodstains in the bathroom floor and I noticed lacerations and cuts on and around his neck. And few big bandages and a bloodstained t-shirt. When asked he said he cut himself shaving, but those cuts seem too big and deep for shaving to me. I don't think its a razor. He's never been a good liar and his face gives him away. My girlfriend watches him closely, he hardly even moves for hours from the same position for hours at a time. He's as if he's completely paralyzed. I work and I have to practice twice e everyday, morning and evening, and she goes to school. The kids have school too. We are not home during the course of the day until 4, but we worry a LOT for him. We have removed all sharp objects from the kitchen and garage. We are a bit scared of him now at what he might do next. We want his old self back. He's obviously really hurting over something and simply won't tell anybody. We worry if he may harm himself. He's very talented, is brilliant and a nice guy. I care for him like my own brother. I have urged and pushed him to see a doctor or a therapist so many times over the last few months, even called and fixed appointments for him. He won't go. I have no clue what to do anymore. He's 27, I'm 25 and my girlfriend is 23. 

Reddit? Will you help us? 

Me and my girlfriend are totally out of options. I cannot ask him to move out. That Is totally out of question. He has no one else and no where else to go. Besides this was originally his place. And the rest of us slowly moved in and joined his lease. Like I said, he's a great loving, adjusting and accommodating guy. There are kids toys and clothes all over the place and he has not even once complained. Never. We all together take care of my nieces, cook for them, feed them and wash their clothes, and tend to their needs as our own kids. He's like family. We just simply don't know him this way in the last 3yrs. We don't know what's hurting him. Yes, he was sad for dropping his PhD but that was a good decision, and not getting hired at few interviews he had, but not suicidally depressed as he is now. We love him and really do care.

dadkk,depression,tells,Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,"So I'm submitting this to you guys because what has helped me the most is what this man, Albert Ellis, had written down.  I figured most of this stuff out on my own but reading his works, I knew that, for me at least, it was the way my mind should work and cope with things.  

Albert describes his ABC model for REBT as such:  A (action or event) leads to B (belief) which leads to C (consequence).  Duh, right?  Well he also believed that always questioning our ""B"" to find the best ""B"" was the only way to successfully deal with life.  He believed that we **are able** to change our ""B"" and to have an incident not hurt us so badly.  Whether it be a person being mean to us, an object reminding us of something bad, etc. it could all change. 

For those that have listened to motivational speakers like Tony Robbins might see many similarities.  However, Albert isn't endorsing a chest-bumping high motivational outcome.  He's endorsing a logical frame of mind that is at peace with itself.  

If you want to know more, I suggest you get some of his books at your local library or for cheap at the Amazon.com used bookstore.  He writes for the layman and with a very conversational tone.  I highly recommend it.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dadkk/rational_emotive_behavior_therapy/,1283816877
dae68,depression,Low-battery,"Broke, lonely and unmotivated. How can I get out of my rut?","I'm 24, male, broke as hell and feel like I'm alone and basically broken. I graduated from college two years ago, hoping to go to grad school, but after graduation I was so burnt out I decided I wanted to take a year off. Well, one year turned to two years and I started trying to study for the GRE and research schools, but I just wasn't motivated. Not to mention that my circle of friends shrank almost immediately after graduation as my friends all either moved home or left to travel or moved for work or grad school.

During this time I was working 36 hours a week at a job that I used to really love and was great during school, but now I've worked there for so long that I'm starting to get stagnant and bored. Not to mention the business is not doing well and is starting to go under. No one knows how much longer we'll be able to stay open (it is a small neighborhood supported store that the neighborhood has seemed to abandon), plus since we all know how bad the situation is no one is ever in a good mood. Recently I reduced my hours so that I could start working at a second job at a restaurant. I was hoping the extra tip money would solve my financial situation (I was making just enough money to pay rent and buy groceries, I had to borrow from my roommate to pay the utilities a couple times). I was also hoping the new work environment would help me meet people and make some friends. 

It hasn't. The new job doesn't need me more than one or two days a week, and I often get cut early after only a couple hours. My hours at my other job have already been given to other employees so now I'm making even less money working two jobs than I was working just the one. And now I just hate both jobs. 

I recently admitted to myself that I probably have depression. Of course, I'm too broke to go see a doctor about it (at least until I can get back on my dad's insurance at the end of the month). I find that I just can't leave my house unless I have work. All of my closest friends, the people that I miss the most, all live in cities I'd have to fly to now. None of the people left in this city feel like friends. They all have their own groups of friends; none of them know each other, so I just float between everyone else's groups of friends feeling like a I don't belong with any of them. When I call or text people I just get ignored, and no one ever calls or texts me to see what I'm doing or if I'd like to join them anywhere. Three people came to my birthday this year, which was three more than last year, I guess. I haven't had a girlfriend in YEARS and feel like I can't even talk to women without making an ass of myself, and on the few occasions I've gotten a woman to come home with recently I haven't been able to preform in the bedroom, I just feel dead down there unless I'm masturbating. 

Sometimes I want to just pack the basics and skip town and start new somewhere, but then I think that isolating myself even more can't be healthy, and on top of that I don't have the money necessary for such a move. Although it seems all I do these days is isolate myself in my house. It was a beautiful day outside today, but I just couldn't get motivated to go outside. I just sat in bed and played video games on my phone and surfed the web. I used to love to cook, but now I just eat out because I'm lazy. When I ate that is. I've lost my appetite. My stomach is grumbling as I type this, but I just don't feel like eating. My sleep schedule is destroyed. Sometimes I don't go to sleep until 5am. I often wake up around 10-12 regardless of when I went to bed the night before. My memory is fucked. I can't remember things seconds after I hear them sometimes. Or plots of TV Shows or movies or food that I ate the next day. It's awful, I feel like an idiot. And I now have crippling social anxiety. I feel like nothing I have to say is worth saying because I live such an uninteresting life, what could I possibly have to add to any conversation. And lastly I've been self-medicating. I never used to drink or smoke too much, I was really good at being responsible with alcohol and marijuana, but I've been smoking a lot of pot recently, even though I know it bums me out, I just hope that it'll make the show I'm watching funnier or the food I'm eating taste better. Then on the few nights I do go out with friends I drink too much because I feel like it's the only way I'm capable of interacting with people. 

I want to fix this but I don't know what to do. I know I should be exercising. I'm not overweight but I have no muscle tone or stamina. Of course I can't get motivated enough to start an exercise routine. It seems like everything I want to do costs money I don't have, and I can't seem to find a job that will actually pay me. I'd love to join a gym, or see a therapist or get medication but I can't afford it and it drives me fucking nuts. I feel like I'm stuck in this pit and I can't get out.

I no longer believe there are good, honest people out there. People only lie, cheat, steal, and use you for their own advantage. The worst part about this is everything seems completely out of my control. I know people with depression are often told to change themselves, but it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.

People regularly steal from me, ignore me, and lie to me. It's turned me very cynical and I've stopped reaching out to people because I know I'll just get burned. I feel like I can't get anything done anymore because the nature of others will prevent it.

Does anyone have advice?",28,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/daqhh/ive_lost_faith_in_people/,1283885864
dauen,depression,brokenn,I'm slipping again.,"I'm not brushing my teeth like I should and I'm not showering until like 2 or 3pm instead of first thing. I don't leave the house unless I have to and I only go to class or work. I think about how I should shave my legs when I shower but then I don't bother. My room is a huge mess.

I don't enjoy my degree but I'm working my way through it since I'm being pressured to by my parents. I don't really have any hobbies and I feel like I should do something but I don't have any motivation to. I don't like being in social situations because I'm so socially awkward it's pathetic and all I can think about is how other people must be judging me for my looks or how I'm acting or what I'm saying.

Life sort of seems really pointless I guess. I'm scheduled to graduate at the end of this year and what then? Get a job I hate as much as what I'm studying? Go to work every day and then just come home and sit on the internet?

What are people supposed to look forward to in life?

It's strange though, that I can recognize all this stuff that's wrong with me but I still don't do anything about it. I feel like I should go back to my doctor and tell him the meds don't seem to be working but I can't be bothered. I feel like I should talk to a therapist or someone who can fix me but I know that I'll never do that.

I get some small pleasure out of working, but nothing approaching actual joy.

I can't talk to my family about this because a) it will depress them, and b) they are all religious and I am not, so I would expect them to just tell me to get religion.  I've tried talking to my friends, but they just end up mocking me, laughing at my expense, so I've stopped doing so.  Hence, I have nobody to talk to about this.

I see happy couples all around me, and it seems that most of the women I run into are wearing rings, so that just adds to my frustration and depression.  I think that if I found the right woman, she would be a strong motivator for me to live my life more fully.  Also, I think about if I get seriously ill or in an accident, nobody will be by my side.  When I was young my goal was to get married and be a father, but with each passing day that goal grows less and less achievable.

Before I punch out I may seek professional help.  After all, I figure the worst that could happen is confirmation that I'm only ever going to be sad and lonely and I may as well just end it.

dbt78,depression,pissysissy,I cannot take anymore hurt. I don't know what to do.,"I will try to make this as short as possible.

My Mother passed 5 years ago and that was the first time I was treated by a psychiatrist. The depression has been controlled pretty well and I've only had 1 or 2 really bad times that lasted about a couple of weeks. 

I have been so depressed in the past 2 days than ever in my life. I lost my uncle who was like a father to me because my dad was no where to be seen. He suffered from cancer, like my Mother and we watched him die, like her, a long, painful struggle. That same weekend that he passed, my cat Catheryn, who was 19 years old passed. I raised her from 1 day old, fed her with a bottle, she was like a baby for weeks and then she finally thrived for 19 happy years. Well, previously this year I lost my 16 year old cat to stomach cancer so I was still sore from that.

Well, 2 weeks later my dog who was a 14 year old pug died due to intestinal bleeding. He was having problems but we controlled it with diet then he just went down hill in the matter of 2 days.

During all of this I have been sick as well. I have MS and I have had H1N1 which turned into pneumonia. I have almost died twice since March 2010. I have been working sporadically for the past 5 weeks as the toll on my body has been rough. I had a hip replacement last year and I was really just getting to feel really back to myself. My employer is really good with me but I need money now because I chose leave without pay as I was tapped out from the hip replacement anyhow.

This is what is putting me over the edge. Before my uncle died, his old Labrador passed so I got him a kitten. He got so sick after the dog died that he was put in Hospice and I kept the kitten. We named him Meaty. Well, I took Meaty to be neutered Tuesday and they call about 11:00 and say that he stopped breathing and that I needed to take him to my family vet. They give Meaty fluids all day and then I take him home for the evening until they open in the morning or I could have taken him to the hospital but I chose to bring him home as I could see that he was not going to get better. My husband slept on the couch and we laid puppy pads all over the bed and let Meaty lay on me all night. I just pet him all night and then in the morning I called my vet and she said that it was time and I had him put down. He was in heart failure and I could not watch him suffer. 

I cannot quit crying. This happened yesterday and I went to work today feeling like shit because I could not stay at home and think about this all day. I feel empty. I loved that kitten so much. How is someone supposed to carry all of this with grace?

I'm pissed that things that I love have died. No one deserves to suffer like what I've seen with my Mother, Uncle, Simon and Meaty. My heart is broken. Why would a god let anything so innocent suffer? How could a god let my Mom and Unck suffer like they did? They both went to church every time the doors were open. I don't understand and I don't know what to feel or if I can anymore.

Obvious throwaway is obvious.
I am graduating law school in December and trying to take the Oregon State Bar in February. I live in Portland, Oregon. I lost my health insurance since I am no longer in school and so I can no longer afford Lexapro.

I am terribly depressed because I cannot find any work. I am now homeless which is making things even worse. No law firms are hiring and no one else will hire me because they don't understand why I am not working in a law firm. 

I cannot erase the last three years of my life and I won't lie to create a new resume.

I am desperate and I don't know what to do any more. Portland Oregon is never a good place to try and get a job but right now it seems worse than ever. I guess I just wanted to post because I don't have many people I can talk to and I am sure that my friends are tired of hearing about my troubles.

I have food stamps which is saving my life.

I am in the best shape of my life because I have all the time in the world to jog and I eat very well. I am trying to modulate my mood as much as possible but not being able to pay my bills is killing me.

dc94s,depression,marhaysu,I've been feeling down periodically with increasing frequency for about a year. Is that a problem?,"If you can spare the time, I'd like to complain a bit. I feel like I need help.

For some time now, I've been feeling down periodically. I think it got to the current level about half a year ago, but the frequency has increased, so my mood is less stable now.

It feels like that oscillation is around some drastic collapse. I really would like some way to evade this breakdown. 
The worst days are when I fantasize (in a pretty self-indulgent way, imagining all the drama) about suicide (my favourite way: falling decapitation). Of course, that way of thinking about suicide might well mean that I don't actually want it, that I actually just want to be coddled and get some attention, but these are problems in themselves.

I'm really looking for ways to get out of this. Is this real depression, or am I just a crybaby? Do I need to find out what's causing it first, or is there a depression override switch? (I have some ideas, please ask if you'd like to know them.) Is it good for me to whine about my problems? There are two factors I can think of; first, maybe I need some sense of self-worth to feel happy, making it good; second, maybe I need to lower my reliance on others to keep up my self-worth, making it bad in the long term.

Sorry if the post was a bit incoherent. I'm confused by my moods, which is why this may all seem like I'm going through the teen-age, but I'm a bit too old for that now. Is there a requirement for healthy development that, when unfulfilled, can cause this?

Im a 27/m who throughout life struggled with depression.  I have worked with various therapists, taken various medications, and generally feel that my experience with therapists was hampered by lack of trust and insecurity of my thoughts.  I have self-injured, unsuccessfully achieved mediocre fails in suicide attempts, abused alcohol and pot, but felt like this was all passing by.

I remember a marked 'interest' in the past of suicidal thoughts involving vehicles.  Arguably, more than thoughts (two of my suicide 'attempts' involved totaling low end American vehicles).  It scared the shit out of me.  The thoughts.  The actual actions (that I almost felt like weren't my actions to own).

Regardless--

I've felt clean of these thoughts for a year +/-.  I thought all was behind me, and I just needed to keep a positive attitude and a chin up to life.

Recently I have found these thoughts (not while driving yet) returning.     It honestly scares me.  I felt like this was a period that I finally overcame... I am (by most metrics) successful, make good money, have a supportive S.O., but -- alas -- I find these visualizations of vehicular suicide returning.

So far they have mostly been after social drinking, or (not drinking) a night while trying to sleep.  I feel like i've 'been here' before, and this slowly progresses to a place where they occur while ACTUALLY driving.

Well anyway, I've been fairly miserable for a couple of years now. At first it was really bad, I couldn't function at all. Really unbearable despair. I managed to ..uh.. normalize it I guess. I learned how function again and suppress the worst feelings of depression.

The thing is, I haven't really been able to feel any joy since then. I feel like for two years I've been going through the motions, what I was previously passionate about are now just hobbies to pass the time. I get no enjoyment from anything. I'm slowly feeling more and more detached from myself and my life. I don't feel like I know what to do anymore, what I care about, what makes me happy.

It's becoming increasingly hard to remember the chronology of anything, how many years it's been since high school, how many years since I was last in a relationship (I'm using that term very loosely for my previous ""relationship""), what I did on the weekend, what I did yesterday.

It's like there's only now, the past is this hazy void and the future is equally indistinct. Everything feels less and less hopeful. All I really feel now is this constant vague sense of regret, anxiety, loneliness and longing for something to make me feel awake. All the time I feel like I'm in that half-waking state when you wake up in the middle of the night. It's getting harder to bring myself to do the most basic tasks like cleaning my room or cooking food. I interact with more people than ever but I feel far more isolated than I ever, like I'm lonely in a crowd. Everyone's going about their lives with purpose and passion and I'm just kinda floating.

And it seems like this is the real horror. When I was really depressed at least I felt focused and real emotions, even if it was painful. This is somehow even worse because it's so much harder to make sense of anything, the pain is far more vague. Has anyone seen Synecdoche, New York? There's a description of the main character that goes 

    Well, Caden Cotard
    is a man already dead.

    He, um, lives in a half world
    between stasis and antistasis

    and time is concentrated,
    chronology confused.

dcyqi,depression,isuckatcollege,"Fuck college, and everything else","Backstory: I took a year off between high school and college. I spent most of my time in Denver, which was great. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a job the entire time, besides being a telemarketer for three days. Because of this, my roommate hated me, which led to me eventually moving out. I also started drinking heavily during this time.

When I got back to my parents' house, I was dreading college. A year ago, I thought I wanted to live in New York. Now I realized I wanted to be anywhere but there, yet there was no way to change this. So I just sort of accepted it. I ended up visiting Denver again for a week just before starting school, which just made me more depressed when I remembered how much I missed Colorado, and how much I would love to stay there and forget about school.

Now I'm a couple weeks in, and it is awful. I don't like my roommate, my classes, the area, the other people who go here, nothing. I'm incredibly confused and overwhelmed by my schedule and classes. I feel like everyone here gets what's going on and I'm on another planet. The only release I get is skating, but I'm becoming even less motivated to do that.

I drink every day and every night, due to social anxiety and sleep problems. If I don't drink, I become unreasonably anxious, and will NOT sleep. If I somehow find unconsciousness, it will be accompanied by awful nightmares, always.

I don't know what to do. I'd like to transfer mid-year but I wouldn't even know how to start, and I'm not even sure if it's possible. If I dropped or flunked out, my parents would be devastated. Obviously the first thing you guys will say is to cut down on the drinking, but I feel like I'm not in any position to effectively work on that right now. I'm just at a loss. I'm not even sure why I made this post really, I hate taking other people's advice and am generally selfish when it comes to my bad habits, namely drinking.

dd1ei,depression,soellipsesetc,I feel so sad...,"Well, it's funny how your life is fine one day, and totally bad the next.

Background on me: 21, male, gay, single, midwest states, attending university, seeing counseling at my university.  I've been diagnosed with depression for 5 years. I'm in a fraternity, which a majority of my friends are from.  I don't really have many friends, I'm very shy and I don't seem to fit into the LGBT crowd.

The last year, I met one of my best friends, and eventually fell for him.  He didn't (and still doesn't want) a relationship.  I can't stop thinking about him and he's one of the few people who can make me smile and feel like life is worth something.  This weekend though, I really pissed him off.  My depression makes me very clingy to him.  I somehow got into a nervous breakdown and mania stage and overtexted him on Saturday and got very upset at him.

As a result of my breakdown, I asked to be put at inactive status with my fraternity(a status where I would not be involved/invited with the fraternity for a period of time).  During this process, I've said some things that made me even hate myself; but more importantly where it made my friends hate me.  I don't blame them.

Well, the thing I've noticed is that everytime things go well in my life, I fuck it up with these mania stages.  I feel like crap, and have been crying the last 2 couple of nights/days.  I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so alone and scared with no support.  I wish I had someone who understood me and loved me.  I haven't been feeling like myself recently.",7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dd1ei/i_feel_so_sad/,1284349413

1. Do you only submit or do you look at other posts in the subreddit for help and advice?  
2. What has been the most helpful advice someone has given you?  
3. What has been the least helpful (besides any inappropriate comments [sorry if that happened])?  
4. Did you ever think, ""I just want someone to say _______"" and no one did? What was it?  
5. Which made you feel best: hearing advice, hearing a fellow redditor's story, or just hearing someone was there to listen if you wanted to talk?  
  
It would be great if you could answer any or all to help other redditors in the future. I know it's such a different experience for everyone that comes here, but I think some insight will help us all.

dd6ps,depression,partygnome,Rediscovering myself,"I have suffered symptoms of depression for about thirty years now. Most days have been fairly good, but there were days when I couldn't hold it together. A couple weeks ago, I had two major breakdowns and came very close to a third before I had to admit that I was powerless to fight this alone. My wife, who I love dearly but haven't shown it of late, has been a great help in supporting me through all of this. With her help, I made an appointment to see a psychologist. He recommended Prozac, but since he couldn't prescribe it, suggested that I get my physician to do so. 

It's now been just over a week and I can feel the effects of the Prozac starting to work. I am certainly happier, but more importantly, things that use to bring me down I can now handle a lot better. I am also falling in love with my wife all over again. It's hard for me to describe it, but I find her more beautiful and caring than before. I know that I haven't been the best husband and lover the past few years, which coincides with my recent decline into the darkness. I know that when I feel down, I crawl into myself and not allow others to know how I'm feeling. That is not who I want to be; it is a part of me, but not a part I want to experience nor is it a part of me that I want others to see. My meds, along with seeing my psychiatrist, is allowing me to rediscover who I am and who I want to be.",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dd6ps/rediscovering_myself/,1284384123
ddedh,depression,origamiguy,"I'm really down, I don't know what to do..","Ok, little backstory, I'm 17, starting my second year of college tomorrow, unemployed.

I'll go to college, have a great time during the breaks hanging out with my friends, playing poker, having a laugh. Lessons are just about bearable.

I've been finding that when I'm at home, I feel really down. I look to the future, I see myself spending 99% of my time stuck in an office, doing pointless work that merely pushes this capitalist world onward.

I look to the college work I do, I barely understand it now after eight weeks off. Attempting holiday homework (who the fuck thought that was a good idea?) at the end of the holiday was suicide.

My parents never seem to praise me, never appreciate what I do, it's always whinge moan nag whinge moan nag...

I'm really at a loose end, I find myself crying uncontrollably a lot, and I don't know what to do. All I feel I want in this world is to be left alone with my laptop and the Internet. At least while I'm at home - I like my friends, I have good times with them. I just don't want to be constantly moaned at, controlled and manipulated. 

I guess it comes down to this: I just want to be free.

ddg9y,depression,jkdarlton,I'm a lesbian at a school in Alabama. Really lonely and depressed.,"I'm a student a university in Alabama. I'm a lesbian. I don't belong here. And not just because I'm a lesbian. I just have nothing in common with most of these people. But please don't suggest that I transfer. I'd absolutely love to and actually told my father as much. But when I told him this, it was a huge fucking thing, and he made me feel really bad about it. So transferring is out of the question. I would have loved to go to school somewhere else, but my dad is a single parent, and we're barely affording my school as it is.

I have ""friends,"" but I really only hang out with this one girl. She's become my best friend, but we can only hang out so much. And I feel like I can't be my full self with her because of her Christianity.

I have another girl that I'm friends with, but she's in a serious relationship with someone that she's living with. Her life pretty much revolves around that, so I never see her.

I had other good friends that weren't at my school, but whom I talked to often. One moved to Portland and stopped answering my calls shortly thereafter with no explanation. Another is extremely Christian, and we've drifted apart over the past year. But that's probably my fault. I have another girl who I dated a few years ago, and we're (just) best friends now. She's at school in North Carolina, and her boyfriend just killed himself. So I'd feel like the biggest asshole if I called to complain about how lonely I am.

I tried going to the Gay Straight Alliance a few times last year, but it didn't suit me. It was very clique-ish, and I felt totally alone and unwanted. I tried to be friendly, but was ultimately ignored. I ended up making friends with one girl who I thought might be something more, and I've actually been texting with her and trying to hang out. But she never initiates. And when I do text her, it's all short answers that give me nothing to work with. So I'm convinced that she's completely uninterested and that I'm irritating her.

So basically....I just go to class and sit in my room doing homework, watching some TV, and browsing Reddit.

I'm so lonely. Right now, I'm sitting in my claustrophobic dorm room, watching Family Guy, browsing Reddit.

I don't know if I'm asking for advice or just complaining or what. I just know that I'm practically crying right now, and I'm tired of feeling so alone.

ddqmc,depression,Loveless_girl,I'm at my wits end and I have no idea what to do,"Here's my (hopefully not too large) emotional rant. Recently I've been feeling really down. I'm pretty sure it's depression. I have been unable to eat or sleep properly. I've been completely unmotivated to get up for school, and seeing as I have a rather high absence already - I might get kicked out. I'm 21, jobless and still living with my parents. But the main reason that I'm so upset is because of my rocky breakup with my boyfriend of 2 years. 

He broke it off because he was having doubts about us, and he told me that he didn't want to cheat on me. I was told by a classmate (her boyfriend was my boyfriends friend) that he had cheated on me in the begining of our relationship. I asked him about this, and he said it was true. I (probably stupidly) forgave him for that, and we gave things another go. A week after that he broke it off again, saying that he had once again lied earlier and that it wasn't just one girl, it was several throughout our entire relationship. I was really crushed, and we agreed to break contact with each other. We ended up bumping into each other in town a week later and realizing how much we missed each other, started dating again. 

For two weeks I thought that we were actually going to be able to get through this, but then he told me that he just wasn't ready for a relationship. I asked him why he said he wanted to try it again, and he said that it was because he loved me. He said that he still loves me, he just wants to be friends with me. (If anyone can help explain how this works, I would greatly appreciate it). He said that he wanted me to get over him and move on, but I just can't let him go. I have this slim bit of hope that maybe sometime in the future we can still be together. (Yes I am aware of how stupid this is.)

Our last (and final) break up happened about two weeks ago. Ever since then I've been desperately trying to keep up with school (IB in all it's glory.), but I've been finding it increasingly hard to find motivation to get out of bed. If I wake up early during the day and I can't go back to sleep, I'll stay up most of the day crying. I don't eat as much food as I used to, I seemed to have lost my appetite. I'm terrified to go to sleep at night, because I know I'll dream of him and end up lying in bed crying for hours. 

We are still talking on a friends basis and we have hung out (just watching movies) a few times. But being with him saddens me so much, because it's like having a constant reminder of what we had. Plus I just wish I could touch him and be as close to him as I was before. But I can't stand being away from him, because we became so close during our relationship, and he is my best friend. 

What I'm asking reddit, is should I continue being friends with him, or should I break contact and cut him out of my life?",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ddqmc/im_at_my_wits_end_and_i_have_no_idea_what_to_do/,1284480652
ddz39,depression,scared74,I have panic attacks and my gf's mother was just diagnosed with terminal cancer - I'm trying to support her as best I can but the stress is hitting me hard &lt;cont'd&gt;,"I'm 36 and never had anyone close to me die.  My gf of 4 years found out a few weeks ago that her mother has pancreatic cancer and was of course devastated but is handling it very well, mostly by focusing on ways to get treatment for her mother, etc.  

The first week my mostly under control panic disorder freaked out.  I thought almost any moment of that first week I was going to die.  Before I confess this next part I have to explain.  I never had a lot of friends growing up, a small group of good people.  All of them have moved from the town I'm from and I'm still here, I have good acquaintances at work, but not close enough for heart to heart talks.  So during all of this I feel I have no one to talk to about all this stress.

Now the confession part, I had a panic attack when the first happened while my gf was trying to talk to me about everything and I spurted out that I didn't know if I could handle this.  Soon as the words left my mouth I regretted them and felt immediately ashamed, my gf was of course hurt.  Then tonight we got more results which were very bad again when we hoped they might be good.   I had things under control for most of the night we had a hour long talk, but as it gets later in the night my control slips, unfortunately that's when hers does as well and she really needs me. 
Now there are talks of us giving up our apartment if she dies and moving in to my girlfriend's mother's house.  A house I never liked and would like even less with the memories of a dead women around every corner.  There are good reasons to live in the house, the house will not be covered by insurance without us in it, there are other tenants , my girlfriend is currently out of work and this would be rent free, and so on.  It's not that I won't, its just its so much change, so fast, its all so unfair to everyone, especially my gf and her mother.

Reddit I feel so ashamed for being so weak, to falter when I'm needed most, I want to be a rock for her, to keep her safe.  But then my body and mind betray me and I have these horrible panic attacks where I think I'm going to pass out or die every passing second and that I can't handle the stress and I just want to be comforted.  But of course I can't ask a my gf to comfort me while she is the one that really needs the comfort.

I do have a psychiatrist who is helping me with these things.  But when I'm there I'm more relaxed and things seem distant and not so urgent so the proper things aren't always talked about.

de177,depression,brawrawr,Diagnosis?,"I recently had some emotional trauma in the past few months. I've been working hard to get over it and though I'm sort of selfish on days I feel more down, I am more or less normal...I think?

During the nights, the past two weeks I've talked out loud and had conversations (I was doing this purposely, I think) with an 'old friend', as if he were there beside me, while lying in bed for several hours at night. I'll get worked up and start crying, then be really exhausted and either repeat the process of talking + crying or pass out (not literally, but..fall asleep) afterward.

In the past three months, I've had about 5-7 occasions while dealing with my close friends/family where I got extremely angry and scream/belittle them, and then feel helpless, useless, and beg the person I'm talking to to come back and hug me and tell me they forgive me. During those points, time seems to extend tenfold, but it's really only a matter of minutes. Also during these points, I feel completely out of control...I'll pick up scissors, start massively scratching myself, and just try to hurt myself while begging the person to help me. I distinctly remember the same thought ""I want to kill myself"" going through my head a thousand times in my head, and then slowly disappearing as my mother came to give me a hug and calm me down.

The last time the begging/helplessness issue happened was about a month ago. But the talking while I lie in bed is becoming a habit for me now. Is this...anything? I'm not comfortable talking about the 'emotional trauma' that happened to me, but...something like this has never happened to me before.

de1wh,depression,throwawayconfusion,Almost 20 and haven't been happy since I was 14..help?,"I will be 20 in October and I basically haven't been happy since the day my mom and dad divorced. My mom had MS and she was declining fast. One night my parents were arguing and my dad (step father; only dad I ever knew) decided it was a good idea to throw my wheelchair bound mom into out swimming pool. Some how she survived and swam to the shallow end and called the police. They separated that night. Flash forward two years and you see me as a fat, not so depressed 16 year old. I played World of Warcraft 12-15 hours a day and while my mom was bed bound, i didn't care to help her. I didn't want to help her. I wanted to play my game. My brother was 12 and he was beginning to not want to follow rules etc etc. My girlfriend and her family helped all the time with our problem since I was a freshman in HS. While my mom was still bedridden, I watched her suffer and hear her suffer because of my stupidity and negligence for wanting to help. She would need her diaper changed at night and wanted to be fed at night as well...except I didn't want to do it and went to sleep. She was in horrible pain, had infections, sores, you name it. This was ALL MY FAULT. I was stupid and didn't care.

Three years later and I am a drop out. I stayed until the very last day of HS. No diploma, no GED. I had to send my mom to a nursing home. STUPIDEST thing that ever came out of my mouth. I never went to see her and when I did, I would hate it. But yet, I secretly missed my mom. I really did. I wanted her to move, I wanted her to talk. I wanted her to be normal. All I did was run away from trying to help her because I was too stupid. 

So, April of 2010 my gf breaks up with me after almost 5 years together because I had just given up and I was becoming more and more of a douche bag to her and her family. We get back together in May because I basically pleaded with her. The last few weeks I have noticed she has been turning into a self absorbed person. She hasn't shown ANY effort into getting a job nor does she want to move in with me. I have a steady job that I have been at for a year now and an apartment with my cat. I tell her that if she really loves me, to move in. Her excuse? She has no job and we don't have enough money to cover expenses. She hasn't gone out to look, she graduated with a 4.0 and top 20 of her class and her parents won't pay for her to go to college. Not even community college. She's almost 20 and still lives at her parents with no work history.

Back to my mom, she passed away on August 7th. She died from starvation from what I was told. When I went to see her for her last two weeks, I couldn't stand the sight. I couldn't even understand how it got this bad. All I could think about was what I had done to her. I made her this way. I gave her all this pain. I saw it in her face that she still loved me and wanted me to live day by day, but I still think about every single time I didn't want to help her. 

I am a lazy and terrible person. I don't know how I could have done what I did to her.

I haven't seen a doctor since I was 13, and since then, I haven't asked about what is wrong with me. I think and I'm not sure, I might have some sort of anxiety or disorder because I do not like being around people, yet I WANT to be around people. I just can't do it. I can't even go anywhere by myself. I have to have someone with me in order to buy groceries, go to the park, etc. I know I have depression and I set it aside because I don't feel like taking pills for it. I never liked pills because the medicine that the doctors gave to my mom, destroyed her. It basically made her a mindless zombie just so her pain would go away, yet they would do more damage than help her.

Now, present day, I feel like I'm losing myself because I can't even talk to my girlfriend of 5 years how I'm feeling. I feel like she doesn't want me anymore, I feel she wants to move on because I am just not interesting anymore. I now know how it feels to be married, yet I don't know how I could be interesting when I go out every day to work when she stays at home and does nothing. I just want everything to end.

I don't have any family left other than my brother (step dad and my mom's) and my grandparents who live in Germany. I live in the southwest part of the US. I don't have any friends that I hang out with because everyone I know always gets drunk or high. I don't drink nor do I smoke.

Reddit, what should I do?
I know some are going to say go to therapy, but my job only brings home $1300 a month and my rent is $520 a month. Also, I can't even bring myself to go anywhere, and I mean anywhere by myself.

TL;DR, I am almost 20 and have lost my mom to MS with my neglect. I might have some kind of disorder or something, but I don't know what it is.",7,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/de1wh/almost_20_and_havent_been_happy_since_i_was_14help/,1284530723

Dear depression,

I feel my life is really crushed right now. I've built my hopes and dreams with this woman as the foundation. Now that foundation has collapsed. Let's just say I've invested my time and efforts on the wrong person. And all these failed expectations is really making me feel depressed.

You see, I'm in a poor country and psychiatrists are not at all a popular profession here. And besides, even if I found one, I might not even be able to afford sessions and prescriptions.

Are there any non-prescription antidepressants that I could take, that -- you know -- would make me happy and calm sometimes...make me forget sometimes? (Sorry, no illegal stuff please. Also, pot is illegal here and i don't smoke)

i don't even know what to say.  

i dated a girl for about 3 months and really liked her but wasn't feeling anymore than extreme LIKE.  i hadn't had a steady girlfriend for about 8 years, and i was tired of being alone.  so i forced it.  and, throughout the course of the relationship, i became more and more depressed and empty.  i was betraying myself, because, somewhere inside me, i thought i wasn't going to fall in love with this girl.  and that means i was essentially leading her on.  at the end, i told her i was confused.  i told her that there were times i thought i was falling for her, and times that i wasn't, which was true.  but that wasn't fair to her, because i could tell she was falling for me.

the physical side effects began a couple of days before i told her.  the last two times we made out, i couldn't even achieve an erection.  mentally, i was emptied.  and scared.  usually i get one within the first few seconds or minutes of a make-out session.  then, nothing.  i feel so ashamed about this.  i feel like less of a man.  i judge myself by the frequency, duration, and strength of my erections.  i judge myself constantly.

i'm terrible at sex.  i can only last 2-4 minutes before finishing.  and if i don't finish, i eventually just lose my erection because i'm tired and i know i'm not going to give her an orgasm.  i only gave her one.  i'm less of a man.  how can i maintain a relationship with a woman if i can't sexually satisfy her?  i couldn't go down on her because of some issues i don't want to explain right now.

i feel so guilty about everything.  i just want to fall in love with SOMEONE.  everyone else around me is getting married and having babies.  what is wrong with me?  why did i skip work today because i didn't have enough strength to roll out of bed?  why did i spend all morning crying about this?  by the time i find someone, will i be so old that i won't even be able to maintain an erection without drugs?  how will i be able to satisfy a woman?

lately i've been snapping at people at work.  the other day i went into the bathroom and cried in the bathroom stall.  i can't even keep it together there.

this has been going on for so fucking long.  the guilt, shame, insecurity, self-loathing.  i've tried drugs.  i've tried therapy.  i can't stick with either, and i'm falling apart.  i've always been depressed and i've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and mild OCD.

dey33,depression,depression_issue,Could anybody please refer me to a good psychiatrist near Los Altos/Mountain View area or Downtown San Jose area?,"Hi

I am seeking for a good psychiatrist in Mountain View/Los Altos area or near downtown San Jose. If anybody has experience with any of them that would be great. My wife is suffering from depression for quite a long time and now I really want her to to be seen by a specialist. She was seen by a Doctor in Stanford few months back as she complained of tiredness, anxiety, physical weakness etc. The Doctor did all the check ups and found her healthy and referred to a psychiatrist. I have a Blue Shield PPO plan, and they find Doctors through a MHSA (Mental Health Service Administrator) network.

Besides a referral, I would also request for good advices. Here is my situation.

We have Indian background. We are married for almost 7 years.  I think that our life is pretty stable financially. We both are doing jobs and earn $120k. We do not have any debt (except our two cheap cars for &lt;$10k), we have retirement savings of more than $15k, shares for more than $6k, savings cash &gt; $2k, higher education savings for &gt;$2k etc. We got to this financial stage after few years of struggle in our studies, job etc. We have an amazing (I mean really amazing) 2 year old son. However, my wife have had quite a few self image issues for some time. Sometimes, she gets sad about her looks, sometimes because our (supposedly) poor financial condition (we cannot afford a house at this time), sometimes because we cannot go around and enjoy night life of clubs, sometimes because we cannot just enjoy vacation in different places of world (and our all friends have been), sometimes I didn't do anything special for her Birthday etc. Sometimes she feels bad for her boring life. Doing household work doesn't interest her much and hiring a maid would reduce her potential savings for buying a house. She joined a tennis class last week and all three days before her first class she was sad about not being able to get a skirt she wanted. Sometimes she feels her office mates do not like her and so forth.

I am not a super man and these general unhappiness are actually killing me. I am happy with almost everything I have, except this constant depression. I am trying to keep my cool now, but earlier I used to just blast and have broken a few things at house. I am really not proud of those moments and I want those things to stay in past and never reoccur.  

We have had sex at most 2 times for last 2-3 months. This is pretty much our general frequency.

Few months back we went to a Marriage Counselor after quite a bit of convincing and the counselor was dozing off through the session. Remaining times he was worried how we will be paid and then he spent time giving regular warnings. So that didn't help us much either.

At this point, I think we can only restart our life after she gets treated for depression. I thank you if you have reached so far in reading my story. I would really appreciate any support.

Thanks again.

*Edit: Does nobody know a psychiatrist in this area?*

*Edit: Thanks for the suggestions guys. I wish I had good news for you. My patience gave up today when my wife started complaining about my Mom. After quite a bit of trying to sustain, I broke a cup on my feet that resulted in 15 stitches :(.  I have been trying to contact with psychiatrists for quite some time, whose number I got from my insurance provider, but they have not called me back yet. Life is really a downer.*

So I set out to do just that and I've been watching the quality of my life get better with time, I've been proud of myself and happy with the improvements I've been making. 

Today however, it hit me that I'm not just improving myself, I'm actually becoming someone else; and it made me so very sad that I had to give up on who I am in order to fit in this cruel world. I just want to hug my old self and say I'm so sorry that I had to abandon you in order to be happy.. I'm sorry that this world didn't appreciate what you had to offer and demanded more.

When I was 16 I tried to kill myself and ended up in a psychiatry program at a clinic for a few weeks. As I got older, I got a girlfriend and my friends rallied around me and I felt better. Well over the summer my girlfriend dumped me and I felt those feelings start to creep back. She seemed like a cap on all the negative shit I had going on and when she left it all came seeping back out. We both go to the same college, and one night I got up the courage and ended up talking to her and we had started talking about getting bet together. We were spending a lot of time together, sleeping in the same bed every night and we even lost our virginities to each other. I messed up though, ended up saying something awful to her and she left again, this just happened yesterday and today. Since then though, I feel like everything's falling apart around me. My parents came up to my school and brought me home for the weekend after I told them that I needed to get help. I told my ex I was getting help and she's happy for me, and has been telling me everything will be ok. I want to believe her and everyone else but I'm just so scared and I don't know what to do.

dg4sr,depression,ShabidoSaroo,I'm just feeling stressed...,"Hey /r/depression, long time reader first time poster.

So my life's been complicated as of recent. After being fired from my first job earlier this year, I searched and searched for a job that didn't require any experience. I finally found one, applied, and somehow got it. The job involves me going from business to business and analyzing their phone bill. Basically trying to save them money or add stuff to make their business run better.

Now I'm a very introverted person so this job is *really* draining for me. It doesn't help that the job is completely commission based, so if I don't do well I don't get paid. And so far I've just sucked at my job every day. The goal of the job is to make $100 a day, and if you don't do that consistently you'll get fired. So far I've only done that one day so at this rate I'll be fired so why not just quit now?

It's also a very goal oriented job and I've been asked by my coworkers so many times what my long term goals are. I've never had long term goals. For about 8 years of my life the only thing I was certain about my future is that I was going to eventually kill myself so there was no reason to plan for anything. I'm (mostly) past those feelings but I still dread questions relating to long term goals and all this job does is remind me that I don't have any and how that's a bad thing.

My sister and brother-in-law lost their jobs recently. They got new jobs near where I live so they're going to move into my house for a couple weeks while they get settled. Now they're not bad people and it's not like I hate them, I just don't enjoy their company. Not to mention they like to snoop on my computer and through my stuff, so I always have to spend time snoop proofing my room whenever they visit.

I honestly don't think I'll be able to handle the stress of sucking at my job and them moving in. I really just want to quit my job and sulk; but, I think my family will look down on me for being a quitter, especially after being recently fired. I think they'll just guilt me into thinking that it was the wrong decision to make, even if this job makes me unhappy.",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dg4sr/im_just_feeling_stressed/,1284943855
dgckq,depression,Gnodab,"depressed. (obviously, or I wouldn't be posting here!)","24. Depressed. My father died when I was a kid, and my mother has spent the better part of the last 15 years not managing her diabetes so that she could be ""accidentally"" (she uses the bible as a roadmap to her life so that she doesn't have to take any responsibility for her actions, which is stupid, because she has to live with the results of what she does. also replaces what she wants the bible to say with what it actually says) reunited with him. Grew up in what I can only describe as a suburb of DC, although it was much more in the boondocks than a suburb. She did a pretty good job of alienating every person in the neighborhood, having to have an ambulance called for her every day and at all times of night for so long. Being confined to a small community of 100 people or so when they all hate your guts without any ability to leave sucks. to put it lightly.

anyways, Now I'm 24. I still live with her, and she still does a pretty good job of alienating every person that she comes in contact with. I have no idea of what to do with my life; due to her psychoticness (for lack of a better word) and the fact that we lived in a place where you needed a car to do anything, I've never been able to see what anyone does for a living (hence why I have no idea what to do with my life. how could I? Being a cop on CSI looks awesome and all, but it's not exactly what being a cop is actually like!). I'm fairly intelligent, having a 3.5 in college before I dropped out for lack of any idea of what to major in. thinking of going back, but still have no idea what to major in. I've spent the last 5 or 6 years with a daily meditation practice, so despite how incredibly hopeless this situation seems to me, it doesn't get me all that down. Just more down than I'd like to be.

dgdcx,depression,partygnome,Trying to hold it together today,"I'm sure that most everyone has had days when it seems like things are just too much to deal with. Today just happens to be one of those days. My wife is anxious to move out of our apartment and into a house. So, over the weekend, we looked at some houses for rent and found one that fits our requirements. Now, I support my wife's desire to move, but the idea of packing up and moving is starting to cause me some anxiety and stress. This on top of the normal day-to-day BS, plus I have to shore up my dossier for tenure. Even with the Prozac, I find myself coming close to tears.

I'm going to see my psychologist tomorrow, but trying to deal with the added stress is seemingly impossible. Okay, I know that it is possible, but I'm having trouble at the moment and just time and a venue to vent my feelings. I told my wife last night about my feelings; I feel that openness and honesty is important here, especially if I hope to get better. She told me that she gets scared for me sometimes and that she feels guilty for putting her needs and desires ahead of mine; of course, this just adds another layer to the pile of stress I'm already having to deal with, but her happiness is important, too. I don't want to be a ""selfish prick"", so I naturally bite the bullet. I think that is part of my problem: I tend to repress my feelings and desires for others'.

I know that the move will be beneficial for both of us, but I also know the stress that it causes. I know that if it weren't for the Prozac, I'd be curled up in the fetal position crying my eyes out and wishing I would just disappear from the world. And there is a part of me that thinks it's unseemly for a 41 year old man to be crippled by depression and stress, but, I am and, well, there you are. Somehow I feel like I should be stronger, but I'm not; deep down, I'm really, really scared, like a five year old lost in the mall.

dgluh,depression,emotionlessbum,I don't care about anything anymore but I don't want to stay this way.,"I guess I'm posting this because I'm depressed and want to get stuff off my chest and hopefully get some responses.

I have no idea why I'm depressed. I am so blessed. I had a great upbringing: loving parents, wasn't abused in anyway (physically, emotionally, etc), no scarring events in my life, lots of friends growing up, and just all in all a great childhood/high school/university experience. I'm 26 now and have a great paying job, a car, and a nice condo. I've got awesome friends, and a loving family (though I don't see them too often since I don't live in the same town anymore).  I should be one of the happiest guys on the planet right now. But I'm not.

I don't want to do anything. I'm depressed *and* lazy. Bad combination. I wake up each morning wishing I could just lay there all day. I don't put in any effort at work because I just don't feel like it (I'm surprised I haven't been fired or even disciplined yet). Even things I normally love doing like hanging out with friends doesn't bring me joy or happiness anymore. I've cancelled on people so many times these past 2 months pretending I don't feel well simply because I just didn't want to make the effort and go out. I simply don't care about anything anymore and I don't have the willpower to do anything about it.

I don't want to stay this way though. I want to care. I want to be able to work hard and enjoy it. I want to be able to enjoy the company of friends &amp; family. I want to stop being so lazy. I want to get out of this funk. I want to make something of my life. Why can't I do this? How do I get myself motivated again?


**TL;DR**: I have no reason to be depressed yet I don't care about or do anything. I need to get out of this crappy state! What can I do?


**EDIT:**

Thanks to everyone who's responded. What you've said is basically what friends &amp; family have been telling me and basically what I've always known in the back of my head: I need to stop over-thinking this, get out of my head, and do something about it. I wish this was something I could easily do, but I guess nothing good comes easy.

dgnsg,depression,accountimadeforfun,Miserable.,"I'm a 22 year old male. I graduated college with a degree in Psychology. I have been unemployed for almost 2 years. I have no career aspirations. I only love music and I only love it alone. Also, I hate being alone. I cope with it by playing music.

My friends, while few, are around. They never call me, I always call them. I am always on the periphery. When people meet my friends through me, they become better friends with them than I am.

My love life is nonexistent. I have never had a girlfriend, I have had 3 one night stands in my life that have mostly made me feel worse about my sex life (or lack thereof). It's frustrating, because despite my constant self loathing, I sort of know/understand I am an attractive guy. I'm very tall and not fat/awkward, funny, adventurous and intelligent. Despite this, my disposition appears to constantly keep me sunk in this rut.

I am miserable every day. I start have been drinking and smoking weed every day since I moved here 20 days ago (not that it was much different before then...), and I see no end in sight.

I hate my life and everything I do irks me in some way. I'm scared, directionless but educated, talented but unmotivated, and miserable. I am struggling to cope with my stress, what do I do? 
This is mostly just venting. I'm drinking alone and miserable and don't know what to do with myself. Blah.

dgq4e,depression,Spectacularworlds,Just not sure anymore. ,"Hi Reddit. I stopped by once to post in suicidewatch but I decided not to. It's been around 1.5-2 years now since that time. This is going to be long with no tl;dr attached, just as forewarning for those short of time.

I'm a smart guy, I always have been. Throughout my time in school I made B+ usually. I could easily have gotten A's and more but I never had any motivation, no will to try. I never have. Growing up I moved around multiple times a year going to multiple different schools, always having to make new friends. Being an overweight child it could be hard making friends all the time but through sheer willpower and personality I stumbled through it. I held my friends dear to my heart and I always ended up having them ripped away from me in the end. 

I've always felt something has been off with me as a person, as a human being, but back then I simply enjoyed being a kid. Growing up though was where it all backfired. Through middle school I started losing all motivation and faith I had in myself because of mathematics. Moving around all the time and going to different schools with the same base curriculum but different methods of teaching, being in different areas of the curriculum and etc left me grasping for straws in 6th grade. The only reason I made it that far was because I was smart, I got away with brushing it off under the rug until then. 

At the end of that year I ended up failing our state test and being placed into 2 math classes. It helped though and I passed that year and the next. 

I ended up getting a girlfriend in 8th grade and I loved her more than the world. To this day I still love her, she was the first person who ever really gave me a chance, who actually believed in me. We broke up at the beginning of 9th grade and it killed me. Everything fell apart on me. My grades plummeted, I quit band, and I tried so hard to hold on while my world spun around me day after day. I ended up going into homeschooling at the end of the semester. It lasted through the second semester and then I quit that too.

I went back to school for Sophomore year after the summer to give it another try. I was back to my old self for a while. I was doing great in math, wonderful teachers in every class, I had some close friends from middle school to hang out with, and then it all went to shit. I still don't know what happened but I can try and guess. (I'm a dropout now for future reference.)

I'm very..different when it comes to others my age. I don't go out, I have very few close friends and they're all I've ever cared to need. I play video games to escape from reality. I was raised Christian but I guess I lean more towards Agnostic now, who knows. I believe in a greater being, a God above gods, destiny, fate, etc. What makes me feel so different is my blind faith in love. 

I wasn't raised to believe in love, I wasn't influenced by others around me, I've felt this way since I can coherently remember. I've always had a yearning to have someone I could love with my entire being. It's what has kept me going for so long. When I look at someone I think I would be interested in I think to myself, ""Would I marry this person? Do I think I could marry this person?"" If not, I move on then and there. 

All I want anymore is someone to love, someone to love me. I've always felt so alone and the more I look at the more I can't stand it anymore. I got a job a few months ago and I can't stand it anymore. It feels like such a waste of time and life. I'm getting my GED soon and I plan on going to community college and transferring after basics are out of the way but I feel myself sinking back into that hell from school. If this is how life is I'm unsure if I want to be a part of it. I've always had thoughts of suicide but I don't think I could ever do it. 

People everywhere out there say it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem and all that jazz, but is it really? Who says things are going to pick up for me? I don't know what to do anymore. I've been to a doctor for depression and all he could do was refer me to a therapist. I don't think I would want drugs anyway. I'm just sick of being like this and I don't know if I can pull myself out of it much longer. I've only made it this far on the idea of love and my own twisted, cynical logic.

dh5bd,depression,Johnbishop,"Bang and drop, motherfuckers.","##Throw-away account.

I missed work today because I was depressed enough that I couldn't be bothered to get dressed.  Ended up just sleeping away most of the day, and watching TV for the rest.

This is something that happens a lot in my life.  I can't even begin to count how many days have been lost to my depression.  How many hours of wasted time.  Not just wasted, though.  Hours of self-recriminations, and misery.  Hours of staring out at a world in which other people do things, achieve things, feel something other than darkness.

I've done CBT; I've taken a variety of meds.  They help a lot.  But there's still times when nothing seems to help.  I try to identify what triggers them, and to eliminate those triggers, but I'm in my fucking 40s and it keeps on happening.

I really, really relish the thought of suicide.  No, that's not right.  I relish the thought of being dead.  Of never having to wonder, ""When will it happen next?""  Of no longer just counting the days until my next fuck-up.  My next failure.  The next time I disappoint someone--myself included.

My brain is broken.  Or perhaps it's my mind, or my soul.  Whatever.  There is no cure.  And treatment too often feels like just putting off the inevitable.  Why not just take the short-cut to the next step?  Cut the suspense and find out if death is dissolution, or merely the transition to the next drawn-out torture that the universe has in store for me.

I suppose a shot-gun with bird shot would be the best option.  Though, I do wonder if I could someone get my hands on some .357 fragmentation rounds.  Those would be a pretty sure bet on success.  Just bang-and-drop.

I wonder how tough it would be to disappear first?  Travel to Mexico, and drop off the map.  Cash out everything I have, shred my credit cards and my ID.  Walk out onto a beach on the Baja peninsula, just bang-and-drop.  The tide rolls in, my body rolls out, and my family never really knows what happened.

I'm not putting this in r/suicidewatch because I don't want anyone to stop me.  Or try to talk me out of it.  Hell, I don't know why I'm writing about this at all.  I guess I want to see it in print.  To type out the details and see how much sense they make once they're outside my skull.

To disappear, or to try to explain?  Which would leave behind less pain?  It seems on the surface that the mystery of never knowing would be worse... but I'm not sure.  Because, I'm confident that they would never understand if I tried to explain.

But, who am I kidding?  That's not my priority.  The most important thing is myself.  Me.  MEmeME.  I'm just a selfish bastard, deciding whether I live or die based on my misery alone, and never considering anyone else's.

Except that it's not even misery.  It's just a pervasive sense of hopelessness.  Not that things are terrible, or will be terrible, but rather that they will be... more bad than they are good.  A balance of unhappy when my life is summed up.

Why bother?  Why struggle my mediocre little struggles, against the light rains and gentle breezes of misfortune?  Why strain to lift my leaden feet and plod my way over the little rises before me?

I can't even come up with a nice screed for a suicide note.  Nothing to rail against but the pettiness of life.  ""I killed myself because I couldn't face washing the dishes.""  Sad, but true.  Brush my teeth?  What, again?  I did that just yesterday.  Why spend over 20 hours a day just maintaining your life, so that you might briefly spend a little time achieving something, before you fall back into the clutches of mundanity again?

Tedium?  ""I killed myself because it takes so goddam long to do laundry.""  Privation?  ""I killed myself before I had to eat even one more fucking bowl of oatmeal.""

Oh and I can't trust you. Ever. I will always think you are sick of me and always assume you are never going to speak to me again every time you leave my sight. I prepare for these things, as that is usually how it happens. I don't get a ""sorry, it's not working out"" I just never hear from anyone again. It's pretty bad when they don't even feel the need to tell you why you got dumped, they just assume you know. 

At least you know I won't stalk you, I prefer running away with my tail between my legs never to be seen again.

I spent five years living with my own personal terrorist who destroyed my life and broke my mind and heart in to a million pieces. I won't ever talk about it more than to just say that. 

I have two kids who I love very much, but are being turned against me with lies. I never get to see them and to deal with that pain I have to suppress it or go insane with rage. So I keep suppressing it, and now I don't even remember what it was like to feel anything.

This really hindered how many friends I had and I had no friends that were girls really, let alone girlfriends.
Things got better later in high school when I met some people who became my social circle but then we all moved away to college soon after.

I made zero friends that year and although I did end up kissing a girl it was one that I had known from high school she said she was confused and apologized for leading me on because she didn't want a relationship right now.  This was during winter break between semester 1 and 2.  2 weeks back to the second semester she is dating some other guy at her school and I am crushed.  Too depressed to do my work and end up failing a bunch of my classes.

During the summer my parents wanted me to take some classes at my community college.  One I never went to and ended up dropping and they only found that out when I told them at therapy, the same session when I told them I was depressed.  Soon after I went on zoloft nad felt worse for a while but then a tiny bit better.  But my parents didn't want me to go back to college and instead stay home and take courses at the community college so they could keep an eye on me.  As paradoxical as it sounds, I still wanted to meet people, I just didn't know how.

But I still don't have any medication for it and I can't fucking do this anymore.  I feel fucking useless.  I can't accomplish anything or make friends or just be normal.  I tell my parents I am going to class, and then I go to a parking lot and cry/drive around till its time to go home.  I am a horrible liar and lie all the time which I hate.  I can't do this anymore.

I am finding it harder and harder to justify my own existence.  And please don't tell me its cause I'll be missed because I don't think thats true.

dhqnm,depression,[deleted],Forecast: Clouds until further notice,"Recently, I've been finding strength in friendships (as apposed to going through life as a lone wolf which hasn't been too successful, but I've distracted myself enough to get by up until now). Around people, any problem seems small and is dismissed just like that.

But in one week, I will never meet up with my classmates again. Inevitably we will all go our own ways. That's fine for those going into further study or back in to full time work who will create new experiences. But I don't know how I am going to manage it. I have no motivation to do anything, unless it's with these people. I have no desire to study unless it is with someone else, for someone else's gain. I have no desire to workout but I do anyway, to impress others.

I think I'm seriously deprived of companionship, and didn't even realise it until recently. I have no idea what I'm going to do to fill in that gap during the day where I would be with classmates. They have no idea that I have no friends besides them because I appear sociable, and have been finding the *game* of learning social skills interesting. Telling them how important they are to me isn't going to get me any points because nobody can have a fun time with a miserable, desperate person. I have to find a way to give this same message, but in a way which will make them want to keep in touch with me, not the other way around. I haven't ever had this happen yet.

I'm sure a permanent job position would help me get by, and I could focus my savings towards one goal (non-existent atm) but right now I'm not having much luck with employment due to lack of experience (19 years old, never had a payslip). Often people tell me I'm talented and will go far in life, but I don't have anything specifically to sell myself, nor do I feel like I deserve it. I give up to easily now after years of fearing failure, but still failing time and time again.

EDIT: One thing I forgot about is that I get these headaches which prevent me from concentrating. I'm beginning to think they come about when I'm in a situation I don't like such as talking about employment or studying? It sounds pathetic but maybe I am have a psychosomatic illness.

In two weeks time, I won't be getting out of bed until after noon. I'll take each day as it comes and plan no father than that. I will avoid social situations because nothing's new in my life. I will be forgotten, again.",6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dhqnm/forecast_clouds_until_further_notice/,1285228035

di321,depression,KadenTau,Crippled.,"Hey Reddit.

I don't know where to start with this. So I'll just ramble with as much sense as I can muster.

I'm 24, Male. Overweight, but not bad looking at all. Must be the Irish genes. I have no job, am existing from one monetary miracle to the next (begging for support from my very limited trust fund, financial aid which has *yet* to go through, unemployment that I'm not getting any more, etc), I'm living with my father who is struggling just as much as I am, if not more, and we are both brash and angry dudes. This doesn't end well sometimes. I got out of a LDR near the beginning of the year...and it took a lot for me to let her go. I still think about her. I'm stuck somewhere between missing her and being filled with hatred over the whole ordeal. That relationship marks the second of two ""serious"" relationships I've had...which have both managed to come about through the internet. I honestly thought this one would work; that we'd meet and all my wounds from the one before her would just melt away. Instead they ended up driving her away. I was so dumb to even think about doing the LDR thing twice, but..she was alluring. I've talked about that with so many people that when I try anymore my brain just stalls. I can't bring myself to talk about it any more. It's crushing, confusing, angering, and there's not a damn thing anyone can really do about it, or say to make it better. I think this is because she's the only one I've connected with so effortlessly over the past decade, and it all went to hell. It's like being forced to watch something very beautiful die very slowly.

I've been out of work since October of 2007, living with parents and friends while my will to change or live slowly eroded. This is not to say I haven't tried to find work. I've sent out my resume, and applied at a number of different places a lot. I've only seen a few interviews, and those that I got into successfully I feel I failed due to mental atrophy and just general apathy. I've been smoking on and off for months. There's one left, and I'll try to quit again after I smoke after typing this.

Basically: A number of variables has left me completely unmotivated, mentally and emotionally exhausted, unable to feel much of anything towards friends or family, and even a dollop of strong mistrust and paranoia of pretty much everyone whether I know them or not. I have no money that's not already spent, so I can't go to a shrink, much less pay for meds. I have 4 years of experience on my resume, and can't find shit (Tech Support, Deskside/Phone). Even aiming low for minimum wage is turning up nothing. I'm very easily angered, and some day feel happy, but the moment I lay down to nap because I'm bored, the tears will start. My imagination, runaway as it is, only comes up with even more depressing things to think about, hypothetical or otherwise. Tried to join the army, and they wouldn't take me because of my weight. That was encouraging. Thinking of joining the Peace Corp just because I want to leave this...goddamned *farce* behind and do something meaningful and productive with my life, but I have an obligation to finish out this term in school because the trust paid for it. I have mixed feelings about approaching women I'm attracted too. This is mostly because I am fully aware of my social anxiety, but at the same time know how to be smooth. Some sort of disconnect between my mind and my nerves I guess. Beyond that I second guess myself anyway because I feel worthless because of what little I have to offer other than my emotional mess, and don't trust anyone I meet not to be judgmental after my ex, because she was one of the most patient and understanding people I've ever met (I thought), but she decided to be selfish and take off on me too. If I can scare that away then what good am I to anyone else? I don't know, maybe she wasn't what she said she was, or what I perceived her to be. My memory, and often times I fear, my intelligence is being affected by the constant presence of all this in my mind. My head feels tense at the end of the day, and the best hours of those days are that hour when I wake up and don't exactly remember the various reasons I should be unhappy. I don't even think I remember what real happiness feels like, since my mind will wander only to the darkest places it can find. I feel like an emo kid, but maybe I'm just undermining my feelings to invalidate them so I can ignore them? I have no clue.

What the hell do I do? I've been like this to some degree for...christ...3 years now? I want out of this. I don't think I'll ever kill myself, but damned if my mind doesn't play with the idea just to make me more sad about it all. Instead I try to ignore the dark clouds over my head and try and keep going, but it's hard to ignore when they start raining, if you take my meaning.",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/di321/crippled/,1285285669

So throughout my life I have dealt with periods of depression and anger.  Some of this has been due to family matters (parents separated for awhile and the fighting that was involved with that) other parts just the feelings I had normally. Eventually I got over the anger problems with therapy once a week for about 4 years.  The anger issues were the easiest part to actually deal with. 

Once I got to college though everything seemed to run down hill from there and everything felt like it was crashing in on myself.  I had never had bouts of ""true"" depression until I was on my own.  I would stay in my room for weeks at a time and not leave except to eat, go to the bathroom or go to a test basically.  Eventually when I went back home to see my parents for a weekend I finally let everything go.  After this I saw my previous therapist a few more times and decided that maybe some medication along with normal therapy would be helpful.

I went back to school after starting my medication and talking to my therapist consistently.  I am currently happy, getting my work done in school and able to function like I want to.

dim6x,depression,herpderpitsme,Just going to be completely honest here.,"Hi reddit,

     Here's the deal, whenever i try to get help from anyone, i usually end up twisting stories all the time. this is usually because i know i might regret telling that person something. Yes i made a throwaway account, sorry, but i just want to be completely honest. Because i usually feel like an attention whore whenever i want some help, i usually shy away from it, or blow it off like I'm too good to need help.
     First of all, some background info on me. I'm 16 and a junior in High School. Basically, at the moment i have to admit, I'm a fuckin loser (lol). I am mentally fine. But i am socially stupid. What brings me to saying this? Throughout my life, I've never had any tight friendships with anyone, or a relationship with any girl.
     I'm just depressed at how socially stupid I am, and the fact that I have no idea to fix it. I usually fail at meeting people, and usually think about something too much before I do it, and by then the oppurtunity is taken from me.

I really don't even know where I'm trying to get, I just feel like i need to be more socially well.

dimey,depression,wtchappell,Depression is an illness,"While the title might seem obvious to some, its a fact I have to remind myself of whenever I feel down.

Sore throat?  Turn on a humidifier, take a lozenge.

Stuffed nose?  Drink hot tea, take a sudafed.

Scraped knee?  Put a bandaid on, find some neosporin.


But when I'm depressed, I forget that just like any other health issue, I should attempt to actually do something about it.  In fact, I usually do the opposite - I blame myself for the depression, I surround myself with images of pain, and I delude myself with futures of desperation.

Wouldn't it be odd for someone with a stuffed nose to blame themselves for it?  And wouldn't it be even weirder if they sought out jalapenos salted popcorn in an attempt to make it worse?  (And yes, I'm aware that my analogy could use some work...)  Yet, that's exactly what I do in depression.

The second you start feeling down and out - and this is still a revolutionary idea for me - *do something about it!*

Play a game, walk a dog, annoy a cat, order dessert, run some laps, go swimming, plant something, help someone else, take a smoke break, make a sandwich, look at lolcats - anything!

So often, if I feel down, my first reaction is to kick myself for it - I'll 'forget' to take medications, sleep through things and blame myself for it, avoid work and dwell on it...  Don't do these things.  Its a slippery slope.  Once you take a step down, you'll just pick up momentum.  

When you feel down, think about what's making you sad - and if, like me, they're irrelevant, self-created, trivial problems - tell them to fuck themselves.  Take a break.  Indulge.  Do something that makes you happy - and this is important - **as soon as you can.**  Every second you spend depressed is another second you could spend being... well, happy!

Next time you feel down, just do one simple thing - **fight back.**  You're worth it - remember that.",8,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dimey/depression_is_an_illness/,1285387100

Get a dog.

You become responsible for another living being.  You can't oversleep - you have to walk your dog.  You can't hide inside all day - you have to take your dog out at some point.  You can't avoid conversations with strangers - a happy dog on a leash is an instant conversation starter.

djlp8,depression,nodrive,I've lost the will to live (but I'm not suicidal),"I've never experienced this kind of feeling before so I'm assuming its depression. I guess a little background will help.  

I'm a 21 year old college student currently going to school full time and working two jobs. I love school, but I hate both of my jobs. But I can't quit them because both of them pertains to my future career and I wouldn't be able to pay rent if I quit. These days I find myself asking if this is all there is to life. I had relationships and hobbies and I have a great family (just in another country), so I don't think anything is missing from my life. I'm just weary of the future. I absolutely despise working. I am interning at a law firm and teaching at my college's tutoring center, so they aren't menial jobs, but I dread going to work. I have pretty awesome co-workers too. So I don't even know why I hate work even the smell of both places makes me sick. The thing is I know I'll have to work for the rest of my life, so I'm beginning to think maybe I'll feel down all my life. And if that is all there is to life, except for times of temporary happiness, why should I live? I'm beginning to see why people become religious. 

To most of you, I suppose this will sound silly. I thought so too at first, but I can't control it. I realize there are many many people who are in much worse situations than I am and I feel like a cry baby. But again, I can't seem to control it. I'm apathetic about everything and I'm always tired for no reason. I have fleeting thoughts of suicide, but I dismiss them as quickly as they enter my head. So I think I'm okay in that department.

I'm a 19yr old male, college sophomore at a decent university, and have had depression for 5+ years now. For the few 3 years I tried to manage it myself, which resulted in a few suicide attempts, two of which I should have been hospitalized but refused to tell anyone. 

My freshmen year of college through support of friends I finally got on medication(lexapro) and counselling. I hated both and found myself lying to the doctors just to get out of it. After that my grades dropped dramatically, to the point where I had to medically withdraw from college part of the way through the spring semester to save my gpa. After returning home I got much better, due to almost no stress. My parents didn't know the reasons for my withdrawal, but accepted that it would help my GPA. Over the summer through work I met an awesome girl who quite a bit younger (3 years). It was the best time of my life, I've never been so happy. I know were both young, and the whole love this is thrown around a lot at our age, but I can truly said I was in love with her, and it made everyday amazing. Her parents hated the idea that I was so much older, which caused stress on all of us.

Currently:
Me and the girlfriend broke up a few weeks ago due to the strain our relationship was causing between her and her parents. We decided to remain best friends, and still plan on possibly trying it again when she leaves for college, but thats far away. It's been a major emotional blow for me, but I know it needs to happen. 

Before we broke up I started to notice the same problems I had last year returning. I can't sleep, and can't get out of bed, which is already starting to negatively affect my grades. I like my major(computer engineering) and while the math is hard, I can usually figure everything out after I have some help. I just don't know what the problem is. 

I do have a very good job for a college student (geek squad at best buy, not happy about it but the money and hours are awesome) and it's the only time I can just completely forget everything and do what I enjoy doing: working on computers.

I decided I'm going to try medication again, calling to doctor tomorrow morning if I can get over the anxiety of actually making the call. I'm not sure about the counseling. I hate the idea of talking to someone who is getting paid to listen to my problems, while they try to make it seem personal, it doesn't at all, and never seemed to help at all.

I guess I'm basically just asking for advice as to what to do about this whole situation. My grades are dropping, I miss having my girlfriend to talk to and care about every night, and work seems to be the only thing keeping my mind off my problems.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dju2c/rdepression_youve_helped_me_before_lets_try_it/,1285649217
djuf7,depression,NeedToGetOnTrack,"I'm in a difficult situation in my life, no idea what to do","Basically, I'm an 18 year old high school grad (returning for a victory lap), but I need to actually get my shit together. I'm not a dumb kid or anything, in fact I was in a gifted program from grades 6-10, and I've been able to coast on smarts for most of my academic career with roughly a 70% average. I haven't had a real job aside from 2 days' temp work in a bakery, but I've applied for at least 50 jobs since I turned 16... No takers.

Anyways, I'm sure you're probably wondering why I'm taking the time to share this with you all, thanks for sticking around so far. Life at my house sucks, my parents are too stressed out between work/my sister being a fuckup herself/my own shortcomings, and as a result, we barely talk or in the case of me and my dad, have very little to talk about when we do speak. I'm not going to get into my pipe dream of moving out anytime soon, because that would take a job, a positive attitude, and motivation (I lack all of these things), though I'd love to be anywhere but in my house.

I don't find myself hungry very often, and as a result probably eat on average 1-2 times per day. In Feb. 2008 I was about 200 lbs, now I'm 165 because of the lack of eating and constant stress/nervousness (when I say nervousness, I mean always worrying what others think, constant nailbiting, etc.)

Anyways, I've come to the conclusion that I want to own my own food establishment (greasy spoon/hangout sort of place, I'm sure one you went to and enjoyed comes to mind) or a clothing store for some of the stuff I wear (LRG, Nomis, Volcom etc.) but have most of my high school credits in arts-based courses, with a few business ones in the lower half my top 6 marks (what universities are looking for, though after my victory lap those business marks will probably be out of my top 6). I went 0/6 last year in applications and don't want it to happen again. The university I want to go to has awesome programs, a great campus, and my best friends attend school both there and 15 minutes away.

I'm looking for any kind of advice or wellness tips that you fine folks may have, I've been told my behaviour is reminiscent of teen depression, but I haven't taken the steps to check that out.

Anyways, how do you all get through the daily grind? It's tough for me, especially knowing I've got the tools to pull it all off but just don't. Between the laziness/lack of motivation, there just seems like there's so much stuff out there in the world, it's kind of intimidating.

**tl;dr**

I'm lazy, possibly depressed, and need to get my life together so I can go to school at an awesome place and have a sweet job, what tips/advice do you have?

**EDIT**

Thanks for the upvotes, even if you don't have any tips or whatever it's nice to know that someone read it over :)",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/djuf7/im_in_a_difficult_situation_in_my_life_no_idea/,1285650982
djuh4,depression,depressionalt,"Depersonalization, depression, anxiety. Help a 
longtime lurker out please?","This is my new alt sn, as I have too many things connected to my other username, so pardon my supposed newness.

I've been working with depression and its myriad accompanying factors for several years now. I stopped seeing a counselor in Mayish when I graduated and moved away from where I got my degree. I've moved to a new city, had a lot of life stressors (like cancer scares, lack of understanding about parking, new job, event cancellations due to gas leak, money worries, among other things), and I'm slipping back down again. I'm experiencing moderate depersonalization- I'm not connected with my emotions, ""I"" seem further back in my head than my eyes, creating a weird tunnel vision effect, I've been sleeping too much or not enough, I can't tell if I am hungry or sick or tired, having trouble focusing my eyes on anything, etc on top of the depressive thoughts that bubble thru the depersonalization-like isolation and the lack of care about self well being and the return to smoking and nail biting and so on.

I've tried to get into counseling, but I've called several places and either they've moved and are too far, don't have after office hours appointments, don't have appointments open for mood disorders at all, or don't get back to me. On top of this, I am really scared of doctors. Some people are scared of spiders, some of snakes, some of clowns, I flip the fuck out about doctors. This stems from some really poor treatment by doctors regarding psych care and gynocological care in my past. I know I need to see them, I just get really anxious and cry a lot beforehand (sometimes during), and I get really reluctant to try to contact them. 

I've looked for online chats, but I really can't commit enough to anything to create a login, and I knew reddit's was easy and quick. It may be worth noting that I have a thyroid hormone problem that is still as yet undiagnosed and endocrinologists don't seem too concerned by my weight, depression, passy-outtyness, and cysts in my thyroid- at least, that's what ""come back in 6 months and get some bloodwork done"" means to me. I know that it can affect mood problems, thus the mention.

I don't fucking know what I'm doing. I don't know what to do. I need to get shit done, and I just fucking stare at the air in front of my face. I don't even have friends in the city. I don't know how to make friends outside of school. There are too many sentences starting with ""I"" in this post.

dkbaj,depression,jrocknpop,Think I'm hitting a spiral. Need some advice.,"I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression at 12 and it's been a problem that persists and persists and inhibits me daily.  It's a conscious struggle for me to be like everyone else and be motivated and interact, which is ironic because my personality type is ENTP haha.

Recently I left my fiance, we'd been together 6 years, long story short the impetus was caused by her cheating on me.  When I left her I felt good, I was disappointed, a bit sad, a bit angry, but overall felt in high hopes for the future.

The next two weeks I'd spent getting hammered and partying, and when I say hammered I mean 3 bottles of liquor + per night hammered. It got so bad that I lost some important work documents, and due to privacy issues, I was sacked.

My ex and I still talk, but where she is going on dates and having her fun in the sack I havn't been able to keep up with her.

All of a sudden I feel extremely depressed, in a way I havn't felt in over a year, I don't feel wanted by anyone, I don't feel loved, when people talk to me they annoy me, when they don't I wish they'd speak to me.  Utter hopelessness has taken over and no matter what I try to do it doesn't go away.

I really, really need some advice on what to do.  I am one who usually deals with these things alone but they've overwhelmed me this time. Too much all at once I think.",4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dkbaj/think_im_hitting_a_spiral_need_some_advice/,1285729615

I started feeling shit over a year ago, maybe two, and I only finally went to the doctor recently. Without really asking me that many questions about myself my doctorprescribed Lexapro quite readily. His readiness, coupled with my doubts about his diagnosis, have made me apprehensive to starting treatment. 

Also, as an aside is it possible to combat either situation without drugs? I smoked about an ounce of cannabis per week for two years, (which has also increased my fears about schizophrenia) so I'm trying to get off *all* drugs entirely. 

I'm really not sure when I started to feel upset.  I have no motivation and all the symptoms related to depression... Since then, I haven't been able to think clearly, or act ""myself"". I feel like I've lost my ability to think clearly too (I seem to match every symptom of thought disorder, which I read was a symptom of schizophrenia). I don't have any hallucinations, nor hear controlling voices. I did a few online tests however, and they all returned schizophrenic as my biggest response. I'm not really good at writing about myself I'm not sure exactly how to explain how I feel... and behave.

dkhai,depression,throwaway7326,Need some advice on whether to go to a doctor or not.,"Im 16 and i'm in the UK, England to be exact. 

Just to give a little backstory, i have been pretty depressed for about three years now. I'm not sure if 'depression' is the right word, which is one of the reasons i want to go to the doctors. Anyway, i feel really down almost all of the time, i also seem to have random mood spikes and although this might just sound like general teenage behaviour it's alot more extreme. For example when i am in a bad place i will ocaisionally hyperventilate, cry and just sit in my room on the floor. I think this are panic/anxiety attacks but i'm not sure. I have these from time to time (Perhaps once a month, sometimes more) and i have had two in public places. One was with one of my friends and nothing was said to trigger it, and another was at a festival after seeing one of my ex girlfriends. Later that same day i ended up standing over a bridge trying to make myself jump (I was alone here) and of course i didn't but i constantly have these suicidal thought but thankfully wimp out at the last moment. It is hard for me to pinpoint exactly what it is that is making me feel so bad and what i should do about it if anything. I don't struggle to make friends, i do well at college, but life for me just seems extremely lacking.

Anyway, i told my bestfriend how i have been feeling recently (I don't generally like sharing my feelings but i thought this was worth it) and she suggested that i go to a doctor as she was worried about me (I'm worried about me too, of course).

So my question is: Should i go to a doctor? If so, how do i go to the doctor without my parents knowing? What sort of things will happen while i'm there? And how likely is it that he will prescribe me anti depressants, because i'm not sure if i really want to be drugged up. Also how do they react to things like this?

Alot of questions but i'm kind of confused. If you need more information just ask.",4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dkhai/need_some_advice_on_whether_to_go_to_a_doctor_or/,1285765100
dkl0u,depression,Prezombie,Trying to improve life will lose what little I have.,"I was forced to move away from the USA when I was 16, and now I live on the edge of Tartu, Estonia. Never got to finish high school, and there's no jobs or classes available here for someone who doesn't know Estonian, which I've tried repeatedly to learn, and failed miserably. Even if I did manage to learn, the minimum wage is less than two dollars an hour.

On the other hand, I still have my room in my parent's house, with good meals and internet, but they're so cheap I don't see any money for the excessive amount of chores I do for them. If I leave, I need money, meaning I need a job, meaning I need credentials, meaning I need to move somewhere that has a school that teaches in English. 

No credentials, no money, no experience with life outside, while inside I'm getting enough food not to starve, and a room with internet for free. The only fix I can find is moving away, but then I need to find a job, and a place to live simultaneously and instantly to have a situation even remotely as good as where I am in the short term.

dks7v,depression,doesmurdersleep,I just don't know-,"I hope this doesn't get too wordy.  I just don't know anything most days.  I've been depressed for a very long time, I guess I should break it down a little.  I feel like, even as a child of six years I was dealing with the crushing blow of existentialism and my part or role in the universe.  There were nights I cried in the hallway at age six, out to some mysterious benefactor in the sky about all the problems.  

""Why does nobody like me?""
""Why do I have no friends...?"" 
""What is my purpose?"" 
""Where is happiness?""

I still believe in a sort of God, but these days whatever it is should be so abstract the word God becomes meaningless to apply towards whatever it is.  To this day I have received no answer.  I sniffled, I picked myself up, and put one foot ahead of the other.  

I feel often times, I have made too many mistakes.  Too many mistakes that I just don't know how to fix and there is not enough time.  I could literally list them all, all the events in my life that lead up to me being 24 years old and being completely burnt out; best friend dying, failing out of high school, losing every single friend (completely honest, if you could even call them friends), a pitiful family that is only tied by blood.  It really only scratches the surface.  Albeit, I have managed a few successes; receiving my GED certification, starting college—both of which were in this very same year—maintaining a dreadful boring job, mostly because I have to.  When I passed my GED and I stated I was going to college, nobody in the immediate household cared.  I got a pat on a back and a reminder the rent is due.  Big help family has ever been.  Rent is about 70% of the money I make from my (dead end) job.  I can only afford one class this semester, and probably only 2-3 classes if possible, even if I were to get student loans. 

Also I just feel dumb again, once I am back in school.  Like I just don't belong.  Even for just one class, and its an English class!  Something I was at least decent at in high school.  

...I've just been horribly depressed, lonely, for so long.  It's beginning to seem like a fact of nature: ""People are islands unto themselves.""  Just like the sun rises and earth rotates.  

I've had maybe two relationships in my life and both of those failed, due to distance, due to other things...  I don't even know if I am capable of reciprocating real love anymore.  I can say the words, even put 'emotion' behind them.  I mean, honestly, I don't even care if my father or mother or brothers passed away right now.  Then again, I don't think they'd care too much either if I hit the bucket.  I don't think I see human beings as human beings anymore. 

Going back, I'm not doing too well in college, even if its only one class.  I can't seem to focus, and understand even the logistics of grammar, or at least when it comes to presenting proper exercises.  If I am having problems in a subject I use to be considered good in, what is going to happen when I get to math?  If I can even afford to keep up going to college.  I think maybe its because I am pulling full time hours at my dead end Grocery Store job, and it could possibly be, but then how else am I going to pay the rent that my family forces upon me?  

I just don't know what to do anymore.  I hate this place my family moved to, I hate the people where we came from.  I don't feel at home within' my own family.  I don't have any friends since they ditched me even before moving here, and I haven't made any real lasting relationships since living here two years.  I don't have the money to go out, eat out.  If I could move I would, but I have nowhere to go.  Nor the money to support myself, even if it was a shared apartment found off of craigslist. 

To a lesser degree, I don't know what I want anymore.  What I want to be, what I want to do.  Who I should even be?  I thought I was on the right track getting my GED, getting my ass in college.  Even if my own family doesn't give a damn.  Every step I take seems like another two steps back.  I can't even live a life due to monetary constraints or have hobbies.  I'm pretty much at the quarter part of my life, the pinnacle position where the opportunities of life should be presenting themselves, but all I see is closed doors. 

I tried to start up a hobby with photography.  I lurked the subreddit for roughly a year, and saved up all my money and bought a DSLR.  I probably only gone out on shootouts twice.  I don't feel inspired by anything.  When I look up on flickr for inspiration of what photographs people take around my area, its all the same, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, ocean, maybe a few model photographs; Florida doesn't inspire. 

In the past couple weeks, all I can manage is thinking about dying, or of trying to scrounge up so money to buy a motorcycle—to drive off and never be heard from again.  I don't like it here—in Florida—or anywhere.  I don't have a home.  I only have two friends, who are 2 hours away, and 2000 miles away respectively.  I hate my job.  So much anger at my family for never helping and always taking.  I am tired of being lonely, yet loneliness is all I know.  I don't even feel like a human being anymore. 

In so many ways, I am still that young little boy.  Crying out to father be it God or something entirely else, demanding answers.  Demanding reason for this bullshit of a reality.  Except that is a lie.  I don't care anymore, I just want to be gone—off on a motorcycle—retired in Alaska far from civilization—dead. 

I just don't understand anything anymore and it's been that way for a long time.  ",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dks7v/i_just_dont_know/,1285809845

I'm struggling through a hard phase of depression.  It almost feels like I don't want to get better, that I'm comfortable in this sad state of mind because it is what i'm comfortable with.

The only thing that makes me happy is playing starcraft 2.  I have neglected my hygiene, stopped shaving, drinking tons of coke coupled with not brushing my teeth has left numerous cavities and tooth aches.  I don't care about my physical appearance anymore, even when I go ut.   I don't care about my acne.

I've been ono anti-depressants SSRIs (celexor) for about a year.  Weened off of them at the end of the summer and was doing great, and then shit hit the fan and started back on them after about two months off.  

I guess I started to get really depressed again when I started playing too much starcraft, but not sure if the game is to blame.  I've had bad periods of depression and I've come out of them before, one of the worst I came out of with the help of the SSRI, but the medication dosn't seem to be doing anything this time.  

I have scheduled a counseling visit with my schools free counseling service but the guy I want to see is all booked up.  He specializes in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Training) and addictions so I think he can help.  I was seeing one therapist there for a while now, but whenever I think of seeing him again I just get really turned down.  Not sure because he seemed to work great for me, but it just dosnt seem like he cares about me.

I have trouble getting out of bed everyday.  I have a great job for my age ( currently 20) and go to school full time so am relatively busy.  This past month I've been skipping school and work and it's starting to catch up to me.  I'm about to drop one class and take a test I haven't studied for tomorrow.   I just don't want to do anything but play starcraft.  It is the only thing that makes me happy.  I love the community I play with, the adrenaline rush I get from playing the game, and everything about it.  I love getting good at the game, reading about strategies, and watching pro-videos.  I just don't want to stop.

It's gotten so bad I tried to uninstall to help with my problems but I only lasted 3 days.  A few weeks later I uninstalled and broke the discs, but I managed to just install online a day later.  I keep telling myself I'm going to go to the gym and work out but I never do.

I can feel my body falling apart, I order pizza about 2-3 times a week because of shear laziness, and I don't get any exerscise.  I'm not outside much and i'm gaining some fat.

I know the steps to get happier, i just can't take the first step.  It's almost like I enjoy being depressed, I like the comfort of it.  Here's what I should be doing
-healthy diet
-exerscise
-sun
-social contact
-sleep schedule
-counseling

It feels better getting these off my chest, but I don't know what to do.  My parents are informed, but they live far away and can't really do anything about it.  I'm hesitant to try new medication, just because I don't want to mix a bunch of chemicals.  

Any advise is appreciated.

dky6h,depression,StrayFromThePath,"Feel like I'm wasting my life, but don't know what to do.","As I'm sitting here, it's 3am. Another night on the computer. I feel like this is my life and I'm wasting it. What I'm supposed to be doing with it I don't know. I am going to school, a community college, but I'm not really learning anything. I'm just trying to make up for my shitty high school performance so I can get into a real college. I don't really count high school 2.0 as doing something with my life. When I get home I basically either read a book or sit at the computer. 

I don't really have a social life because my friends from high school were going off in a different direction with their lives. They just wanted to be kids still. Every day it's, get high and play xbox. That gets old real fast. None of them have ever even picked up a book nor could they form an opinion on anything. Whatever, they were just morons and I was looking for something more. So the only person I have is someone I met playing an MMO that I call regularly. Which is great, but I'm still lacking that physical social interaction.

So I guess my point is, I'm in my second year of college and have no idea of what I want to do and I feel kind of pressured because I did some dumb shit when I was 17 and couldn't go to college until I was 20. So I'm already behind. And I don't have any friends that share my same interests.

Yes, I'm depressed…I'm betting you assumed as much.  I suppose my reason for this post is simply to vent as I don't really have anyone I can talk to who truly understands where I'm coming from.  I've read many posts in this subreddit and a lot of you seem to be experiencing similar things so hopefully this won't fall upon deaf ears.

I have a severe case of OCD which I believe triggered my depression/anxiety at a very young age.  I've seen countless doctors and tried dozens of medications but nothing seemed to work and even if I felt the tinniest bit of relief the side affects were more than enough to convince me to stop.  So here I am, unmedicated and depressed to the point that I don't want to be alive.  Life is fucking painful, I feel as though I have a lead weight in my gut most days and all I have to help reduce that feeling is cannabis, which I've stopped using.  The thought of having a family and a normal job once seemed like the natural path I would take in life but now it's nothing more than a pipe dream.  I can't imagine purposely passing on my genes to another human being so they can deal with the same thing I am.  After all, a number of my relatives have similar problems so I know it's genetically likely this is not simply an irrational fear.

As it stands right now I have very little to live for.  I got laid off from work so now my days blend together and have zero structure.  I sleep maybe 2-3 hours a night and spend my days sitting on the couch trying to get rid of the crippling anxiety.  The rare occasions when I go out with friends only result in making me feel like a loser.  Suicide is on my mind quite frequently and the saddest part of this is that my only reason for dismissing the notion is because of how it would make my parents feel.

I've been living with the idea that my life is basically already over and I'm just waiting for the ""right"" time to cash in my chips.  It's hard to get ambitious about anything when you aren't planning on being around much longer.  I just feel so alone in the world and desperately need to know that things can get better but I've also been dealing with this for years and know this is near impossible.  I can't stop thinking about myself in 10 years time…picturing myself as a shut in with no friends or money.  It's taken me a long time to realize that all my problems are my fault.  I should have gotten the help I needed when it would have worked.  Now all I feel is regret and pain.

dlewt,depression,imreallynotsure,"I wrote this late at night, I wasn't stable nor am I especially stable now.  What's wrong with me?","I'm posting this here because I'm not sure where else to post it.  I need people to read it and tell me what's wrong with me.  I've been diagnosed with ADHD-I, OCD, an anxiety disorder that has not been specified lately, and I have a history of depression.  It comes every now and again and when I wrote this I was crying for parts.  Out of sadness, hopelessness, and desperation I guess.  So many have It so much worse than I do.  I'm not especially suicidal, I mean that I doubt I'll actually kill myself any time soon.  But rarely is there a day where I don't resist the urge to throw myself off a bridge or think about cutting my wrist or the like.  I just need to know what to think.  Please try to help, though I'm not even sure what I'm asking for.  
     I wrote this late at night a few days ago while intending to write my second essay of the night.  I'll be checking this and I'll try to clarify if there's any confusion.  This is what I wrote with no corrections for spelling or grammer:


When I was younger I knew I would be something great.  I’m not even sure what I am anymore.  I want a purpose.  I miss having a purpose.  Anything.  Nothing really makes me happy anymore.  I want to say that’s a lie.  I want to say I’m just saying that.  I honestly don’t know if it’s true.  I don’t trust my own mind enough to be sure.  I think I’m exaggerating.  But I can’t prove that.  How would I?  Part of me thinks that I exaggerate all of my symptoms to inspire pity.  Not just from others but from myself.  Maybe even more from myself than anyone.  I never know what to think anymore.  I’m manipulative without wanting to be.  I don’t control myself anymore.  It’s like I live in a set frame of mind during the day, and at night the veneer fades and I’m this again.  This miserable wreck.  I know when I read this in the morning that I’ll disregard it.  I don’t know why I change so much from day to night.  It’s horrible.  I don’t know who I am.  Which of these people is me?  Which mindset?  What are my values?  My goals?  I know I should care and that I should work, but I don’t, and I don’t know why.  Oh how I want to just be able to work.  The lorazepam should have kicked in by now I think.  I’m not sure when I took it.  My mood is certainly not good, but I feel like I’m holding myself under right now.  Like I could pull myself out of this depressed state at any moment.  I think the depressed state is fading now, maybe the lorazepam is kicking in.  I’m not sure if I want to leave it.  At least sadness was something.  Everything seemed to be at least visible.  More lucid.  I understood that I was, that I am two different people.  This thought that seemed so logical a few moments ago now seems less valid.  I knew it would be this way.  I knew I would blow it off.  I’m clinging to it in my mind.  I’m trying…  My mind is making it hard to remember what it was I was so concerned with a few seconds ago.  Although I made no conscious effort to push the thought away, it was pulled from consuming my mind to the point I’m at now, barely able to remember what it was.  “I am two people.”  Thinking that phrase elicits a pang of sadness with some residual but less strong.  It’s not the same as it was. WHAT DO I WANT AND WHO AM I?  I did not feel as though my current ‘plane’ of consciousness typed that.  It was as though something in me, below this plane, told me to.   I’m not sure I’m not making this up.  Maybe I’m trying to appear interesting.  I worry that I may only be pretending to think that I’m pretending.  I convince myself that that is how it is and then it is so.  Something of my own creation.  I’m not sure if I mean that.  Do I mean that.  Something in me just said something:  “get out”  I think that one was me making it up to fill space.  But there was something but my mind is preventing me from recalling the phrase.  I worry I make up that voice.  The one on the lower plane, the other me (I may or may not mean the dame other me as before) could just be me making it up.  Or it could be a cry for help.  I don’t know.  Now something in me wants me to type ”help” in all caps.  I;m not sure wheather it’s a genuine call for help or part of me trying to fake it to debase the actual times that voice speaks up so I’ll no longer listen to it because I’ll assume it’s a hoax concocted by myself for some reason I can’t explain.  This is why I question myself.  This is why I say I don’t know my own motivations.  I don’t know who I am.  I don’t.   I need help.  But I have no way of explaining this to someone.  Maybe what I’ve typed will help.  Maybe.  Part of me tells me to write those one word sentences in for style.  This is one of those things that makes me thing that the way I portray many of my own problems is insincere as a result of the same thing that made me type those one word sentences.  I hear a woman’s voice screaming, “HELP ME” in my head.  It was only there for a few moments.  I only heard it a few times.

I woke ~8am for work today.
~9 I had a 3shot espresso
~12 I had a medium mocha (3shots)
On my way to my psych discussion I ate  a chicken croissant
Had a sip of a mt dew in my dorm.
I had a largish dinner. Spinach with French (plate).  French fries, sesae rice and 2 corndogs. Milk and apple juice to drink.
Mocha at espresso expose afterwards., must have been 7:30
Finished that not sure when.  Mt dew afterwards.  Drank a peace tea 2-4:30 I would think. Not sure.  I’m at the present.  I’m going to set an alarm and try to write the paper when I get up.  This was typed from 4-5am I believe.  It is currently 5:05 and I remember starting shortly before or after 4 though I could be mistaken.  But I believe that is a semi reliable recollection.
I really need help.

dlhvg,depression,Poison1990,Is meditation a legitimate treatment for depression?,"Today I went to an assessment session to see if I could get counselling. 
I was advised to read some self help books and listen to the CDs in order to teach myself how to meditate. 

I'm a bit of a sceptic when it comes to stuff like that. I was kind of disappointed that I was just palmed off to published experts who want me to meditate. 

Should this treatment be taken seriously?

has it helped anyone else who wasn't taking any other form of treatment at the time?

Am I being closed minded by thinking sitting by myself and thinking is not going to be an effective treatment for my depression?

I hate to question people whose job it is to help people in situations like myself but it seemed like a bit of a lame cop out, and nothing in comparison to getting proper counselling.",39,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dlhvg/is_meditation_a_legitimate_treatment_for/,1285942040
dlnyp,depression,noobinneed,I'm in a lot of trouble right now,"Nothing life threatening, just in a panic. And it's been going on for so long, I built a cloud over my head for months, maybe even years to pretend everything was going all right. I'm still in denial to the point where right now I decided to take a walk and passed by the library where I am writing this. I don't know who to talk to about it, and Reddit being a big part of my life, I decided to just write this post and see what would happen. I just want to hide right now from RL people and not worry about the stress that they give me, but I think I've done that too long.

This weekend, I may have made a huge mistake. I'm trying really hard to cover it up by playing video games, but for some reason the guilt built up and I'm now at a library seeking anonymous help because I'm too pathetic to talk to anyone I know.

I am a compulsive liar, and I don't want to be this way anymore.
I have so many family issues. It's to the point where at any second now, I can be disowned by my parents and living on the streets,
I have a girlfriend who I love and she loves me, but she can do so much better than me and I wonder why she even talks to me in the first place. She doesn't know my whole situation, because I'm afraid if she knew, I'll never again see her again. Shes the only reason why I wake up in the morning. It's complicated.
My friends are non-existent. We only talk about video games and movies, and that's about it. I can't remember the last time one of them just called me up to say Hi. Being a guy, I guess thats not exactly guy convo, but heck! I need that stuff.

We are in our mid twenties. He is back in school and is part of a small, close knit major. Students work in close proximity on projects, often until the wee hours. I graduated last year from that department. 

Today he told me that he was surprised by the lack of guys in his classes. So I asked him about the girls. Actually, I interrogated him about the girls. They are gorgeous. They are young. And they are smart. 

I know he is going to leave me this year. Why wouldn't he?

dluug,depression,CallmeJack,:(,"I've been contemplating suicide for a while now but I don't think I would ever do it. I'm by nature a fun loving person and I love inspiring other people but I can't get a grip on my own life. I've been hitting an extremely rough patch in my life. I am currently a student though I've been to few of my classes. I feel like a leech on my friends. What has really been troubling me is that I don't know how to motivate myself. At school, I've been doing shit like smoke weed and play World of Warcraft instead of going to class and I know that's not a future I want to create for myself. I know that if my parents knew that I already failed a class this year to to attendance issues and miscommunication they would be disappointed which in turn would make me even more so...even if they were not I'd be upset with myself. It's 5 AM and I should be asleep for parents weekend but I can't force myself to sleep. I cannot make myself feel like I should study. I have all these things, opportunities, possessions and ""friends"". I'm not rich at all but I got into a decent school and I could have a future in something but I cannot motivate myself. I feel so lost and there is no one around who I believe can help me not feel like shit. I have a lot more but, I don't know. I really just wish I could be a more functioning part of society. I don't need you to cheer me up. I just want someone to talk to. I don't have a hard life, I just make it hard for myself. How can I stop being self-depricative?

dm3xt,depression,staaic,I'm posting this while I'm a bit stable.,"A few times a week I get extremely depressed about life. For the most part I'm moderately depressed. I never feel truly happy at any time. During my moderately depressed stages, like I am now, I feel like a dumbass for being depressed. I feel like a self-centered dumbass for writing this here, but I'm forcing myself because I'm tired of it.

This has been getting worse and worse for the past few years now, and I'm only 16. I don't do any illegal drugs/alcohol or anything, even weed. I do well in school(mostly A's, and a few B's here and there), although I've started to not care about school more and more with each passing week. This whole post is just the tip of the iceberg for me. There's way too many problems with me to write everything in this post.

I have no friends that I communicate outside of school with. I try making friends in school, but as soon as they suggest something to do outside of school, I decline, most of the time making up some excuse. I have a lot of time to think about why I do the things I do, most of the time trying to figure out why I ended up this way. I figure the reason I decline is because I don't know how to act, what to wear, what to do. I also don't want to go through asking my parents to go out, because I'm sure I'll get a ton of questions about who I'm going with, etc, because I never go out. 

I'm extremely private and self-conscious. I've tried not giving a shit, but not giving a shit has made me even worse during my extremely depressed stages. I have a slight speech impediment, which makes me not want to talk to people as much. This makes making friends even harder. Once I start talking to someone, I have nothing to talk to them about, outside of school work. I don't have any gaming systems, I don't watch sports, and since I'm extremely self conscious, I don't like to talk about music, fearing...something; I don't even know what I fear. I do nothing but, school -&gt; internet -&gt; sleep -&gt; repeat. 

I can't get help. If I talk to one of my parents, I don't want them to think they screwed up, or that I screwed up and I'm worthless(even though I'm going to get a ton of responses like, 'YOU'RE NOT!'). I really really want to get some help. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. I started going into an extreme depression stage(I'm in one right now) and I can't read this over again to make it make sense.

dmfg8,depression,R_Y_N,My girlfriend is depressed... Advice?,"My girlfriend of 10 seasons has been depressed for awhile now (~3 solid months, on and off for the past year) and I don't know what to do.

Some important notes: We're both 19. She is in her sophomore year at her dream university with a high GPA that will likely get her in the upper division nursing that she wants. She gets super stressed by it. We lived together the first year but very lucrative (quadrupling my income) work took me away in May six hours away where I see her twice ever three months for a weekend.

She talks fairly freely of suicide. Her gears are stripped to where she will be fine funloving and then talking of suicide within 30 minutes. She sees a therapist and mentioned maybe seeing a psychiatrist which I strongly advocate. She feels ashamed of the chance of being ""crazy"". The largest thing is the stress. I hear things from her like ""life isn't worth it"". But I commonly hear of stress and stress and stress.

Now I'm a fairly optimistic, upbeat, happy guy. I've been beaten down a lot but I always get back up. I make do with nothing like it's everything, thankful for the smallest of things, and fairly carefree. I feel like most of this is silly, but I see that to her it's so serious. The problem is I can't relate. All I end up doing is being a shoulder to cry on, that phone call every day, that random fun text message. When I visit we have an amazing time. I take her out, we have great sex (used to be bad, but good lube and experimenting fixed that for her), we laugh and shout and wild about. She breaks down now and then. But I also encourage professional help since she mentioned it. I don't know what to say or what to do. I feel like the bomb is getting closer and closer to blowing.

I love this girl so much, and when she mentions suicide it's a huge blow to me. One of the few things that completely floor me.

dmgmd,depression,[deleted],Went on a weekend trip to visit a girl. Ended in disappointment. ,"I feel like I just need someone to talk to. Or someone to listen. I guess I've been struggling with some mild depression for a few years now. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. I find that it depends heavily on what's going on in my life. When things start going badly or I get stressed out, I feel like everything just builds up and I go downhill.

This past week was bad for me. I'm a senior in college and I'm starting to freak out about graduation and finding a job (even though it's not until April). First off, last week was our career fair at our school (where companies come to recruit for 2 days) and it was really stressful thinking that I had to find a career from this. Also, none of the companies I submitted my resume to have gotten back to me. Second, my grandfather died. My mom didn't have a great relationship with him (especially in the past few years) and so I wasn't very close to him. But it's still weird. He's really the first person close to me that I've lost, and I'm not sure how to react it. I haven't really yet. 

Third, and most influential, I went to visit a girl I had a romantic interest in over this past weekend. We met over the summer and there was instant attraction. I really like her. She's cute and fun and outgoing and just generally awesome to be around. We go to different schools, and I made plans a few weeks ago to visit her. I was literally counting down the days until Thursday when I went to see her. And it was a complete let down. Instead of a joyous, fun reunion from the summer, I kind of felt like a second thought to her. I spent a lot of time alone in her apartment while she went to do things (such as preparing for a concert she planned, doing homework / going to class, and work). Even when we went out to parties, she seemed to ignore me. She'd introduce me to someone and then go and talk to them, leaving me standing alone. Just not what I expected. The last straw was today. I worked hard to plan my flights so that I'd leave late in the day, giving us a full Sunday together. Except she scheduled a work shift and ""couldn't switch it"" (although it didn't seem like she tried very hard). So as I mentioned above, I was left sitting in her apartment alone today, killing time until I had to call a cab to get to the airport.

So basically, something that was supposed to be a fun getaway turned into something completely depressing. I didn't know what to expect from this summer fling, especially because it was long distance, but it's just a shock that the weekend turned out like this. Why would she have encouraged me to visit if she didn't really want to see me?

So right now my confidence is shot. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. My classes are just getting more and more intense and I'll soon have to lock myself in the library most days after class. The weather is getting cold and the days shorter. This one girl I had an interest in, that I looked forward to talking to each night, is seemingly out of the picture. I've had this type of feeling before, but I'm not sure what to do to help it. Usually I just try to grind through it. I just feel lethargic and unmotivated. Like nothing would be worth my time.

dmtrb,depression,Buddy_Jesus,What has worked for me.,"Hey guys. I've been watching this subreddit for awhile and I haven't seen any posts on this topic. I'm one of the many out there who don't have insurance. I don't have a lot of options when it comes to talking to someone, or getting meds to help treat my depression. About 6 months ago I started taking St. John's Wort. It's not expensive, and you can find it in just about any pharmacy. The first month taking it I didn't notice much, but during the second month I realized that I was feeling better, more energetic, and even though my life has basically fallen apart over the last 4 months I am able to deal with things and be realistic. I still have bad days, but once I realize that it is just a bad day I am usually able to overcome my negativity for the most part. I also take 5-HTP along with the St. John's Wort. I haven't tried separating the two to really test the efficacy of the 5-HTP, because I have been feeling good and I don't want to fuck things up for myself. I just wanted to let people know that there are options out there if you don't have insurance or can't afford to see someone, and that they do work. Maybe I'm a rare case, I don't know, but from what I've read St. John's Wort is widely regarded as being effective in treating clinical depression. Anybody else have a similar experience with this stuff, or know anything about them that we should hear about?

EDIT: I should clarify that I'm not suggesting this is a replacement for professional care. I'm merely saying that if you are out of options and cannot afford meds or to see a specialist that there is one last thing you can try. It's worked for me, that's all I know, and I will continue to use it until I can afford professional care.",4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dmtrb/what_has_worked_for_me/,1286232859
dmu0v,depression,[deleted],I am ready to fight this. But how can I get help with no medical insurance?,"Hello Reddit! 

I am a mid twenties black male, living in georgia. All my life i have felt something was wrong with me inside my head, and kept asking myself, ""whats wrong with me?"" After beating my self up (not literally) and asking EVERYONE for advice, id make progress but would always sink into panic attacks when certain thoughts about failure trigger a unsual breakdown.

 I had a nice job out of college and went to the psciatriast, and he diagonosed me with depression. I was taking medication and going to counseling once a week. 

When I took the medication, everything in my head was finally quite, all the irrational fears were gone. It allowed me to make some progress. but I felt like i was cheating because i didnt solve the problems my self. 

So i stop going and taking medication. was not a good choice. Things got hard again, was in a very stressful workplace (medical, 24/hr on call) and i got fired from my job.

Fast foward 2 years, I have a $9/hr job, but I have low stress, a foundation, and stability. I have lost some weight, became more independent. I have friendships that I have worked very hard to nurture, I have made it a priority to take care of myself, not to abuse my self, becuase I am as worthy as anyone else. But I have one stress trigger left that just brings me into unrealistic panic attacks, and its the fact that i have no significant other for over 2 years.

 I want to deal with it, but the panic attacks are so strong that I feel i cant move foward and I am wasting my time, there is no hope for me. but i know its a lie, and i refuse to feel like this. I know who i am and I am ready to come to the table and face whatever I got too. i want help, even if its medication treatment. 

But im kinda stuck at a low wage job right now that doesnt offer affordable medical insurance. I want another job, but i want to ""build myself up"" before I go to a higher stress, higher paying job. Are there any options for low income people suffering from depression?

We got a new rowing coach who hates me, and its making the whole thing miserable. Not going to wake up at 4:30 to have nothing but mean things said to me for 3 hours kthx. Work had previously been a good source of entertainment, but its getting to the point where the managers are bullying me. (Last night I'd been saying I wanted to go home (cuz i felt like shit/ hurt/ was upset because of rowing earlier in the day) and the manager was doing nothing but telling me that I should just quit and that I was the most annoying employee ever (we don't get along. Never have, never will) which I could brush off cuz he's an idiotic d-bag. But then when it was time for me to leave, a more senior manager who was there helping out tried to convince me to stay, and when I refused (because they'd both been, in general, douche bags to me all night), as I was walking out (after staying an extra 15 minutes) he said ""she doesn't know how much i'm going to make her pay for that later.""

dmxjg,depression,danny841,I don't know if I am depressed or not,"So what will follow is a long story of how my life in general has been for the last year.  I will add a tldr version at the bottom. 

A year ago I woke up to the sound of my father mercilessly beating my mom. This was nothing new to me because for over the previous five years he had beat her off and on for cheating on him. He was never a good man but he worked constantly and did provide for us. What surprised me this particular morning was the intensity with which he beat her. She suffered a concussion and various bruises and bumps as a result. Knowing that filing a police report would mean he would be thrown in jail or quit his job or stop supporting us, my mother and I moved into her mom's place and him with his mother. 

Flash forward to now and my home life at my grandmothers is just as much a wreck. I'm in my third year of community college and I'm struggling to decide if I even want to go (I'm horrible at everything and even my prospective major, English is something I just cannot do well in). I don't work so I have no reason to be doing bad or to feel any pressure. I just don't do shit and what I do is half assed.

My uncle (a 40+ deeply religious man with no job who has lived with my grandmother his whole life) has recently started getting mad at my mom for carrying on with another man while she receives support from my abusive father. To be clear my father still thinks the relationship could work. In any case he has started taking it out on me and I've yelled at him for doing so but it is no use, he just makes sarcastic comments to my grandmother behind my back. 

My grandmother is a whole different story. At least once a month she comes into my room and has me clean up and throw away some of my belongings because she says the house looks disgusting (it is spotless). She doesn't let me shower but once every three days, gets mad when my mom and I buy ""too many groceries"", and generally acts mean spirited to everyone. 

Up until recently I have felt no true signs of depression but hearing my creepy Norman Bates like uncle talk to me and my mom like this just set me over the edge. The past few days I haven't been able to eat much of anything, I have been waking up randomly (although my grandmother coming into my room telling me to clean up or leave doesn't help), my stomach hurts whenever I am home, I have had zero concentration in class, and I feel no interest in doing anything.  

Tldr: abusive dad, moved to grandmothers with my mom, home life still bad, may be depressed.

dmyzd,depression,asdgjhk,How do i find help?,"I'm struggling. I hurt my back about 3 months ago and have been living in constant pain. I've been getting a variety of treatment, but going from 20-25 miles per week to nothing has been damaging. Unable to exercise I have gone on a self-loathing eating binge where I've gained almost 20 pounds. I broke up with my long-time, long-distance girlfriend because...well I don't even remember why. It made sense at the time. I feel hopelessly lost at my job, in an ultra competitive industry where I can't move ahead despite my best efforts. I'm barely treading water. The worst part is I have this jokester, funny-guy persona that everyone expects from me and I can no longer even pretend to deliver. I just can't even fake it anymore. I don't know what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I've shut myself off from everyone and anyone who could feasible care about me.

I guess what I'm asking through this long winded diatribe is how do I take that first step towards getting better? I don't want to walk into some random doctors office; i don't want some indifferent fuck who doesn't know me or care about me to ask me vague questions.

dn4f9,depression,lordcheesus,I keep changing my mind about seeing a counsellor. Advice?,"Sorry in advance if this is long.

I've always felt the same way, so not being happy just seems normal to me, rather than seeming like a medical condition. A friend has recently pointed out that felling like crap and having anxiety attacks *this often* is not actually normal, and recommended that I get some help, but I'm really not sure.

The thing is, my home life is pretty erratic and depressing, and has been essentially since I was born. I think my anxiety and negative emotions are a reasonable response to my environment. I'm not sure if there's something wrong with me, like depression, or if I'm just reacting to the situation I'm in like a normal human being.

I do have a family history of depression, and as a young child I did attempt suicide, but there's been nothing dramatic for many years now. I still essentially feel the same, but it's not as if I am in any physical danger, or anything extreme is happening. Things are just mundane and flat. I lack drive to do anything, my friends all suddenly seem boring, and I find it hard to really give a shit about anything. Things aren't getting better, but it's not as if they are getting worse.

I've been thinking about going to see the counsellor at my university, but I keep changing my mind. While life just generally sucks for me, I don't feel as if I am in dire need of assistance. I'm sure there are lots of other people who are actually in danger, and I feel horrible thinking about taking time away from them. I also think that I'd feel silly going into the office and saying ""Hey, I feel all down and angsty"". It's a 'teenager thing' to get angsty, and I feel as though I'd come across as some pathetic teenager, desperate for attention, though lacking any real problems.

What would you recommend I do? How can I get myself more comfortable with the idea of therapy? And if I do woman-up and go to the counsellor, what are they likely to do? I don't talk to people about this kind of thing, so I don't know what I'll do if they want me to talk about it in-depth, and I also don't fancy the idea of someone suggesting that I take medication. A former colleague of mine started taking anti-depressants, and all was well until she tried to stop taking them, and she went nuts, for lack of a better word.

dnknr,depression,[deleted],"I am experienced with depression.  I know advice doesn't always help depressed people, but here's some anyway.","I just learned about r/depression.  I'm so glad it's here.

I have had experience with depression since I was 12 or 13, and I'm 36 now.  I have had a long history with the Black Eyed Dog.  I want to share with you some of my experiences and some things I've learned along the way.

I have suffered a lot over the years from this illness.  I missed a lot of valuable adolescent experiences and growth opportunities.  At the time I saw several reasons that this happened: they weren't worth my time, or I didn't have the energy, or they were associated with people I hated.  I wasn't until much later that I put the pieces together and realized that all this negativity had a root.

I'm still learning how to deal with it.  I don't consider myself an expert by any means, but I look around here and I see a lot of people who are really struggling.  I figured some of this stuff could be helpful to someone, so here goes.

* Many of the things you need to do in order to deal with depression involve things that depression makes especially difficult.  That's why it's such a bitch of a condition.  Understand that if you intend to undertake a path to health, you will need to do a lot of things you really don't want to do, and exert energies you feel like you don't have.  It will suck...temporarily.  Face up to the suck.  Know the suck is coming.

* Get into counseling now.  Don't wait.  You're missing out on some things if you don't start facing up to your depression with seriousness.  You may not realize how badly it has affected you - accurate self-assessment is hindered by depression.

* Not every counseling experience is equal.  Cognitive therapy is very popular at the moment, which is a kind of therapy that tries to point out to you that some of the things you're thinking don't line up with reality.  And that's good, it's important to see that.  People respond to reasonable discussions.  Depression, however, doesn't always do that.  So if you don't think you're being helped, KEEP LOOKING until you meet a counselor who says things that resonate with you.

* The fact that you experience serious depression makes you different from most people.  That experience is valuable.  When your self-esteem is at its lowest ebb, keep this in mind.  Just because you choose to do something about your depression, it does not mean you have to be Susie Sunshine (thank Christ).  You are still you, and you don't have to be like everyone else, as long as you're not suffering.

* Don't reject medication just because it's medication.  Talk to people who have used antidepressants, and get a feel from them what it's like to use them.  They really do help and can be lifesaving during your worst times.  I had an argument with my shrink about taking them.  I said, ""I don't want my joys to be dulled by a chemical.""  She said, ""When was the last time you experienced enough joy to make this a valid concern?""  ""Touché,"" I said.  I refer to my meds as ""shock absorbers"" because that's really what they are.  They just set a soft limit of how much negativity I can exert in response to any given situation.

* Depression is a condition of the body that can influence the condition of the mind.  Your health habits can influence your mental state enormously, and they can be incredibly important to whether or not you have a good day or a bad one.  Keep close tabs on your feelings.  It sounds incredibly dismissive to hear that ""life is not worth living"" can sometimes directly result from the 3 Diet Cokes you had at lunch or the 2 hours of sleep you got last night, but this is just the way things are.  The sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can move on and start living.

* There is a difference between *depression* and *despair.*  Depression can be effectively managed; despair is deadly.  Watch one so that it does not become the other.

* Get out and take a walk.  Step away from the Internet.  The Internet isn't a solution to your problems, it's another problem.  Except for this post on Reddit by me.  Trust it implicitly, it is pure goodness.  :)  Fresh air and exercise can't hurt you if you are depressed.  They can only help.

* Some of us have had very bad times indeed, where the despair has taken control and driven us to the breaking point.  And then it recedes and we can pretend to be normal again.  But when you experience some of the most intense blackness, you can't just bounce back and expect everything to be all right.  You need time.  Suicidal thoughts are traumatic and like any other trauma, they need to be healed.

* Above all, monitor your condition.  Recognize that every one of those times when you were in such despair that only cutting or drinking seemed to help, it started off with a mood change that was barely noticeable.  If you can just catch these things before they spin out of control, you can save yourself a lot of grief, effort, and recovery time.

Hopefully this helps someone.  I wish success to all of you.",24,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dnknr/i_am_experienced_with_depression_i_know_advice/,1286373653

do9ek,depression,lawless420,Problems with treatment,"Last year I was seeking treatment for some co morbidity problems of anxiety, depression, and especially ADD. I was going through a rough spot at the time when I started seeing doctors and I think my depression was what really struck a cord. I know that add can be stemmed from depression but I never really felt like this was the case. I was diagnosed as a child with add but my parents never wanted to treat the problem. They just figured it was stupid I guess. I was a pretty happy child also. But as I grew up and my ADD was never treated I started losing focus on accomplishing anything. I of course turned to some drugs and alchohol which is all in the past now. I did some heavy drugs too and quit on my own. No rehab or NA bullshit for me. But I have been becoming more depressed. My psyciatrist started to prescribe me things like zolor reimerin or what ever which I guess helped a little bit for my depression but It still wasn't right. I felt like my ADD was not being treated at all which is what I see to be the main problem. I was told I was bi-polar also which I thought was kinda ridiculous because I have dated girls with Bi-polar disorder and my sisters has it too. It just doesn't seem to fit.

 I then really hit a rough patch in my treatment when my ex put false accusation of assault on me because she was having a manic phase. I was sent to jail and they told me that they couldn't give me my zoloft or generic form because it was a narcotic. I did ask the nurse where the hell she got her certificate from. but I was locked up with out any medication in an open cell areas with violent people and no one to help me get out. Very traumatic time. I came out and started back on my meds but I started to have abnormal thoughts and started taking some anti-psychotics for a time but eventually stopped when my insurance didn't cover it. Which was ok because I had gotten over most of what happened to me.

 I eventually stopped seeing my psychiatrist because I felt like we weren't going anywhere with my treatment. I also stopped taking my depression medication which did affect me to some degree for a week or 2 but nothing significant. I still feel depressed now but It's nothing I can't really handle naturally. I do want to start doing things with my life especially find work again and get into school but I know this is nearly impossible with my lack of motivation and inability to concentrate. I made an appointment tomorrow with my old psychiatrist but I am requesting to switch doctors to one more involved with adult ADD. I've tried to switch before and he said no. So I really don't know how to handle this. I want to treat my depression but more importantly I want to treat the thing that has caused my depression. How can I get this through to my doctor? He just sees me for 15-20 minutes at most and I never feel like anything is really accomplished. Has anyone else experienced this problem? Any advice on where to read up about this type of situation to maybe let the doctor know that I have been studying what is going on with myself and that I should be allowed to have a say in what direction we go with my treatment. I'm very tired of not having any direction. I want to be someone who feels confident about there life. I happen to think I'm a great guy. Very smart. charming, witting, and I guess handsome.

doh7v,depression,hmmzors,Haven't been doing well emotionally for almost a year now.,"Obviously this is a throw away. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. I was dating a girl, and I just want to say I never believed in love at first sight. Things moved pretty quick as we were instantly comfortable together. I have a background of a really crappy up bringing, verbally and physically (Not sexual) abusive father. Thing were really good in the beginning and then she informed me of somethings from the past that I promised I wouldn't ever talk about which I won't in detail it's just a LOT for 1 person to go through these 3-4 LARGELY stressful events especially at the age she was. I was very good to her but I wasn't perfect I screwed up a couple times but nothing too bad. Fast forward to a year later I moved in with her family for a month or so due to issues with my dad, shortly after moving back home we were fine or so I thought. She lied to me and cheated on me, then broke up with me for the guy. What started this whole spiral was that I felt she was the only person that truly loved me and I never opened up to anyone. She pushed the issues off that it was all my fault which went back to issues with never being good enough for my father. I dealt with it pretty bad, I went to therapy for about 1 1/2 months after the break up but still talked to her a bit. I've never been depressed to the best of my knowledge so I've never had to deal with the up and down of ""I'm better with out her, she ^*$#ed up it's her fault not mine, her loss"" to ""I can't do anything without her, I love her so much, she's the one, I really screwed up"". I had some suicidal thoughts but mostly just did stupid stuff such as drinking, I had a 2 week period where I was really into Vicodin, I think I took 4-5 in one sitting and got very sick but slept it off, looking back I should have gone to the hospital. Then about 3 months ago she started talking to me, started citing memories specifically why she missed me, so I stupidly fell back into the OMG we're getting back together. She hung out with me once and we talked, I said I wouldn't be ""That guy"" on the side and asserted myself. She broke up with her bf (Who she left me for) and called me on her way home from his house and all seemed fine. The next day I was so happy I went to one place to pick up her favorite juice and then another place for one of her lunches of choice and drove it to her at work. She didn't talk to me at all that day except to say ""I just need some space"". I felt this was unreasonable as I was the one who was hurt so I gave her one day and then an ultimatum ""You either want to be with me or you don't"". I'm writing this on 10/8 and her birthday is tomorrow so I was doing fine for maybe a month and it's coming back. I can't really take it anymore, I keep going back and forth whether I should text her tomorrow on her birthday and I keep having unrealistic dreams that she'll instantly fall in love with me again. I'm not even sure she was actually ever IN love with me. I think it might have been infatuation that faded and then it became unrequited love. I also just remembered that she used to say at night when she became depressed ""Don't leave me, I need you"" or something along those lines.

Summing things up: I thought I found ""the one"" and didn't believe in that sort of thing before, dated for a year, was cheated on, I went into a downward spiral with some suicidal thoughts, she came back to me, chose the other guy again, and now it's 1 day from her birthday and I've been really depressed.

doilg,depression,throwalongway,I don't want to do anything.,"First: I am not en english speaker, there will probably be some grammar errors and such.


I will just write this as it comes to me... 


I don't want to do anything. 


I used to be driven by what most people desire. But for the last couple of years I have gradually discovered that I have no longer any desires for material stuff, status, money, fame etc. It is as if these things that you are supposed to desire and strive for doesn't feel ""real"" to me, they are just illusions and without importance.


I have almost no libido. I do not feel attraction to others. Most women that I talk to feel incredibly shallow and almost like empty shells (I feel that the vast majority of people I meet are like this, regardless of gender/age/class etc). I feel that I have to ""create"" the desire within myself to have sex, and on the odd occation that I do, then it feels like it is just to relieve stress, not much enjoyment.


I am rather good within the field that I'm educated, I have a degree and I have developed much skills within the field, but all of this feels like it was done to get me more material wealth, status, money, attractiveness to the other sex etc. and now I see that it was all vanity. I don't want to strive for anything. Why should I work almost all of my waking hours when I know that I'm not doing it for myself or to gain anything that I want, nore does something good come from it. I would only do it because others (society) tell me to and that seems kind of wrong. At the moment I get by with doing as little as possible, unemployment insurance funds or studying courses that gives me control of my time and how i plan my day.


I would ofcourse do what is required in a life or death situation, or at least I think that I would, or that some life-preserving instinct kicks in. But I generally feel that if I were to die, well, that is just another event for my consciousness to witness, it is inevitable in the long run anyway.


I do feel very, very sad when dealing with ""society"", it feels like the whole thing is rotten and without a soul, there is no way to exist within it that does not greatly or entirely go against what I feel is right.


I do not however feel sad when experiencing life itself. I laugh often at jokes, funny stuff on reddit, comedy movies, weird stuff my cat does etc. 


I often have this (sometimes overwhelming) strong experience of joy when I take a walk in the forest, or look at the night sky, happen to see animals in the wild etc. I also feel a strong love for family and friends and nature itself.


I don't know if feeling/thinking like this is wrong, if it is depression... but i do feel that I am going against 99% of my surroundings, people and society. It feels like maybe it is not worth it, but I have no soloution.


Some people might say I'm just lazy, but i gotta say that I'm not, it goes deeper than that.

dokj8,depression,StilettoApprentice,Stop feeing like crap and take control back of your life!!,"This is something close to my heart and the reason for this is because i was someone who woke up one day and just couldn't recognise the person i was becoming. I hated everything that my life was turning into. 

I used to wake up 5 minutes before i had to leave to go to work, slap some makeup on the train and run my fingers through my hair to comb it.I felt as though i was like some dead zombie just walking around. I never went out,I stopped caring about how i was dressing, how i looked and how rude i was to people.  

So how did i get here ? Well i think it was due to a series of disappointments and let downs. Life is just bullshit really! it really is!!

So what i did one day was, i woke up and i just said ""That's it I've had enough! I'm taking back the control"". 

So i quit the job i hated and just took one big risk / Leap! 
i saw it as me jumping ship onto the floaty. 

I started a little challenge, whereby i would try and do things differently, everyday for 2 weeks. Things that i would never do, buy or wear. 

The first thing was - ""I would start taking more care of myself."" 

So  
I started getting up every morning and blow-drying my hair like i was going to the emmys!

Then i started doing all these skin care treatments to my face and body

I saw a naturapath and i quit smoking

I got acupuncture (for the first time)

I went to a mud bath (for the first time)

I started wearing makeup everyday (which i never did)

and

this one changed everything .......

I started wearing high heels IN THE DAY TIME. 

and as stupid as this may sound, it really worked. It changed everything in my life, it had such a profound affect on everything. I changed the way i was dressing and this changed the way people were reacted to me. 

As soon as i woke up in the morning i would have this little routine where i would ""Glam"" myself up. And it made me feel amazing! 

People saw me as having this amazing confidence ""Which i didn't"" but it sure was growing and people would constantly come up to pay me compliments. COMPLETE STRANGERS! Really random things like: ""I love that nail polish"" ""Did i see you at the Balenciaga show?"" ""What do you do?"" People started looking at me, seeing me differently. And the best thing about it all, was i was having fun!!! I was loving this new outlook, this change of perspective!!! I was loving that i was reconnecting with my femininity. I felt like i was living.  

And so i wanted to share this! Because it helped me. Try it people !!! If you're sick of feeling like crap - take control back! do the Stiletto Apprenticeship Challenge! See how it changes your life! 
i hope it can help you like it did me! 

My collegue did this with her best friend who was going through a divorce. They did it together and had a blast with it. For two weeks they would set little challenges like, they would wear nothing but big diamante earrings for 2 weeks or have a week where they would wear red lipstick.

Today is my 5th dose of Lexapro, and the last few days I've felt terrible, dead tired.  The last two nights I've been kept up all night with endless amounts of thoughts, and this morning I was starting to understand why people start thinking suicidal thoughts on these things.  I wasn't thinking about killing myself, and I don't think I ever would, but I just felt totally hopeless.  I've talked to my parents since and I do feel better now, I think the lack of sleep and the solitude was a big factor, but my question is is this the normal signs of starting on these bastards?  Or a sign to switch meds?  My friend and psychologist both said that the first couple weeks could be bad, so I don't know if I should ride the storm out or stop and wait for a new pill.",10,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dp22o/anti_depression_pill_help/,1286649617

dpgsd,depression,SpaceHippo_5,"I needed to rant about my feelings, thanks for providing the opportunity to do so, I've never told anyone how I've felt.","   A little background: my transition to college was rough. In my first year I failed a couple of classes and I felt completely overwhelmed. I formed a habit of falling into a funk of existential rumination whenever school work got hard. This has gotten to the point where every day for the past ten months I'll randomly tell myself during the day that someday I'm going to die. It's become absurdly funny to me and the thought has come up while in the middle of conversations, during parties, while I'm working out and once during a job interview. Uh oh, this is getting long, but oh well writing helps me think.

   The problem is that when I realize that I have a lot of work to do I lose all motivation and I start to think: ""what's the point?"" I realize my life will probably be a lot better with a college degree because I'll have more and better opportunities to do things, but at the same time I can't bring myself to do any work even though I've occasionally come to the conclusion that doing something during my lifetime might be better than just lying in bed all day. At one point I even resolved to keep getting out of bed every morning on the decision that even if I'm not happy or care about my life I can still put myself to use and help people who do care.

   Here's an interesting thing I've noticed though, some substances make me feel like everything will be fine, that worrying is pointless, and make me actually enjoy doing school work. Learning or doing anything productive then comes easily. Substances have included caffeine, amphetamines and some types of marijuana. You know it might be the stimulation because without the aid of stimulants the only time I can really get any work done or study is the day before a due date or test. I think the immense stress stimulates my brain to do things, but sometimes it's not enough and I just end up feeling overwhelmed. Procrastination is a problem I've had to deal with since kindergarten. 

 On top of me being able to get work done, substances take away the anxieties I feel whenever I have to interact with people, especially women and adults. I feel relaxed, confident, content and hopeful. I want to say I feel 'normal' but I'm under artificial influences so how normal could it be? What's better? Being truly normal or feeling good? Then again maybe my unaltered experiences aren't normal and substances bring me to normal. What is normal? Yeah, I confuse myself often and this leads to more anxieties, unsureness and making me feel like giving up.

**Edit** Wow I sounded really positive when I wrote this in the afternoon. Now I've staid up all night and have gotten no homework done at all and I have class in three hours. I try doing it but I just get this huge anxiety that makes me go relieve it somewhere else. I spent a good time staring at myself in the mirror telling my reflection to ""man up"" because the fact that I can't do a little bit of school work is completely ridiculous. Then I got distracted writing poems, being on reddit and for some reason I started imagining what it would be like to be a soldier in WWII waking up on D-Day and so went and read about Omaha Beach on Wikipedia. I feel really disappointed in myself, which just makes me want to do my work even less. I feel like I'm justify to myself that I have ADHD so that I have an excuse for being so lazy/unproductive.

dpixd,depression,un4giveable,Thoughts,"Has anyone looked back on their life and had the realization that most memories they have are somehow, in some way, related to being depressed?

I had this realization tonight.

Don't get me wrong, I have great memories from a great childhood with a family I wouldn't trade the world for.  Yet  somehow I find myself always being depressed.  I've gone to treatment, two separate doctors actually but neither were really able to tell me anything I didn't already know about  myself.  I don't necessarily blame them rather more the system that counseling portrays.  Feel depressed,  go to doctor who then ask baseline questions to get a feel for you and make an assumption that they then seem reinforce throughout the numerous (1-2 times a week) sessions they make you come back for. &lt;/end rant&gt;.    

The problem I have with this realization is not even so much the past depression, but more the previous and future depression.  I need to get a handle on this before I feel I can fully move forward in life.  I'm not looking for  responses telling me to quit whining because I'm not whining I just needed to vent.  And maybe, for once have someone really listen. 

**Update** Thanks for the posts everyone.  It really does help to get things out sometimes and I appreciate the time everyone took to respond.  To respond to points that were brought up.  I have tried medication, for a while actually.  Almost two years.  It helped and definitely gave me more of a sense of control of things.  I noticed when I was on them that I wouldn't be as sincere (for lack of a better word) to things going on around me.  I felt like I was immune to feelings.  Because of that though I know that they worked, maybe to well?  To clarify I was on a few different types, at different dosages.  I know I need to go back and I really only have my stubbornness to blame for not, yet.  

I agree that when you're depressed everything seems to have a depressed tone to it (I always think of the Matrix and how every time the matrix is shown there's a green hue to the film, it's a stretch but it makes sense to me).  Unfortunately I know there's no quick fix to depression, but support helps.  Thanks!

dq21d,depression,[deleted],Last year of college. Growing tired of campus life and stressed about the future.,"I guess I'm just looking for someone to talk to about this stuff. I'm a senior in college and so far this year, I've just kind of felt like I'm drifting along. That my only goal is to make it through the day, without much hope for anything else. Usually I wake up, go to class, watch some TV, cook dinner, start homework, go to bed, repeat. My major is pretty demanding so I don't have a ton of free time. And when I do, I just feel like relaxing after working hard all day. So I never really do anything that's fun. Just kind of coasting along from class to class, homework assignment to homework assignment.

I'm also getting sick of the college life. I'm tired of living in a gross house with 6 roommates. Tired of walking everywhere (especially in the winter). Tired of being a student and going to the library. Tired of fast food / microwaved food. Tired of the same old house parties and bars every weekend. I could go on, but you get the point. It's just getting old. *But*, I won't let myself get excited about the future (after graduation), because I have no idea what lays ahead of me. I have no idea what I'm going to do for a job (or even what I want to do). No idea where I'm going to live. Or if I'll be close to my friends. It's just like a giant mystery that lays before me.

So I don't know. Like I said, I just feel like I'm coasting along without any real direction or reason. I'm not ""down"" or depressed. But I don't really feel excited about much either. Lately I've just kind of been at a constant ""content"" feeling, and it just doesn't feel right.",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dq21d/last_year_of_college_growing_tired_of_campus_life/,1286861629
dq21m,depression,unmotivated_confused,Really confused and in need of a rant,"Hi /r/depression.  3rd year college student here.  This might be kinda long, but I'm guessing if you've been around here you're probably used to that.  For the past month or more (essentially when the semester began I guess) I've been having trouble doing...just about anything.  I often find myself sitting and staring blankly for hours.  So far this semester I've pulled several all-nighters because I was only able to begin work around 2AM on the morning it was due.  Needless to say my sleep-schedule has taken a hit.

How I feel can vary.  Sometimes I feel very sad and cry a lot, sometimes with reason, sometimes without.  Sometimes I just feel blank (which is where I am right now).  At the worst of times, I have suicidal thoughts, though I am far too attached to my family to do something like that to them.

My problem is this: all of this stuff will happen and then, after a few days, I will begin to feel normal again.  Sometimes all the more confident and ambitious.  When that happens, I begin to dismiss what came before.  Because I feel normal again I doubt that I ever really had a problem and was just being lazy or something.  I organize everything, see my friends, start doing everything that had to be done, and then I again find myself in the next couple of days sitting and staring blankly for hours, and everything feels so distant and irrelevant and I just want to sleep and not wake up.

I don't understand why I'm moving through this pattern so frequently.  I want to reach out and talk to someone but before I know it I don't feel the need, and then before I know it again I'm worse off than I ever had been in the past.

And for my first two years I've always been in a not-so-great place emotionally, but I never felt so unmotivated and apathetic.  In fact, it made me even more willing to bury myself in work, and I've been on very good academic standing because of that.  Honestly the perfectionism with which I approached my work probably wasn't that healthy.  Now I can't bring myself to touch it most of the time.

I'm mainly writing this because I want to document how I feel right now before I doubt myself again.

Right now I have my study abroad application in front of me and I have to write some essays for it.  I have a very, very good chance of being accepted and it's very important to me on multiple dimensions.  But I'm already behind the ball and I cannot bring myself to write the first word.

I know I'll feel better later.  But that's the part that really bothers me, because 'later' I won't want to admit what is happening 'now'.  And I think I'm also afraid to ask for help and be told that there's really nothing wrong with me, I'm just being lazy.

In 2008, after being on Zoloft for almost 2 years with no additional therapy, I quit cold turkey.

And then, nothing.

I had never really thought about it until the past two weeks, but I've realized that I'm now, more or less, totally emotionally void. I also have mild symptoms of sexual dysfunction: genital anesthesia and if I can orgasm almost no pleasure whatsoever.

dr2mn,depression,[deleted],Feeling Melancholy,"Hi /r/depression. I've spent the evening browsing through and thought I'd say hi. I can't quite bring myself to use the word depressed, since I know many of you are struggling with much more than me, so I guess I'll say I'm feeling melancholy.  

I'm lonely. I see people on campus living their lives, making friends and forming relationships and I'm just the quiet observer. Sure, I'll say hi and we'll probably chat about a project or a school event or what you did last weekend, but it never progresses beyond casual acquaintance.

I'm 21 years old and I've never had a girlfriend. My inner circle of friends have all paired off, and quite a few are recently married. I feel like there's something wrong with me, or I'm different somehow. As time passes, I'm worried that I'll become (or have already become) the odd person who's never been in a relationship. I'm worried that I'm out of step with my peers and the gap will only continue to widen. I'm supposed to graduate next year. What then? If I haven't coped in a university environment, what chance is there for me in the real world?

I'm starting to get behind in my classes, and can't quite find the motivation to finish all of my projects. I'm working a customer service job that pays well but doesn't feel fulfilling. Having to deal with demanding, often self-centered people is taking its toll and it's making it harder and harder to start work each day. I telecommute, so I sit in my apartment alone for 8 hours trying to make people happy.

Today I went for a walk and thought about happiness and fulfillment and how I could meet them. I have a romanticized, though very simple idea of where I'd love to be, but I honestly don't know how to get myself there. I feel like I'm drifting along on my current course, trying my best just to keep up with everything that I can't break free and nudge myself in a different direction. I want to reboot my life, but I don't know how and part of me is afraid that I'll succeed and won't be able to deal with it.  

Sorry about the wall of text, but typing this out has helped a little bit. :)

","Okay, so, I'm a 16 year old girl in high school, and I'm junior. I'm really anti-social, and sometimes I avoid hanging out with my friends because of that. I have extremely low self esteem/confidence...I dont like the way I look at all. I'm ugly, and I think I'm kinda fat (I'm 5'8'' and 120 pounds). I have no confidence in myself and i'm always putting myself down, and setting myself up for failure. I've had two other ""depressive"" episodes, and they each lasted about two months or so. The first time i just ignored it, and it went away. The second time it got worse, and my mom made me see this therapist, but i stopped going after about a month because it was too awkward for me. i hate it. i just cant express how im feeling to other people. i started to feel better anyway. and now, its back, and ten times worse. i feel like im trapped inside of myself. i absolutely dread getting up in the morning. i cry every morning before i go to school, because i hate it that much. i have to try so hard to keep from crying during school. i dont talk to my friends anymore, at all. im practically silent during school, and ive stopped answering their texts and phone calls. i can barely concentrate during school. i used to be super good in school, straight A's and all that, but now, its like, im falling asleep in school and im not understanding anything. i cant focus because my depressing thoughts are consuming me. im failing pre-calculus right now, and i hate myself for that. today in school, we took the PSATs for three hours, and i cried during it, because i did not know what the heck i was doing, and i knew i wasnt gonna do good, even if it is only practice. and after school most days, i just go to my room and cry until i get a headache and decide to either do homework or go to sleep. its usually sleep. i dont know why i feel like this, but i hate it. i've been self-harming for the past month now, but no one knows about it. i do it because i need to feel something other than nothing all of the time. i need the pain, to take away the numbness. and its because i hate myself, and i deserve it. i hate that im so shy, and i hate that im not smart, and that i hardly even play my violin anymore (i lost all motivation for that, after 6 years of hard work). i feel like i have absolutely no purpose in this world. none at all. im not important. my parents are too busy with my older sister and her baby and yelling and arguing to notice that im falling apart. ive also been having suicidal thoughts recently. ive never wanted death more than i do now. i just hate living, its so tiring. i just cant seem to fight the feeling that theres nothing here for me, nothing at all. i feel so distant from everything, like im constantly in a fog. i could be with my friends, while everyone is talking and laughing, and i'll just be sitting there as if im by myself, like im in a trance. i feel like im trapped in a separate world from everyone else, and i cant find a way out. i feel like im not even alive anymore. like im only existing, going through the motions, putting on a show for everyone. and i hate it. i hate it so much. i honestly dont know what to do anymore. i want to die, but i know i dont have the courage to commit suicide. i just dont. which is why im thinking about starving myself to death. i know it sounds stupid, but its the only way out. everyday i dont eat is a day closer to success. success meaning death. i need the hunger pains, the weakness, the dizziness, to counteract this numb feeling i have. I barely eat anything anyway because i've lost all of my appetite. i just wish i could escape, but its impossible to escape yourself, which sucks. i need help. i know i do, but im too afraid to ask for it.

drjq3,depression,ghostwater,I think I'm depressed. I don't know why. I don't know what to do.,"I can’t sleep anymore. I’m so tired in the day I can barely function. At night I can’t get a wink of sleep. I never get comfortable. If I finally fall asleep, I don’t get much rest. My dreams are horrible. I toss and turn. I wake up a lot. 

The paranoia. Every time I leave my room. When ever anyone is around. I feel like everyone is watching me. Judging me. I didn’t used to give a fuck about what anyone thought. Now I can’t even pay attention in class because I am a step away from having a panic attack. I almost started crying when I walked across the quad yesterday. It was too much pressure. I can feel the weight of every eye and every thought on me. I can feel the weight pushing my insides around, making my blood heat. But the weight doesn’t exist. This fact keeps me on onside of the cliff. I feel like I’m edging closer. I’m going to fall soon.

I don’t want to leave my room. I want to be alone forever. Just thinking about being around people freaks me out.

If I’m not anxious or paranoid, I’m angry. Every little thing gets to me. I get so angry about everything. 

I don’t want to kill myself. I don’t think I could ever bring myself to it. But at the same time I don’t want to continue. Whenever I drive I think of ways to get in a crash and make it look like an accident so people wouldn’t think badly of me if I died, or pity me or something. A lot of times I wish something would go horrible wrong and just crush me to pieces so I don’t have to continue like this. I can’t continue like this. I want to disappear. 

I have no reason to feel this way. I have so many good things in my life. I’m at a great college. I have a car. I have a lot of things. I’ve been so many places. People love me. People care about my well being. Not many, but more than enough to stop me from hurting them like that.  I have no reason to feel this way. People have real problems.

ds083,depression,throwythrowaway,My story (probably tl;dr) ,"I don't really know if this is the right place for this, if it isn't, I'm sorry and I'll delete this post if possible. I must warn that this will probably be way TL;DR. With that warning out of the way, let's begin. 

I guess I've always been depressed. I guess it all started when I was just a little kid. My mother would always fight with my father. She'd get drunk and hit him and yell at him late at night every night. I woke up every single time and watched it happen. I watched my mom hit my dad, pull out knives, pour beers on him, yell, all of that crazy shit. I was 5 years old and under then, my brother never woke up, he was two years younger than me and he never knew about how they fought. I was terrified of my mom, after they would fight I would make my dad lay in bed with me until I could fall asleep because I was so scared of her. On Christmas Eve when I was 5 years old my mom left and never came back home. She left my dad and went off with another guy. 

I can't remember exactly when they started fighting for custody of my brother and I, but I remember the things that happened during that time. Both of my parents wanted custody of both my brother and I. I was very adamant about living with my father, and my brother seemed to want to live with my mother. I don't know why, I've never understood, the only thing I could ever figure is that he just didn't know how bad she was, like I said he never woke up and saw them at night, that or he was just too young and he really didn't remember them together, I really don't know. I remember being at my Mothers apartment, it was just her and I there, she kept asking me if my father did drugs, I kept telling her no, every time I told her no, she sent me up to my brothers room and made me sit there until the next time she called me out and asked me the same question, this repeated all day until 7:00 came and it was time for my dad to pick me up. She recorded all of my telephone calls, I know I was young and had very few rights to privacy, but what she did with the phone calls is what I have a problem with. I was in about 7th grade and my boyfriend and I had just kissed/made out for the very first time the previous night, when I went to my moms house, my boyfriend and I talked on the phone and very shyly discussed the previous night. My mom interpreted our conversation about kissing, into a conversation about having sex, she brought the tape to my fathers house the next day and played it, to my horror, in front of my father and I. I tried to explain, she wouldn't listen, she made me take a pregnancy test ONE DAY after it happened. At the time, I didn't know that a pregnancy test wouldn't show anything the next day, but now I do. She would do things like this all of the time just to fuck with me and be hateful. She's told me that she has Cancer to get me to forgive her for all of the stupid shit she's done to me knowing that it was a lie. Literally fifteen minutes after I found out my Grandfather died, my mother told me how selfish it is to be sad when people die. 

My point here is, my Mom has always been evil to me. I'm a female and I've had an extraordinarily hard time getting through life with no woman influence. As a teenager this was especially difficult.

Fast forward a bit here to my senior year of high school. About ten days after my senior year started, my grandfather passed away. My father and I moved into my grandfathers house when I was in the fifth grade because he fell and broke a hip and needed someone to take care of him. Ever since he broke his hip, it was just one thing after another, his health was very bad and it wasn't uncommon for him to be in the hospital for weeks at a time many times a year. He was diabetic, had to get a feeding tube, couldn't walk very well, required a nurse to come daily, etc. Before he died, he was in the hospital for several weeks. I didn't visit him often during that time for lots of reasons, I was really busy, band camp 9 hours a day for two weeks, senior year starting, I was a stupid fucking selfish kid. Shit that I look back and know how unimportant it was. I was a stupid kid and can't forgive myself for not being there with him, for not visiting more, for not spending more time with him. More than anything, I hate myself for this. Since he's died I haven't been able to make myself visit his grave, I don't think my father has either, I hate it, I can't think about him without crying.

Since high school, I've done nothing. I have lupus, I'm so depressed that I literally have not left my house more than ten times in five years, three hospital visits, one funeral, my brothers graduation, and maybe my grand parents house for one or two Holidays. I'am absolutely fucking paralyzed with fear that my father, and other people I love, but especially him, will die.  I know that everyone in this world will die and that it is a part of life but rationality has no effect on my fear. I still live with my father, I wake him up several times a night just to make sure he isn't dead. I can't explain how posessed with this fear that I am.

I'm so ashamed, I'm so ashamed of what I'am that I just don't know how to get any sort of help. I can't bring myself to tell my father about it. I have no health insurance so I'm not really sure what my options would even be if I could bring myself to try to get help. I'm so tired of living like this, I can't take it any more. How do I change myself? How do I get free of this? 


If you made it through this, thank you for your time.

**tl;dr:** I'm depressed, my mother is terrible to me, I'm rendered completely inert by fear of my father and loved ones dying, I have lupus, no health insurance, uneducated, miserable and all of the rationalization in the world doesn't make it go away. I just feel so hopeless. What the hell do I do?",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ds083/my_story_probably_tldr/,1287223993

ds6l0,depression,roninhenchman,Am I depressed? I'm not really sure.,"I’m not really sure if what I’m feeling is depression or maybe just being down. I’m not really sure how to express myself and I apologize if this comes off extremely disorganized and confusing. I started feeling unhappy a long time ago - approximately 2 years ago. The thing that confuses me the most about all of this is that some days I’m fine and some days I’m not. I can go from one hour where I'm on top of the world and then all the sudden I can feel as low as dirt. I find it hard to get motivated to do my work, and sometimes I just blow it off. I am constantly wishing that a car will run me over on my way to work, and the other day when a car almost slammed into me and missed, I felt really upset about it. I want to cry a lot, not really sure why a lot of the time, but I just hold it back and don’t. My real question is that am I actually depressed or am I just down because I’m not dealing with my problems?  Is that the same thing? I’m not sure. Depression runs in my family, but I don't see myself like those in my family who are diagnosed with it. I tried to talk to my girlfriend about how down I was about things like my job and being rejected to a bunch of grad schools. I said I couldn’t take anymore failure and said I was just being pessimistic. So I’m not really sure what to think. The worst part is how guilty I feel just talking about this. I actually wrote this out twice before and deleted it each time because I feel ashamed of feeling this way. My hands are even trembling while I type it now. It took me over a year to build up the nerve to talk to my girlfriend about it, and even then I had to awkwardly attempt it at least 3 times before I said anything. Any comments/ suggestions?

ds804,depression,swatkins44,so what do you make of this?,"ive always felt mildly depressed all my life. Just the constant sucking emptiness, off and on ability to enjoy anything, you know standard stuff. 

Lately though it has been much worse. Lately I've been feeling distant from my best friends (who are also my roommates). I have had days in the last week where everyone is hanging out in the main room i will go lay in my bed and just think... I also get strong urges to cry when i am feeling like this, but have trouble doing it. Music helps get it out. To simplify what i think my issue is to the extreme, i was an outcast in my childhood and all the way up through high school i never had a friend who didnt abandon or betray me. Because of this i fully expect it to happen again, the only question in my mind is when? But im also scared that it will be my depression that drives them away. That doesnt help snap me out of it of course...

Lastly, what scares me most, is that i have been wondering to my self if ceasing to exist would be all that bad (im atheist). I mean, its how we were before we were born so what difference does it make? I dont think i would ever do anything to end my life because i am not very good with commitment, and thats basically the ultimate commitment, but just the fact that i was thinking about how suicide might not be so bad.... i dont know.

ds95f,depression,[deleted],I don't know what to do with myself anymore,"I don't know what I expect to gain out of this post, but I need to rant and don't feel comfortable talking to anyone in person. I'm a college freshman living on campus and I'm suffering from (no official diagnosis but I'm almost positive) depression, low self esteem, and social anxiety. These have been lifelong problems for me, but I more or less had them under control during my senior year of high school and was pretty damn happy with life just 2 months ago when I moved out.

I feel like I did all the ""right"" things here but got none of the results I wanted. I've been pretty talkative, (at least by my introverted standards) friendly, and open to meeting new people since day 1. I joined lots of clubs and try to talk to people there. I leave my door open when I'm in my room and sometimes walk around the dorm hallway to randomly talk and hang out with people. As a lifelong introvert, these things were all really hard for me to do, but I came into college with a positive attitude of changing myself and meeting new people, so I sucked it up and figured everything would work yet. And yet, nothing did. I feel like everyone here found a social group and steady friends except for me. People seem to like me, but nobody ever goes out of their way to talk to me or to invite me to hang out, even though I spent a lot of time in the beginning of the year doing so to them.

Now I'm halfway through the semester and these consistent social failures have really started to take their toll on me. My social anxiety that I thought I had under control is starting to sneak back in, and I'm starting to become scared to even leave my room because I don't want to confront people. Because I often don't have anyone to eat meals with, I find myself just not eating at all because I don't want to be seen eating by myself. I feel lonelier by the day and am experiencing all the typical symptoms of depression. Now it's yet another Saturday night and I'm sitting here alone on reddit, with no plans while I watch people walk up and down the hallways as they prepare to go out and have fun with their lives. I've thought about seeing a counselor here at school, but I honestly don't see how that will help my problem at all.

dsc2e,depression,icantpassthebotest,depressed huge amounts of anxiety and lacking free will,"I am a 16 year old male junior  I have dyslexia so my spelling sucks. Please forgive me. 
I feel dead, falling, lonely, like I am watching a movie, fractured, and nonexistent, even in myself. My goal in life is to lay with a girl around my age who doesn't judge. Just lay there with her.                           
I really only have three emotions: nervousness or anxiety, depression, and the brief sanctification caused by the euphoria one experiences after taking their favorite drug or performing a certain behavior. The first, anxiety, usually lasts as long as I am in that situation but the feeling can be re-conjured through the remembering of the situation. The second emotion, depression, can last anywhere from hours to days. Finally, the third emotion lasts the time I spend consuming the drug or performing the behavior plus several minutes after.                         
So why am I saying this? Well for one I always feel apathetic towards life, towards people. This is because I am afraid to feel anything else.  I never feel sympathy and when I do I try to avoid it. I don't listen to any music unless I am extremely depressed. I try everything I can to disguise my individuality. I weir the same gray shirt with blue jeans every day to school. I try everything in my power not to be noticed or express any divergence from the crowd. Of course this makes me stand out in some instances. I am the kid who weirs the same cloths every single day and when asked why I truthfully reply, ""it’s easier this way"".
This is true because I fret over the most insignificant things relating to those that have to do with appetence. This isn't true for all though, I don't care about grades, I don't care about my opinions being struck down, in fact I love to argue but something about my individuality excluding my opinions causes extreme anxiety for me.                         
Depression, I assume, is a common feeling after one makes a big mistake but for me everything is a big mistake especially with regard to social situations. So every time I mess up a conversation, either because I am out of practice or get nervous during it and can't think, I feel like I have failed and enter a temporary depression that last the remainder of the day.                  
Because my life is so dominated by addiction I feel that I do not have self control. I feel like I am being pulled around by my ID and super ego (I know it’s not commonly accepted anymore to divide the human mind in this way but it’s easier to explain this way). But I have no control. I cannot go and say that I want to change this in my life so I am going to do this or something as simple as. Today I am going up to this person and saying hi, today I am going to finish my homework now! Simple things are completely out of my reach. Free will. I do not doubt it for I sent a ranting email to someone despite my super egos objections to it, and without any addiction motivation. That was the furthers I have ever come to breaking the changes.                
This lack of control leads to the fluctuating of me to the point that I am not me in 6 hours. TO make it more clear now I am person 1 in 6 hours I will be person 2 and maybe in another six I will be person 1 again.                  
	                   
I have a friend and my friendship with him is as important as anything. I went to school with him sense 5 grades till my current 11th grade. I understand his thoughts, I think; he wants to put me down to put himself up. I am ok with it for I know what he says is true but it sometimes gets annoying. Everything I say every opinion contrary to his met with illogical criticism of my intelligence social life and success. Something that I ponder everyday is confirmed to be as big of failure as I believe it to be. 
For example he constantly asks me what type of music I listen to. He knows the answer I don't like any music, or so I say for expressing any individuality would make me open to criticism. He then will say something along the lines of ""every lesions to music"" how can you not like music. HE goes through the history on my computer and laughs at things I have searched. If I read smart stuff he will laugh at it. I am only better at rock climbing in a Jim in comparison to him and he won’t admit that it is so. He will ask me what I have done over the weekend and I will reply with the truth that I have done nothing. He then laughs at me despite already knowing the answer. If he treats me so bad the only reason I hang out with him is because he has the exact same interests as me and I wouldn't have anyone else to do anything with when he isn't around.                                  

Tomorrow I might get a haircut my friend rightly pointed out that I will get the same haircut that will grow back bad because I am afraid of change. ""That is the same reason why you weir that shirt everyday""            
The truth is I am not afraid of change I am afraid of making a bad impression. I am afraid of being stuck with a mistake. I have realized my dream before of lying next to a girl. It happened in Costa Rica when I wasn't afraid of what I said because I would be out of there in two weeks and in a bus ride I was laying next to her. I would never do that in the states because I hate the glory and prize that seems to rest on women. It’s like men are hunters and women are to be shot, stuffed and shown to their friends in order to prove their manlyness. Same applies if a man were to stuff a less impressive animal then he would be thought lets of. So what I am really afraid of is being stuck with something that I cannot change, stuck with regret. That I need to change in order to get on with my life so that I am make mistakes without suffering them more then I should.

I seem to have lost focus, I can't just sit and watch a movie or something because I always end up turning it off and then wanting to do something else.

dsf4i,depression,[deleted],two months of depression,"I just started my first year of college this year, and I've never felt more depressed in my entire life. The first month of college went great, I didn't have a care in the world. Now it is a struggle to wake up every morning. It isn't like I don't have friends, I have some awesome friends. I have an awesome girlfriend who is leaving to return to her college on Monday night, and my sex drive is so low I've only seen her once. I got a gym membership to help distract me from my feelings, but I can't even motivate to go to the gym anymore. Doing a good job on my work is a near impossibility, and everything sucks. I consider suicide almost daily, but I don't think I would have the guts to do it. I can rationalize my situation and I know how much I have going for me, but that doesn't stop these terrible feelings that I have all the time. I've been seeing a school counselor once a week, and he's surprisingly good. All I want to do is lock myself in a dark room and sleep my life away. I've always thought suicide was the most selfish act someone can take, and I would never want to inflict that kind of hurt on anyone I care about, but I'm having some trouble finding some other options. :/

I also posted this in suicidewatch.

dsh36,depression,throwthisfeelingaway,"dear reddit, i hate this feeling sooo much...","Hi Reddit,

I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm completing my fourth year at a great school, a family who cares about me, amazing friends who have been there all along... and yet i feel _terribly_ lonely.

The only way to shake off this feeling is to be with several people whom I really care a lot about (family and a couple of close friends). The thing is, I live 2 oceans away from the family, and I can't be with those close friends all the time. When this feeling of loneliness comes, I don't want to do anything whatsoever. I usually love to eat, but I can't eat. I usually love to socialize, but I am so unsociable its crazy. 

The frequency of these feelings arising have increased lately, and it's making me consider throwing away a world of opportunities on this side of the globe to go back home. At least there, I have family who'll always be there (I'm 22f, have been away from home for 7 yrs now, and have been loving it most of the time until recently).

I'm scared - I feel like I'm going nuts and the thing is, even when I'm hanging out with the few friends who can cure this, I sometimes think (dread) the moment that our hang out session is over and I have to go back to being lonely.

Is this a sign of depression? Does anybody else ever feel this way? :S",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dsh36/dear_reddit_i_hate_this_feeling_sooo_much/,1287343693
dshma,depression,depressedgirlfriend,How did depression affect your relationship? What's the best way to proceed if it's my gf that's depressed?,"This is a cross-post from r/relationship_advice. The advice I got there consisted of telling her to seek help, break-up with her if you aren't getting your needs met, etc. She is already aware that there's a problem, so aside from that, how do I handle us right now? I'm seeking advice for the hopeful short-term bout she's going through. I haven't known my girlfriend for too long so I don't know the severity of this problem. She is aware of her problem so please don't mention that I must tell her to seek help. It's difficult getting through to her because not only is she depressed, she's also very anti-social. I wanted to ride out the storm but not sure how to proceed. This may be a bit unorganized so hang with me, please.

When you first met your depressed SO, did they put their best foot forward so you were only blindsided later from them with enigmatic behavior? Did you misconstrue this as disinterst?

I have a girlfriend (we're both in our mid-twenties) who I've known only about six months, and the her I know now is lacks a little more energy and effort in our relationship. It's apparent she is going through something. She's still affectionate in her own way, but I tend to compare her to how she was just a few weeks ago. Even in the honeymoon phase of our relationship, I know she still had low energy, but it's as if she tried harder. I think she's going through something, and she's hinted at depression before. She sleeps a lot, she rarely wants to leave the house, she doesn't like social gatherings, and she admitted that even on our first date she had to force herself out of her shell to go.

So REDDIT, can any of you who have either been depressed while dating or are someone dating a person who suffers through bouts of depression give me some amazing advice?
If I shower my girlfriend with affection can that get tiresome to her? I almost feel like she has micro-mood swings on top of that. I just don't know how to deal with my girlfriend right now and I can't help but feel like I'm somehow culpable that she is feeling so down and I tend to feel like I'm doing something wrong if I can't bring her out of it. I realize that's not the right mindset, I'm no superman, so that's why I'm here. I want to find a good balance of letting her know I care about her without overwhelming her. I don't want to take it personally when she's not wanting to hang out with me or doesn't want me sexually after being apart for days on end.

So please; any advice on how I, being a generally happy person, should deal with a depressed girlfriend with low energy, low libido? I'm beginning to take her low libido and lack of effort in relationship personally and I don't want to. I've heard somewhere that depressed people have a tendency to push those away that they care about so they don't suffer along with them. Is there any truth to that, and do you have any general advice on how to proceed with her? Are there things depressed people absolutely hate to hear? Do they hate when their SO's are too mushy? 

**tl;dr:** Any good tips on how to survive in a relationship with a woman who is depressed? It's beginning to drain me and I'm left with doubt about her feelings for me.

I feel like something is wrong with me.  I was taking celexa earlier this semester for about 3 weeks but stopped a week or so ago because I thought it might be causing the sleepiness, but it hasn't gotten any better.  

Is this normal?  Is this caused by my depression or is it just making it worse?  My eating schedule is also terrible, I've had difficulty eating and maintaining my weight ever since I started taking vyvanse for ADD 3 years ago.  Could this be affecting things?  I also don't ever exercise, I know that might help.

I've talked about this with my doctor but she has no idea what is causing what and neither do I, she's pretty much told me that I need to get on a normal sleep schedule before we can figure out what medications work or not, but I just can't.  I'm at a loss.  Has anyone had this problem?

I've been working in the tech/entertainment industry for about 13 years now, but I don't actually MAKE anything with my own hands.  I just manage things.  I feel like a fraud and scared I'm going to lose everything, every day.  I dread going to work on Sunday nights and it comes to moments where I feel like I don't want to live like this anymore.

I haven't been in a significant, loving relationship in my adult life and, at 37, I don't think I'm capable of it.  I have real problems with intimacy and being open to people.  I've spoken with shrinks about it for years, I'm on meds, and I still go through these rollercoaster cycles of anxiety and depression.  

I'm afraid of the world.  I had a really rough childhood and worked very hard to achieve a degree and hopefully make something of myself, but feel like I'm going to fail again.  In the past 3 years, I was laid off, lost my condo, lost every bit of financial security I had, and have had to declare bankruptcy.  

I can't sleep at nights, and I can't get up in the morning.  I'm extremely lonely and I can't even be bothered to try to meet someone.  I feel like my life has wasted away and I have no value.

The one thing in life I want the most is to be fucking normal for one fucking day cause I do not know what it's like whatsoever. My life isn't fucked up. I've never had a struggle with shelter/food/anything really, I was raised by great parents with great morals.

* She says that she feels too tired to do anything anymore and just wants to crawl into a ball and sleep. She said that she ""doesn't have the energy to want to do anything anymore.""
* She has been feeling worthless in a lot of areas, especially friends. She says that she feels that everyone is ""foreign"" to her and that she doesn't have any close ones anymore (although she certainly does).
* She's very easily aggravated by even small things.
* She feels distant, like she 's ""going through the motions"" and ""floating through everything.""
* She's had bad cramps and digestive problems that haven't gone away, even when she's seen doctors.

dt3ba,depression,[deleted],Isolation is killing me.,"I'm used to being alone a lot but I've reached a level of isolation and depression that's begun shutting me down physically. To be honest I'm very scared. Almost every day for the last two weeks I've ended up suddenly crying and then completely shut down. I'll literally stare at the wall for a few hours. In that time I'm just broken. I'm not really thinking about anything anymore.



I've become embarrassed going outside now because I know I can't remove the stress from my face. I feel like anyone who looks at me can see how much I hurt. It's embarrassing.



All the power, concentration and focus I have now goes to trying to balance out the effects of isolation. 

I've never given up and I'm not suicidal. Someone once told me that humans have an amazing ability to recover. I guess I always stubbornly believe that. But it can take a lot of time to get out of being isolated even when I'm trying hard. I never expected to start breaking down every day. If the isolation continues I don't know what would come next. 



I'm already shutting down mentally but I'm really worried that sometime it's going to be my heart. I'm in no shape right now to deal with an afterlife if there is one. It feels like I'm drifting out to sea, watching the land shrink in front of me. Sometimes I'll push against the current, fighting hard to come back. But I've spent so much time drifting already that my efforts fail no matter how optimistic I feel. 


I don't have any family, friends or a job. To be blunt I haven't had sex in over five years and that's pretty much the basis of all of this. I look for work frantically, I try to make friends and I even asked out my neighbor today (do I really need to tell you how it went?). My point is that I try. But just ""getting out there"" with no results isn't enough to keep me going. I don't feel any better about myself for trying anymore. At the end of the day, am I sleeping alone? Yes. That seems to be my only bottom line now. 



I've always been against it for myself but if I did have insurance or even the cash then I would just go get put on pills. I guess I just tell him that no one will touch me so I need to take pills now.
 I've already put two ads on Craig's List and responded to dozens. I also just finished a month on a sex/dating site and couldn't even get a number. That will make you feel low.

I hope I really don't die in such a failed pathetic state.

I have been researching bipolar disorder and depression, and I believe she suffers from the former. There are times when she has no energy, sleeps all day and will hardly get out of bed, times when she seems to have a ton of energy and will stay at a task from first in the morning until 4am, and times with frequent bouts of inappropriate anger and rage, where she will become very verbally abusive of me and scares our poor dogs to death yelling and raging at them for anything at all. I don't even know what normal is anymore and I am frightened.

In the past, I have very gently brought up the idea of seeing a doctor about her mood swings. When she is in a more lucid mood, she can acknowledge that it is a problem, but outright refuses to seek medical advice. At other times, she reacts to the suggestion with hostility. I have been doing a lot of research myself and she fits the description of bipolar to a T, and I know that there is effective treatment available, but I don't know how to get her to accept treatment. 

Please help me. I love her dearly but this is very difficult. I fear for our marriage and I don't know what to do. How can I help her?

EDIT: I am going to try and convince her to go see a therapist and go on their professional advice. Does anyone know of any good therapists in the Portland, OR area?",10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dtokl/i_think_my_wife_is_suffering_from_bipolar/,1287549568

dtqpd,depression,bobcat_08,"Going through existential depression, but it's getting better.","Growing up my raison d'etre came from adopting my parents' narcissistic self-assurance that they were right and that's that.  (They won't admit that they're that way, they consider themselves highly cultivated intellectuals, but there you go.)  A few intense, isolated experiences in college that I don't want to explain proved to me that they weren't always right.  I was a fucking mess for the past 3-4 years.  Spent every day in tortured denial, couldn't sleep or shit because of anxiety, fear and tension in every part of my body and psyche.  Lashed out at my parents because I needed someone to blame and I had a vague feeling they were behind it.

My boyfriend was the light at the end of the tunnel.  He helps me put things in perspective that help me not hate and fear so much.  I still have a lot of anger toward my parents, because now I know they indirectly encouraged me to suppress those feelings of mine that did not agree with their worldview.  It's hard not to express my feelings of irritation at my parents when I detect their flippancy toward life, the things that they think they understands and the indifference towards those they do not.  I know I shouldn't throw stones in glass houses, but that's besides the point that I'm struggling to reclaim myself.  It's still near impossible for me to be myself.

In fact I'm the worst I have been in years. It's as if my mind has decided to focus on everything negative about myself and everything negative that is going on with the world and it just won't stop.

The only thing going through my mind are that I'm stupid, annoying, that I look too old for my age, that I am completely useless, a fraud. I can't help but think that eventually everyone will see the fraud that I am. I keep thinking that despite my grades once I enter the real world I will fail at every job I get because I am a fraud.

I see the current political climate and I wonder how many more of my freedoms will be taken away in due time.

I just want to fast-forward my life, take a good look at it in 3rd person, satisfy my curiosity about the future and die.

I have no clue what the fuck to do now. I just want to be happy, and yet this doesn't seem to be an option.

du7mh,depression,[deleted],I'm tired of myself.,"Hey /r/depression, I've been lurking on this subreddit for awhile now. At work, at home, at school; pretty much everywhere. I fucking hate myself.

I'm 22 years old and I still live at home. Going to college for the past 4 years and I don't even have a 2 year degree yet. I've failed and withdrawn from at least 14 classes.  I have missed the last 2 weeks of class and I am afraid to show my face in there again. I'm going to drop it too. I promised myself I wouldn't do it this time, but I guess that's how much of a failure I am. I don't think it's even possible for me to graduate. I'm a piece of shit.

I hate my friends. Most of them at least. They are successful and the people that aren't I just can't really stand. Around them I pretend to be happy, I'm the fatass oaf of the group. It keeps them off my back at least.

I have never held a girls hand. I pretend to laugh and joke with friends about girls with dirty jokes but in actuality, I am the loneliest person I know. It's painful to watch people hold hands and be together, even if it is a casual thing. I cry at most movies when the guy gets the girl at the end. Not because I like it, but because I know I will never feel that feeling.

Sometimes when I'm driving home from work, I think of how easy it is just to run into a pole. Instant death at 80 mph. But I'm too much of a bitch to do that either. I don't know what to do.

I don't think I should feel like this. I graduated from High school with high marks, got scholarships to top colleges. I squandered it all though. Now I can't even pass a community college 2 year degree. I'm pathetic. A 350 pound blob of self pitying shit. I have no excuse to be sad.

Long time user here, I'm not going to use my normal account. So i made this one.
I'm feeling so depressed, there is this thing that keeps coming back and making me depressed. I've have a few Lymph nodes in my neck for about 5 years now (I'm 18). I have really no other symptoms, they don't hurt, they don't grow, i can move them, they are all about 1 - 2cm big. I did have 2 bad ear infections about 5 years ago and I'm hoping it's because of that they are swollen. I've heard that infections you get as a child can cause lymph nodes to swell and stay swollen for your whole life. 
I've never really told me parents about it, I have really bad anxiety and telling them i have lumps on my neck is just too much. I don't like people being sad, especially over me. 
I want to do so much in life but I'm afraid I'm going to die soon.
I'm not looking for advice or anything, just wanted to tell someone. I'll be getting a medical exam soon though as it's mandatory, so i'll post back here in about 5 months and tell you guys if it's cancer or not.

dv4yp,depression,throwawayposting,I've been mildly depressed for years and I think it's getting worse. ,"I think I have some sort of depressive or bipolar disorder. I usually feel either normal or slightly depressed and withdrawn but I occasionally will feel deeply depressed or very happy and energetic for no reason. 

When I become deeply depressed it's like a sudden shut down of my body and senses. I feel ugly, unclean, stupid, and regretful. If I'm working, watching TV, reading, eating, etc. I'll stop and feel repulsion from whatever I'm doing. I just want to lay down and curl into a ball and think of how I'm going to kill myself.

The times when I feel suddenly happy aren't as common as feeling very depressed but they do happen occasionally. I'll slowly start to smile and eventually end up with a huge grin on my face. I'll feel energetic and want to do a hundred things at a rapid pace.

When I only feel mildly depressed, I'm able to function but I don't want to do anything or be with anyone. The thought of any physical contact seems especially uninviting at these times. Everything seems pointless and miserable. If I'm home I'll just get in bed and not move or think. I will often but always say to myself ""I'm going to kill myself."" I don't plan or even think of attempting it, but the thought comes up.

In the past few months the words ""I'm going to kill myself"" keep showing up even when I'm in what I would otherwise call a normal mood. Often it shows up amongst a string of more benign thoughts. ""I have to do the laundry today. First I think I'll make some lunch. Maybe some pasta would be good... I'm going to kill myself."" I don't know if this is a sign that things are getting worse or what, but it's happening more and more often and I don't know how to cope with any of this. It seems almost harmless to me, almost comical, that the thought of killing myself should keep showing up out of nowhere, even when I'm feeling fine; when I'm with friends or just enjoying a meal or in class. But at the same time I realize this is not a normal thing and certainly not a good thing.

dv7cm,depression,SpicyMilk,"I'm lonely, chronically worried, and often depressed","Hello Reddit. I'm currently a college student (2nd) year. I don't know whether I am depressed or not (as per formal definitions or compared to others on here), but I do know that I'm perpetually worried, chronically tired, and often feel sad.  I originally posted this at /r/needadvice, but was pushed to post it here as well.

None of this has affected my school work, a I am fringing on a 4.0 QPA with nearly 100% in most of my engineering / math classes. The issue is that my state of well being is so dependent on my grades that a slight stumble can set me into a depression state that lasts for days.
The issue is that other than grades and internships and such, I have absolutely nothing going on. I go to class, eat, and then incubate in my dorm room. I have almost no friends up here, and I hardly have any confidence to leave my room, even to eat. I haven't had anything close to a girlfriend for almost three years, and most of the very few friends I have up here I knew from high school. I consider myself adept at conversation, but I cannot approach people.

I am afraid that this feeling of loneliness will evolve into a permanent mental pattern. I have difficulty projecting myself into a future dominated by a successful career and nothing else (in fact, I worry that my intellectual successes are slowly eroding, which is one of the chief causes of the classroom anxiety described above). Needless to say, over the last month or so (more than ever), I have felt chronically fatigued and my motivation (other than the motivation to study) in most of my affairs has started to asymptotically level to 0. On weekends, I leave the room to eat, and that's it.

I hope it has helped... even if it meant going from sad to gloomy... or vice-versa depending on which you think is worse ;). 

Just remember when things look like shit, feel like shit... when you have no one to turn to and nothing to lose... realize that life is a miracle. We are living, breathing miracles that have capabilities not even a god could fathom. 

Those moments when you creep yourself out and get to thinking that any existence is stupidly crazily impossible and that even if the universe wasn't infinite there would still be something outside of it... how everything you're made up of, is made up of something else and that something else is made up of another something and even when you go down to the most basic level of it... that's made of something that's made up of something... that's a miracle, this is a miracle. 

You don't always have to fit in with others and worries are about a dime a dozen... find someone or something to fall in love and forget about everything else... whether it's a girl, the stars or nature...  because in the end.. love isn't something you see or the result of being in a relationship, but something inside that cannot be described that drives passion. Love makes the world go 'round. 

I've fallen in love with the milky way and the stars... I have never seen such a beauty in the night sky. It's my obsession and sharing it with others allows me to relate on a different level. I am now who I envied... I still have a long journey ahead of me. Life goes on beyond our passions, but it makes everything worthwhile.

I have no motivation, I wake up earlyish in the morning with the intention of getting up, doing some work and making the most of the day. Inevitably I end up sleeping in and missing my lectures, feeling guilty I head to the library where I only waste more time browsing the internet.

Analysis complete, depression counter measures kicking in.  I know the source of these feelings.  The evidence is undeniable, these are good friends they've done wonderful things over the years.  And they've always been dependable.  You know this is just paranoia, a twisted interpretation of reality.  Look at what you just wrote, you know the source of every one of those fears.  It can all be traced back, back to that event years ago.  

I've wasted so much time, years lost to escapism to get away from depression.  And now the rage and pain here it comes.  It hastens the fall, so many to blame including myself.  Lower and lower, more misery.  And it trips, the emotional circuit breaker.  Emotions flatline, completely numb.  This is when suicide is considered.  And you know you can't, because you can't do that to them.  No matter how bad it gets, you can't do that to them.  Unable to suicide, but miserable, you break through the numbness and hit bottom.

Then it kicks in, cathartic euphoria.  It must be my self-preservation instinct.  You climb straight up and it brings tears because of how fast you rise.  Right now at this moment you can do anything.  You can make life better.  You must make life better.

This is not healthy, the lows are getting lower, the highs are getting less.  The cycles are getting more frequent.  Am I bipolar?  I don't think so, the highs don't feel anything like what I've read about mania.

The war rages on in my mind.  A never ending struggle, wearing me down and down...

And yet I just can't seem to get over her. She leads me on, and I think about her a lot, I can't get her out of my head at times. I've tried just not talking to her for periods of time, and it hurts both of us, as we are still good friends that like talking to each other.  
I've tried telling her how I feel, and yet she just doesn't say much. She doesn't like to talk about emotions at all. And I just want some closure, want to know. 
How do I get over her? Get her out of my mind, make me stop feeling like shit because of her. I've wanted to just drive out to her sometimes (400 miles now with our moves) and show up at her door, confessing how much I want her. But I know if I get turned down, I'm going to feel even worse.

dvlv2,depression,is_something_wrong,"What can you share about your own experience, 
given mine?","So, I'm a 20 year old guy, and I have some things I'd like to talk about and get some feedback on. I should start by saying that I'm in one of the top 10 colleges in the country...I'm of average height and average build (but not fit, the pot belly is evident in a t-shirt after a meal). I don't know if I'm good looking, I've never had anyone tell me so except for an internet person or two, but when I look in the mirror sometimes, I do think I am quite handsome. At other times, I'm disgusted with the pictures that people have taken of me. Oh, and I have a loving and well educated family and some great opportunities ahead of me, if I don't continue to waste them.  

Anyways, the last month and a half has been *especially* depressing for me, mainly because the fact that I had never been in a relationship (with a girl) really ate into me a lot. I realize that it's because I've never been in a relationship that I tend to idealize very much. The grapes that I've never had are always sweeter.

So I made lame (i.e. /r/r4r, ChatRoulette, Omegle, etc. yeah, laugh) attempts at getting a relationship. The defining characteristic of all these attempts was that they were all purely online, I never tried to meet up with or talk to someone who was physically near me. This was because I could hide my flaws behind the wall of the internet.

All of it was also an emotionally rocky experience...I'd get attached to the people I met very fast, I'd doubt myself, hate myself when I was ""rejected"", began to contemplate suicide, etc. 

Anyways, after spending the last five days almost constantly on Omegle after coming back from school, with tag lines like ""I'm on a quest...a quest for true love"", I finally realized how futile and ultimately self-betraying all of this was.

So yesterday and today, I spent time becoming who I used to be...and who I used to be is not a better person, just an apathetic person. I re-installed a few of the games I loved playing and pretty much distracted myself to the point where I actually don't care about the ""true love quest"" so much anymore.

Yay?

The thing is that for the last 2 years, after I started college. I've rarely not hated myself. I don't hate myself because of others, I hate myself because I have no willpower.

My first semseter in college was no shining achievement, but no grand failure either. It was just one filled with homesickness (away for the first time) and laziness which eventually led to stress as the work would pile up. The second term should have been better, I should have learned from my mistakes, but I didn't. It too was no shining achievement. I hated myself for being weak and repeating the same mistakes.

By the end of my first summer, I was pumped with hope for what I could do in my second year. I started off the semester great, but after some good achievement in midterms, began to slack off again. I finished the term with my best performance yet, but it would be the apogee of my achievement.

Because ever since last year (in about mid-October) when I had started slacking off again, I have not been able to stop slacking off. I spent my summer away from home, doing research at college, but it was an extremely depressing summer. Mainly because I had very little human contact (I shut myself in my room, never said high to my res-mates, ignored people who knocked on my door, etc.), because of my superbly low self-esteem after years of failure and my continued willingness to not put any effort.

As summer came to end, my depression began to tailspin. One of the ways I'd distract myself from misery (I've never drank or smoked to distract myself, and I'm not interested in doing so) was by watching movies. All movies have romance. I have never had romance. I was depressed. Notions began to take hold and grow, desperation was the fruit and the last month and a half but another harvest of regret.

Add to this that because of the lack of much social activity in my life, over the past two years my personal hygiene habits have also degenerated. My room is an absolute mess, during the worst times I have delivery sushi boxes a week old stacked where my textbooks should be, bags of chips all around my desk and laptop, papers everywhere, clothes everywhere, bags unpacked, etc. etc. 

I have picked up some terrible, terrible habits like picking my nose when I'm bored now...which is extremely hard for me to admit even on here...or not brushing my teeth regularly, etc.

About the only thing I do properly is that I shower often (every day or two), but I haven't washed my towel for a month and a half.

It's so despicable, I *hate* myself more than *anything* or *anyone* in the world. 

But maybe what's really bad is that I think (perhaps falsely) that I'm semi-good at hiding my condition. No one has ever cared to ask me if I'm okay, ever. My parents of course are disappointed with my performance, and I've told them more of the truth about my condition of life recently, but I just avoid talking to them out of shame.  

I feel extremely weak saying this, because I can't understand it without judging myself, and I don't expect anyone to understand it without judging me: but I have no hope for myself because I've proved again and again, that I am incapable of doing the right things at the right time for myself, leading again and again, to avoidable failure.

So, I'd like to hear your thoughts, particularly if you've gone through (or know someone about the experiences of someone who has gone through) similar stages of depravity and depression in your (their) life. A question in particular I'd really like to have an answer to: are some people just, dare I say, *born* to fail regardless of the chances given to them? At what point should one give up hope?

**tl;dr** At what point of depravity should one give up hope? At what point of depravity is it better to not exist?",15,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dvlv2/what_can_you_share_about_your_own_experience/,1287912924
dvp94,depression,viciouscycles,Need advice about my family...,"I am hoping to get some advice about what to do about my family from those who suffer from mental illness and have a non-understanding/supportive family. I apologize, but this is going to be long. I am 26 years old. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety on and off since I was around 13 years old. I was going to go into my history of depression, but it was too long, so if you have questions, please ask and I will answer to help clarify things.

I was unemployed from June to October 13 when I started a short term temp position, but I expressed my interest in staying with the company and thankfully I was offered a temp to perm position, so now I am working full time and like what I do and the people/environment there. 

I've been struggling a lot with my family and how they perceive me. I grew up (and still even now) hearing from my father ""You need a thicker skin"" ""Don't be so sensitive"" ""You need to learn to cope better"" ""You need better coping skills or you won't make it in the real world"". All this time I've been trying to do just that and trying to feel like I have control over the depression and that I can ""beat it"", but obviously it always comes back anyway. Now I'm finally beginning to realize I don't have that control and it's mostly chemically based and I have to treat it with medication, much like I have to treat my diabetes (Type 1) with insulin injections every day and taking a pill for my under active thyroid. 

My sister thinks I am a selfish brat that uses my medical condition as an excuse. My mother, while understanding of my physical medical problems (her mother had diabetes), isn't very understanding of my mental ones. My sister really doesn't understand any and thinks I use them as an excuse to get out of doing things. I recently had to back out of helping with making wedding decorations because I got sick and have a shitty immune system due to the diabetes. I was also trying to be considerate and not spread it around since there were going to be quite a few people there, including young children. But apparently after I backed out so I could stay home and get better, my sister flipped out and was bitching about me to her wedding planner, who told my mother, who told me. But it's not like I haven't done anything to help out with the wedding. In fact, this happens a lot...my mom tells me all the negative things my sister says or my dad says. She always starts it with ""Maybe I shouldn't say this, but..."" ""I'm not sure if you'll want to hear this but..."" and so forth. It just makes me think ""If you know it's not a good thing to say, then why say it?"" She even recently told my boyfriend in private how thankful she was that he was ""taking care of me"" while I was unemployed (which made him really uncomfortable; he's been buying me food) and said she knew I ""would"" do the same for him (even though I *have* already) and then later decided even though she said it to him in private, she felt the need to tell me about it anyway. I felt it was inappropriate.

My dad is just a very rational and logical person. He doesn't understand strong emotions. I've always been an emotional person and he's always made me feel shitty for it. He has this perceived stage of life you should be in at a certain age and if you don't fit into that stage perfectly, there is something wrong with you. I struggled with math a lot growing up (but excelled at English subjects), and he'd constantly make me feel like shit for it and say things like ""You're *how* old now and don't know this yet?!"" (Because the fact that I went from Catholic, to public, to Catholic, to public school had nothing to do with the type of education I received....)

My mom has always compared me to my sister a lot (yet she denies it). My friends in high school saw how much she'd compare me to her and how proud she was of my sister and would question me about it, before I even brought it up. She brags about my sister's artistic skills constantly and goes on and on about it, but of course me being without any talent, she has nothing to brag about. She even admitted to me that she has a hard time explaining to people what I do for work, when I've explained my jobs to her several times in the past. She talks about my sister even to *my* friends. I can remember bringing over a friend and she just sat there talking about my sister the entire time and then after we left he said ""What was that all about? I never even met or spoke to your sister...."" He also pointed out that she has several pictures displayed in the living room of my sister and her fiance, but none of me and my boyfriend (we've been together for 3 1/2 years). It's always been kind of obvious to me that she doesn't consider my relationship with my boyfriend as ""valid"" as my sister's relationship.

Yesterday I went to their house and apparently my sister was getting her final fitting done there. When I walked in, the seamstress was packing up to leave. My mom came down stairs and said ""You missed all the fun!"" and I said ""That's ok."" and she said ""Thanks..."" sarcastically which made me question why she said that and she said ""For making it seem so unimportant!"" and I was really confused and said ""I'm sorry, I didn't know it was a requirement for me to be here for this?"" and she got really defensive and said ""It was a joke! You were supposed to take it as a joke!"" and I got frustrated and walked away and said ""Whatever."" and she said ""That's better!"" This is not the first time she did something like this. She always makes snide remarks and can never just say something nice and leave it at that. After I got my last job that worked out, she said ""I'm happy for you, but if you don't end up liking it, can you *please* not leave until you have another job lined up?"" And it just aggravates me more because she seemed incredibly supportive of my decision to leave before, and only after I wasn't getting interviews for months did her opinion change. Yesterday, my dad gave me an article about hunting for jobs and I was reading it when he wasn't around and asked my mom why he was giving me an article like this when I already had a job and she said ""Well...in the past we know how your jobs start out great but then you hate them and leave, so he's just preparing you for the future..."" and I just got so angry and said ""YES I KNOW! YOU KEEP TELLING ME THINGS I HAVE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT! I AM IN THERAPY AND GOING TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST SO PLEASE STOP BRINGING THINGS LIKE THIS UP!"" and she just snorted and said ""Guess I've been told...""

Anyway, my therapist and I both agree that my family will never understand me or the things I struggle with internally. They will never understand what it means to suffer from depression/anxiety. My parents have never had problems loaning me money or helping me financially (but they still make me feel inadequate about it), but the understanding and emotional support has never been there. I have come to the realization that I want to get them out of my life. I don't want them in my life as much or at all, but my sister's wedding is in two weeks, so this will have to wait. 

After the wedding, I'm not sure how to go about telling my family to stay out of my life. I don't know how to tell them that they are what is keeping me from recovery and trying to feel better about myself. I don't know if it would be permanent or temporary. It's just really hard and confusing for me that my boyfriend and friends think I'm this strong amazing person for dealing with so much in my life (even stuff outside of my family issues), yet my family perceives me so differently. And I know that once I say ""Get out of my life"" (not necessarily in those words), that it will only further prove their perception of me (and my mom will play the guilt trip card), which I really don't want. But I know at the same time after over a decade of dealing with this, they'll never understand me or the mental illness. I get told there is nothing wrong with me by my boyfriend, friends, and therapist, yet my family constantly tells me or insinuates it as the opposite.

dvt4h,depression,bawb,Am I depressed or what?  Please tell me.,"For a while now I *feel* like doing a lot of things, but I never *want* to do them.  Whatever I force myself to do I forget about after a couple of days.

I avoid meeting new people, but *I can't wait* to hang out with people I do know when opportunities arise.

I think about buying booze to make myself feel good at the end of many days (sometimes most).  Usually, I end up buying 2 or 3 beers and drink to surfing the internet and laughing my ass off while talking to myself.

I never feel right about myself, unless I'm drinking or stoned - then it feels like I can think rather clearly, and that's the time to act.  I *try* to act while I'm in those states but it's usually too late to do anything positive or progressive - since it's usually around 2 am.

Then I sleep until noon and wake up, and the only things I feel happy about are eating a nice breakfast, having a smoke, and checking whatever out on the internet for a bit.  Then I get into the old routine unless a friend calls and wants to hang out.

I seem to have lost all of my discipline as well.  When it's starting to get late I'm always thinking about going to sleep, but I never do.  I always end up going to sleep well past midnight.  Or when I try to force myself to workout, or start a pet project like a blog or something, I either never get around to starting it or I abandon it very soon.

When I'm around people I rarely feel comfortable, I can't express myself verbally, and I'm always either bewildered and confused or one of ""those guys"".  

Around friends I feel infantile and weak.  Like a boy who is around people with real lives.  Or a parasite.

I can't seem to find anything fun to do with my friends, and at most I can only do what is relaxing.  That usually involves simply drinking and talking and showing each other stuff on youtube.  I rarely feel playful.

I feel like one of those morbidly obese people who lay in bed all day and talk about how they can't live the way they do anymore.  I even cry from time to time, and weep whenever I watch an old Disney movie or something by Pixar.

Also, my favorite band is Nirvana.

dw680,depression,Poison1990,Trying to express how I see life,"Picture yourself standing on a cliff. Below you you can see the valley floor stretch out to the horizon. 

You see people. Millions of them all formed in lines. 

Near the foot of the cliff you stand on, are gates with professions written in banners over head. People hang around, pick a gate and then get in line. They wait in line slowly moving forwards toward the horizon until eventually they die. 

From where I stand I can't see why they do this, but they do. Some lines have longer queues than others. Some move at different speeds. Some have less people. But they all reach the horizon and disappear. 


I am asked, which line do you choose? What do you want to do with your life? how do you want to earn your keep?

I feel I can't make the choice. I want to turn and run. I'd sooner put a gun to my head than become part of this mechanised march towards death. Who says we gain anything simply by existing? we get jobs and live our lives. We don't achieve much. Only the few will be happy. Before you know it you have reached your end and you're lying on your deathbed wondering how you got there so fast.

The sad thing is, that while I toy with indecision eventually I will be allocated a line. I might not like it. It might be crappy.

dw7f2,depression,[deleted],The nature of depression and apathy.,"I've been becoming increasingly antisocial, therefore I know that this is the only opportunity my thoughts will be given to exist outside of my mind. I don't understand why I feel it's necessary that I not be the only one to know them, this isn't self consistent with anything I'm going to describe.

It may be important to note that this depressed state is entirely illogical. This is what makes it interesting to me. For all intents and purposes I have no rational reason to be in my current state of mind. I'm young and healthy, I have a stable income and a stable home, I'm a graduate student and I'm intellectually stimulated, and there isn't anything in particular that can be deemed depressing about my life. The sheer irrationality of it makes it all but impossible for me to find this at least to some degree thought provoking.

The foremost and also most interesting aspect of my current state of mind is the insurmountable internal swell of apathy that has been permeating into all aspects of myself. Allow me to elaborate through example.

The first activity I began losing interest in was any hobby of mine that I had previously enjoyed. I used to be rather fond of tae kwon do, brewing, occasional rock climbing, and cooking. Those were the first things to begin to taper off with time, until I stopped participating in any of them all together. To an even greater extreme, I've also lost all enthusiasm for food in general. I've hardly been eating, and I'm largely apathetic to it. I essentially only eat if the degree of starvation is such that it is causing irritating physical pain, making sleep difficult, or that I am becoming so light headed that I frequently feel as though I will faint while doing things as normally innocuous as standing up or riding my bike to the office. This has caused me to lose nearly 30lbs, I was not overweight to begin with.

The next thing to begin wearing away was my enthusiasm for politics. I had previously enjoyed staying current on political issues and found ideas in a political context intriguing and mentally stimulating. I've been becoming apathetic to the degree that I no longer read news whatsoever, when I previously used to spend at least an hour a day and frequently more concerning myself with news and politics.

The next facet of my life to be broadly spattered with the indiscriminate heaving of apathy was any affection I previously had for my cats. I have two two-year-old cats that I have become completely indifferent towards, possibly even further to the extent that I have begun to irrationally resent them. I've decided that I am not capable of caring for them, and it is likely best that they be placed anywhere else. I'm planning on giving them up to whichever nearby shelter will take them. At first I had thought that I wanted to surrender them to a no-kill shelter, but I realized that these are universally packed to the gills right now, to such an extent that many no-kill shelters have begun surrendering their cats to kill shelters themselves. I also realized a mildly disturbing truth, which is that I am emotionless regarding whether they survive or not.

The next chronological detail awash and crumbling in apathy is my enthusiasm for school work. I'm in a competitive scientific graduate program, which I entered with a hearty devotion, and has subsequently been degraded into an irritation and inescapable nuisance. I find myself reluctantly leaving my apartment to sit in my office, generally arriving late. Once there I find myself often staring at my work for large quantities of time, making no attempt to progress. Simply sitting, staring, and not thinking. I've fallen behind on my work, to a degree that I'm not certain that I am capable of returning to the schedule I had hoped to keep to. I don't particularly care if it gets done, and I don't particularly care if my work progresses.

My relationship with my family has also been suffering, and the degree to which I alienate them is growing with time. I no longer talk to them voluntarily. I used to either call one of my parents or my grandparents nearly every day. That, or they would call me and I would be willing to hold a decent conversation. After some time I stopped calling willfully. Now I don't answer if they call, or respond to messages or emails of any sort. Towards the end of talking to my parents, I would be surprisingly hostile. Now I feel it's best if I stop communication entirely.

The last, and by far the most painful, aspect of my life to be swathed in the now universal and inescapable indifference is my relationship with my long term girlfriend. We've been together for nearly 4 years now, and are currently maintaining our relationship at a distance. We had been talking about getting married some time in the next few years. I moved a considerable distance to pursue my graduate education, and so now we hardly see each other. I used to talk with her at least once a day, trying to video chat as much as possible. Then I started losing interest in the video chats. Next I stopped wanting to hold a conversation on the phone, and communicated in short text messages. Now I've stopped communicating entirely. I had previously been very optimistic about our future, hoping that sooner or later she would move in and we could continue our previous course of things when we used to live together. Now I'm losing that hope, and bit by bit the image of my future is being blotched with only a bleak and solitary future. It's becoming difficult to imagine anything else for me.

Now my enthusiasm for any facet of my life is essentially dissolved into the vast expanses of apathy. I've begun becoming indifferent to my waking hours, spending more time asleep than ever. The sleep, however, is not very sound. In reality I feel poorly rested perpetually, even though my time spent sleeping has increased dramatically. It's generally fragmented and unsatisfying. Because of this, I spend my waking hours inundated with a dense haze enveloping my thoughts and actions. I feel as though I'm losing my mind, and my behavior has become erratic and unusual.

The strangest part of this ordeal is that I am not optimistic about improvement and don't particularly care if it happens. Even though I am thoroughly aware of the degree to which my state has worsened, I'm not agitated by it and have no motivation to reverse it. This is a very strange series of events that has been transpiring for me, and one to which I can offer no explanation. I don't feel that I am capable of understanding it, and that in itself is something that I find interesting. It seems by definition impossible. It's rather eerie to consider that once this course of action is put into motion, it becomes nearly absurd to consider any alternative as it is a self-feeding process, which will irreversibly progress forward until every possible consumable is enveloped. Resection of the rot requires the rot to first be cured. I've entered a paradox, which may be why this seems at least mildly interesting.

I appreciated collecting my ideas, and laying them out in a chronological progression, if for no other reason than for the sake of organization. I feel as though I have a greater definition of the issue at hand, even if I can generate no further comprehension for the reason among the nonsense.",7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dw7f2/the_nature_of_depression_and_apathy/,1288032986
dwc91,depression,Betterbee,Help taking the first step ,"Hey Reddit, 

(23yr old male - Australia)
This is not my first post on reddit, but I've never really opened up to people about my depression. I've recently started making some small steps, I opened up to a friend about some of the things on my mind, and she surprised me by how accepting she was about the thing si have done. (these are personal failings I am referring to. I've not filled out a tax return since I started working, flunked out of uni because I was too scared of going to classes, and started lieing to my, then, girlfriend and family about my life situation. I maintained that I was still in uni, but eventually broke down and confessed to my girlfriend about what had happened. It damaged the relationship, she was understandbly hurt but stuck with me. 

But the confrontation didn't help me and I fell further into the same patterns to 'protect' myself against the shame of anyone else knowing about my failings. Eventually I managed to push my girlfriend away enough the she broke up with me, and I crashed. I stopped going to work, and just stayed in my room. I lost my job, my lease, I aquired about $500 in debts to utility companies which I still have as of yet to pay off (tanked my credit rating) and had to move back in with my parents for a year. Even when living with them I couldn't open up and talk about my problems. My dad tried to get me on centrelink for which I was eligible after a while, but I tried to deceive him, I said I'd put in paper work for my application when I hadn't. There was no reason not to, besides my own feelings of shame and guilt. 

 I was a burden on my parents, and I wanted desperately to get back on my feet and find a job but I was in not position to do such a thing (my dad lives on a stretch of isolated highway in the country) Centrelink was the best option as I could at least give a little back, but something about being back on the doll terrified me. Like it was a step backwards, like I was a kid fresh out of school. So I lied, held out until he found out and then there was a shit storm before I moved to my Mums.

Things were a bit better here - I got on centrelink, a doc put me on medication for depression, and I started to get back on track emotionally. I went off the meds after 8 months as it didn't feel like they were helping.

It's been two years since then and I've though that I was making progress, but I realise I haven't changed and I still carry the demons around with me. Worse still I look at myself today and I have no life so to speak. I've stopped contacting all my friends, given up on making new ones, I dont even think about women in a serious way anymore. At least I wouldn't inflict my company on one for whom I had any real feelings. I go to work and I come home and sit on my computer. I realise I don't even browse the web for a coherent prupose or hobby. I just vacuum up whatever vaguely interesting information I come across on reddit.

Last night my sis and brother in law were devising ways I could approach a girl at work who's cute. I said maybe 5 words for that whole conversation, and all I wanted to do was open up to them and explain who I am and what I'm feeling. But I couldn't and I didn't. How do I tell them that I find myself crying in the sheds at work when no one is around? That I can't think seriously about a girl because what kind of relationship can I offer someone else when I can't manage my own affairs?

I guess I'm just tired of it all. I look back to the person I was even 5 years ago and I don't see the resemblence anymore. I would like to start seeing a therapist but I'm out country and have no licence to get around. So I guess I'm asking for help and advice if you've got any to spare, Reddit. I don't know what to do, and I think it's time to admit that I'm terrified that this is person condemned to be for the rest of my life.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, and despite it all I'm sure I've breezed over a lot. But any help from you guys and girls would be unreal. Thank you in advance. And I apologise for the formatting, grammar, etc - I had to type this on my iPhone from work.

Tldr
I've spent years keeping everything in and it's destroying me. I need to open up to my family - they're the most important thing to me inthe world and I'm driving them away. Please help me find a way to open up

dwcjr,depression,doublebubblexx,I hate myself,"My life is one big mess. I don't know what is wrong with me, but I have become this anxious, nervous, socially awkward insecure girl. I'm 22 and this is supposed to be the best time of my life and it's turned into me having no close friends at all, no one that I can really talk to, and having a really shitty family life.

I blame myself completely. I don't know how to relate to people and I don't know how to talk to them anymore. I have all these expectations of what friends and family are supposed to be like and when a situation occurs that is against my expectations I lash out. To my family especially, that is when I'm at my worst. When I think of the person I am I NEVER see myself as being capable of being the monster I am when my parents or family upsets me. These are supposed to be my people, the people I am supposed to be comfortable around and able to talk to and I can't at all. I feel like they constantly judge me and demean me because they want me to be a better person and they have no idea how to get me to be.

I am just so upset with my life, the person I have become, and the people that are in my life and I don't know what to do.

The reason I am writing this is because I just got into it with my mom and dad. They get home from work and I simply wanted to tell them that my uncles very young very sexy very nothing like me wife called and left a message asking me to hang out with her. I have nothing in common with her, she makes me feel really uncomfortable when I'm with her alone like having a cig outside or something bc I don't know what to say to her or anything. She just makes me feel insecure about myself more than anything. So I just told my parents that she called and they begin hassling me into hanging out with her. ""well maybe you should go hang out with her. shes a lot better than any of your friends and she's family. it will give you something to do etc."" and this just set me off. for some reason i fucking flew off the handle. raised my voice to levels i didn't know were possible. it makes me feel so shitty inside that they responded like that rather than just laughing at it like i did. they should know by now that i don't like being around her that much. like i said, it makes no sense to me why this hurt me so bad, but it really did. and it turned in to me shouting about how they dont understand me, they never will, they aren't supportive or understanding parents, which as much as they want to be they really arent, and that i can't communicate with them.

it sucks. everything sucks right now. i need to hear from you guys. how do i deal with this. how can i stop being so psychotic and insecure?

to boot - i'm overweight, not confidant in myself at all, have used fake pictures of girls for years online to get guys to talk to me and i have actual long distance relationships with them until they find out or i tell them meanwhile, there are several guys i know on facebook that live around me that want to be with me but im too scared to meet up with them in person bc my fb picture makes me seem a lot thinner than i am -- i am just so fucked up in the head. what should i do? please help",24,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dwcjr/i_hate_myself/,1288052849

For the past few hours I've been sitting here in my dorm room, trying to keep from panicking and crying more. My eyes hurt and I just want it to stop. It feels like there are waves of anxiety and depression just trying to drown me, and I've been struggling against them all week. These past few days especially have been tough and I don't know why. I think maybe it's because I think I have nothing, no friends, no one to turn to, but rationally that's false. I have a few friends here in college, and I know there are people back home who care about me, but I just feel hopelessly alone no matter what I do. I'm afraid I'm irking my friends I do have here, because they don't know what to do with my anxiety or moods. At first it was the homesickness (I'm a freshman) and then it was just general feelings of being sad or moody and now it's fucking waves of anxiety that make me feel like I'm going to die. I'm rambling now, but I can't formulate coherent sentences, let alone type them. I am seeking counseling, I've been to two sessions with the counselors they have here, and I have another one tomorrow. I just... I don't know.

dwhgg,depression,sad_dude_needin_help,Starting to loose myself...,"I used to have an incredibly romanticized view of the world.  As I went through highschool, I constantly drew comparisons to myself and the likes of Han Solo and John Cusack.  Although a late-bloomer on the dating scene, by the time I was a Senior, I would never be a few weeks without a new female love interest.  On the flip side of that, I had alot of bad stuff going on in my personal life, Break-ups, divorce, my kitteh died, etc, so it was a year of ups and downs.

Now I'm in college, and I've never felt so empty.

I spent the last half hour going through songs on my iTunes library looking for something to trigger even the slightest emotion.  I'm full of apathy, and I hate it.  I hate not feeling anything.  I'd settle for the lowest low I felt last year over this, because at least then I felt SOMETHING.

College is by no means bad.  I've got friends I like, I'm involved with groups I enjoy.  I haven't been with a girl yet which is kind of annoying, but then again I haven't really tried very much.

But despite all this, I feel like the me I once knew and enjoyed being is slowly slipping away, and being replaced with this empty shell of a person.

It's especially uncomfortable for me because this was supposed to be a time when the rain-cloud that hovered around my Senior year became a thing of the past and I was free to move on and be happy again.

Has anyone ever dealt with something similar?  Around this time frame?  Is it a transitional thing?  Any thoughts on the issue. Please.  I want to feel human again (pain, happiness, whatever, just not this nothingness)

dwt2l,depression,depressedmi,Please help me help myself. [financial/medicaid help],"Sorry if this seems jumbled; I tried to group thoughts that were alike but may have failed.

I am a 20 year old living in southwest Michigan. I am 99% sure I am clinically depressed and I have been for as long as I can remember. I have been really stressed out, especially lately. I had a bad childhood and my father is mentally unstable as well. I am sure there is something wrong; even though it's 'normal' to me, I can't imagine how everyone could cope with this kind of depression and stress all the time. I feel it's time to get professional help. I've been able to cope with all this for so long, but it's getting to the point where my coping skills have run out. I want to try to get anti-depressants, but I cannot afford them, seeing as my income is $0 a year.

I haven't been to the doctor since I was 12, not even for a check up. My family is made up of very poor laborers. I am in community college full time and I live with my dad, who made $17k last year. I do not have any form of health insurance.

I'm pretty sure I'm still technically counted as a dependent to my father. That being said, is there any way for me to get some sort of help (like medicaid) without him knowing or coming with? As I said before, he is not stable himself, and he would basically freak out if he knew I was trying to get anti-depressants. And he is already frustrated/disappointed in me a lot, so I don't want to frustrate him even further. I told him once that I am depressed and I want to go to the doctor, but he said that we cannot afford it, and gave me some over-the-counter herbal remedy which I really don't think would help. After that, the subject was basically dropped and I really don't want to bring it up to him again.

I feel like if I try to get help, they are going to need income information from my dad because I think I am still technically a dependent depite the fact that I am an adult in the eye of the law.

What are my options, if any? I don't know anything about the medical system. All I know is that I don't have any money (I may be able to scrounge up a little money each month), and I need help without my father knowing. I realize this may be asking a lot, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to post here and see if I can get some help regarding the issue.",5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dwt2l/please_help_me_help_myself_financialmedicaid_help/,1288125279
dww5h,depression,throwaway94251,On the verge of losing it. ,"I don't know what to do. I've been feeling terribly for the past year or so and can't see it letting up anytime soon. Superficially my life is ideal--I'm at an Ivy, am earning excellent grades, have a caring SO. But every day is a tremendous ordeal. I hate waking up and having to face the day every morning. I have very few friends and my limited contact with them is dwindling because I can't bring myself to socialize. I am facing several important exams this week and I already know I'll fail one of them, which is a big deal because I base my self-worth entirely on academics and every year I'm terrified of having my GPA drop below whatever it was last year because then I'd really hate myself. (I really hope I'm not coming off as arrogant by referencing academics so much, it's just that they form such a large part of my self-concept--I'm not intellectually gifted at all, it's just that I have no social life and work harder than most of my peers.) 

I'm beginning to think maybe this is life. I feel like I'm perpetually waiting for something to happen, something to validate me. I would go on waiting, but I'm beginning to find this unsustainable...I'm exhausted every day no matter how much I sleep. I don't feel like doing anything. If there were some way for me to stay in bed all day I'd gladly do it. Also, I'm beginning to lash out at my SO for no reason whatsoever. I make unreasonable demands (knowing they're unreasonable) and get angry when he fails to meet them. I'm lethargic and not any fun to be around. I really can't face another 40 years (or however long I live) of this. 

Anyway, after this week's exams I'll either keep trudging along, nothing having changed, or lose my shit completely. I don't know what will happen. Maybe I just won't get out of bed for a week, fuck up my GPA and go home.

Not to mention the fact that I procrastinated like I always do, so the grand plans I was working on had to be pared down over and over again.

I have a lot of friends. Members of the opposite sex like me a lot, almost an unreasonable amount, to the point where it feels like a huge farce. I feel like most of it is superficial and I only have a few real friends that would help me out in a pinch.

I'm still getting over my last relationship (it's been about five months) and I don't know why it hurts so bad still. She wasn't even that great, or so I keep telling myself. It probably sounds strange and backwards but I feel like women use me for sex.

I publicly comport myself with incredible confidence considering how I feel a lot of the time. I don't know how that works, because sometimes all I want to do is sleep and never wake up. While I could have been working on my project this morning I stayed in bed and told myself over and over that I was a loathsome worm.

dxkai,depression,alouatta,Help with mom's depression (and my resultant misery),"I'm going to try not to ramble. 

Depression runs in my family--my (maternal) grandfather had it, my mother and aunt have it, my cousin and sister have it, and I'm bipolar(II). So mental illness is an accepted part of life in my family. I had a very hard year last year and decided to move back home to be closer to my family (I lived hours away). Little did I realize how bad my mother has gotten.

She's always had ""depression,"" but I swear she's bipolar or has something that is degenerative. She barely functions, takes a shit-ton of meds, has ridiculous mood swings, is a hoarder. She makes everyone around her miserable--no one wants to spend time with her anymore. I love her, but she disgusts me. 

She's a well educated woman (MA in psych, of all things) and will acknowledge that she needs help one day, then the next get angry when I suggest some places to start.

Examples of the insanity I'm currently living with:

* she's in the bathroom right now, crying for no apparent reason. If I ask her why, she'll say nothing. If I don't ask her, it's because I don't care

* she filled the back of my car with empty shoe boxes to ""put stuff in."" I threw them out an she flipped

* My father has to give her an allowance--she overdraws their account all the time (it's gotten to the point where he keeps a separate account)

*she won't leave the bed for days (except to use the bathroom)

* she takes all sorts of drugs--dexadrine, provigil, migraine meds, trazadone, god knows what else. She has rx's for them all, but it would be a miracle for her to actually follow the dosage instructions

*she takes everything you say as a personal attack (e.g. I told her I was taking my father to work and she blew-up b/c I do everything for him. Well, yeah, she won't do anything and is completely unreliable)

It goes on and on. We're constantly tip-toeing around her. We live our lives trying to keep her from shattering into a million pieces.  My father and I are at our wits' end; my sister and brother won't come over--their SO's can't stand family gatherings. We might go for a week or two where things seem normal, but then she just starts behaving eratically again. She had a long-time psychiatrist who retired over the summer. As far as anyone is aware, she hasn't replace him, so who know what she will do when her refills run out. Most of my immediate family think even her psychiatrist gave-up on her. The last few years it seemed more like he was filling her rx's to keep her placated than out of belief they would help her.

I guess I partly wanted to vent, but any ideas how to help her would be awesome. I honestly don't think she could even minimally function without my father, and she's driving him into the ground.

edit: she's driving me into the ground too. Over the last couple of years, I have had a very difficult time gaining some sort of control over my own depression. I'm basically failing out of school--I was on probation this semester (I'm taking on-line courses), but I'm failing my courses. I don't know how to tell my parents. I've been in school 7 years, and I've basically given-up. Even if I graduated tomorrow, I'd never get into grad school and the only thing I'm qualified to do is work in retail. Moving home was supposed to help me, so I'd be closer to a support system (I don't really have and friends). I honestly don't know how much longer I can stand it, but I don't have a choice. I work ~30+ hours a week, but don't earn enough to get an apartment of my own (I used to live with roommates). I really feel like I've basically given-up on the hope that I can be successful and happy. Right now, I just want to get through a week without having to deal with my mother's mood swings.

I'm 23, male, in California. Financially, I'm near-broke. I have around $200 left in the bank. I'm working as a freelance web designer (oDesk), making ~$300/week but this will only probably last for one more month. My debt is around $2,000 (credit cards and personal).

**MY HOBBY/CAREER**
I was working in LA with the job title ""Junior Programmer"", but my responsibilities were way more than that. I was a designer, web developer, hardware/software/network guy, database admin, etc. I used to love it, but the feeling slowly evolved into a cold, loathsome void. I learned before: ""Don't turn your hobby into a job; then it becomes a job."" or something like that, and that's what happened. I lost my passion.

Today, I am doing freelance projects, focused more on web design instead of programming. I snatched one small gig so far, but it pays enough for everyday needs. There's just no job security, and there's still no passion anymore.

I gave most of my life dedicated to computers and trying to know the in and out of it, but I'm tired. I lost the motivation. I am no longer interested enough. I want to change career path but don't know where to begin.

**LOVE LOST**
I met her in college, 6 years ago. I was too stupid to make a move on her, and just kept my feelings even though our communication slowed down to a halt after college.

One night, I mistakenly buzzed her in Yahoo! Messenger. She said, ""What's up?"" and we just started talking again. It turns out her then-boyfriend dumped her because she's too far away (she's now in Thailand, I'm in California, her then-bf is here too but I don't know where). We just talked and comforted each other (we were both depressed then) over the phone/Skype/YM/etc. Things got pretty good, so I decided to surprise her there. Pooled up for a plane ticket, hotel fees and pocket money. It was really stupid of me to not tell anyone about it (except for one of my bestfriend) and not knowing anyone else in Thailand, but I have the will and motivation to do that trip so I still did.

Went to the place where she works, and she was really surprised and happy that I visited her. Stayed there for 3 days, but nothing really happened (not that I want something sexual to happen, I respect her and wanted that relationship to have a solid foundation). One thing to take note of: I did not explicitly told what I felt for her (she told me later that it was unnecessary for my situation cause she already felt the same way somehow).

We went back to our home country (I scheduled my surprise visit right before her/my work vacation), planned a college reunion party which was fun but apparently, I got *too* drunk and found out she hates drunk person so I totally screwed up what we have or supposed to have. She ended up dating one of her other guy friend who turns out to be playing her.

Things ended up worse when we talked over chat. I told her the reason I changed a lot and started becoming a player is her choosing the other guy over me. She told me I was full of myself. Told her I wouldn't talk to her again.

Now I couldn't even talk to her. I have a new girlfriend but it's a long distance relationship with really no spark at all. Truth is, I still have feelings for the girl in Thailand.

**FRIENDS**
I have a small group of friends who I can really trust with my life. Unfortunately, they are on the other side of the world, except for one who is 10 minutes away but is always with his girlfriend. I don't know anyone else and this depression only made my socially-awkwardness worse.

**THE JOB I FAILED TO GET**
It was some sort of fancier tech support job. I found the ad in Craigslist, and was really interested, so I polished my resume really well, wrote a very specific and detailed cover letter, submitted it and I got back a set of questions which then answered with all my best abilities. Phone interview came and apparently, I screwed it up because I was not too good at conversations.

Question is, if I already did my best and I still failed, what more reasons do I have to exist?

EDIT: One more thing I noticed is, I tend to compare my knowledge of one technology with others and I get disappointed that I cannot be on the same level as them and when I try to, I get overwhelmed by all the stuff I need to know, and just give up then and there.

EDIT: I do have other interests: automotive, architecture, structural engineering, boxing.


**ORIGINAL POST (NO NEED TO READ)**

Before I applied for the job, I totally cleaned up my resume, made it ""fit"" for the requirements, wrote a very specific cover letter, etc. Long story short, I gave it my best.

Now, after a phone interview, I was told I did not pass because my conversational skills are not that good, although I did great on the written part.

I gave it my best and I failed. I failed at life. I am not good at anything, in fact, I do not have any strengths. I am a mediocre person. I know a bit of everything, I do not have any special talents.

How do I get back to society? How do I pull myself up?

This all happened after getting rejected by a girl (I went to visit her, traveled to a different country, and she ended up with another guy who I found out played her later).

I have very few friends. But they are not here, in California. I want to go back home but I can't. Not enough savings, and I still have around $2,000 debts, credit card and personal, not to mention the money needed for the plane tickets.

I don't know, I'm confused. I am basically writing anything that comes to mind. I'm afraid of what's coming to me in the future.

I don't want this life anymore. I am sick of being very non-sociable, but I cannot find anyone else to talk to. One of my best friend (and the only friend I have here in California) is always hanging out with his GF.

I call myself a programmer, yet, I cannot or do not even have one finished program. I give up too easily if I get bored or encounter a difficult problem.

dxs5b,depression,uncletbag,Overwhelmed,"Hi, everyone. This is my first post on reddit; I've been having a tough time recently and I just wanted to share. I'm one of those people who has a tough time discussing things like this with my family/friends.

Perhaps I should begin with where I was one year ago, and where I am today. I would kind of like just to get it all out there and never talk about it again.

One year ago, I tried to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation. I grew up in a conservative environment in the South, and that, in many ways, shaped an intense self-hatred that developed for 24 years. During that time, I tried to cope with my problems by ignoring them. After a number of failed relationships with girls, I honestly planned on remaining in the closet and being alone forever.

In college I had the opportunity to be myself, but I shut myself down and refused to admit that I was gay. Of course, the loneliness and isolation that I felt ate away at me year after year.

When I graduated college and began my first job, my friends all began getting married and starting families, which only intensified my feelings of loneliness.

When things reached a breaking point, I decided that I should try and deal with my sexuality once and for all, so I came out to my best friend at the time (who worked at the same company). Unfortunately, he did not react well. He told me that it didn't bother him, but we stopped hanging out after that. The worst part is that he outed me to several of my coworkers. After that, a once friendly work environment became awkward and tense.

I felt more isolated than ever. I had given up hope of ever finding a positive solution to my problem, so I decided to kill myself. I bought a nitrogen tank, some trash bags, a hose and some sleeping pills. I planned everything out, I didn't want my death to be messy because I didn't to hurt my family more than I had to.

I said goodbye to my friends and family (via text, of all things), took a fistful of sleeping pills, and turned on the gas. Death was supposed to arrive in five minutes, but the sleeping pills didn't kick in. I couldn't keep the bag over my head without instinctively pulling it off again due to the feeling of suffocation.

Fifteen minutes later, the cops showed up at my door, and I was taken to a mental health facility for a week. I quit my job after that (my boss to this day doesn't know why I quit other than “medical reasons”), and I moved back in with my folks.

After that, things got so much better. My folks were supportive of me in every way. I stayed with them for almost a year because I couldn't find another job. But during that time, I started dating. My first boyfriend was a pilot, and we were together for 8 months. We had both never dated another guy before, and, as weird as I'm sure it sounds to some of you, there was something very sweet and innocent about the whole thing.

Looking back, those were some of my happier times of my life. It was tough not being able to work, but it was nice to have something that I thought I would never have.

The work thing is what eventually drove us apart, I believe. I had nothing to do all day, I spent time working out and playing games, but it's like he and I were not on equal footing. I felt inadequate and I'm sure that came across. I would often be negative, because I was stressed about not working.

We ended up drifting apart. It is hard to watch someone who once cared about you slowly lose that spark. The relationship ended somewhat “mutually,” but honestly I was, by far, more hurt by the whole thing. He was the one good thing in my life at that time.

Fast forward to a few months after our break-up, and I am enrolled in grad school. I finally have a THING, I don't feel lost. But at the same time, he has moved to the Middle East to work for an airline out there and, as much as I hate to say it, has in many ways forgotten about me. He mentioned before he left that maybe we could start over in THREE years when he returns to the US, but I know in my heart that that won't happen. If he really wanted to be with me, he would have stayed.

Grad school is stressful. I live far away from campus and don't have any time to be social. Most of my classmates are pretty serious, and I haven't made any good friends like I did when I was an undergraduate. I spend most of my time driving between school and my part-time tutoring job.

And, at the moment, I feel overwhelmed. I am incredibly lonely. I don't want to slip back into the depression that dealt with for 24 years, but I am having trouble coping with a life that is all work and no fun. I haven't been able to get over my last relationship because I haven't had anything to move on with.

I don't have any real friends here unfortunately. I want to make time to meet people, but most of my efforts have been thwarted by my schedule.

I feel like I am on the verge of cracking. Last night, I stayed up all night completing an assignment and when I came home I crashed into a ball and asked myself “Who am I doing this for? Where is this going to take me?”

Meanwhile, I see pictures of my ex on fb enjoying his new life, traveling the world with his friends and possible new interests. I can't help but look at my life and become incredibly depressed. My life is a lab underground. It is books and homework and loneliness. I feel abandoned by him, and everyone else.

I want to stay positive, I want to push forward. I just don't know how much more I can do in these circumstances. I feel like I'm always pushing a boulder away.

Anyway, that was incredibly long. I apologize. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it, and I am open to any advice you guys may offer.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dxs5b/overwhelmed/,1288283760

My boss is quite demanding and I'm supposed to finish analysing data to write a paper on it this winter. We started the project a year ago and I feel like I should know how to do much more by now. There wasn't anyone in my lab who know how to do the tasks I was asked to do, I could go ask outside people but somehow it's harder, and my professor also systematically said ""we don't have to take their word as gospel"" which stopped me a bit from asking too much.

I also have a family, I'm married with a kid. This doesn't let me become a typical asocial, married-to-her-work PhD student. This might be hindering me, and is definitely tiring me out.

I have no confidence in what I do. I don't feel at all like publishing any work I do because it is all lousy. I don't know how to get out of this.

My parents both are fuck ups who will never improve there lives, and have done nothing whatsoever to help me. I would be living on the streets if I had relied on them.

Ive been in and out of abusive relationships, verbally and physically, and in hindsight I had always been afraid of leaving because I wouldnt have been able to support myself. 

My on and off again SO of 4 years both come from this screwy sort of background and after a bad breakup, he went through therapy [provided by his work] and is reestablishing  a relationship with his mom. 

He's doing better at work, with his family, and he's getting in really great shape.

Ive lost my job, am struggling to pay my rent and light [we dont live together] and this period of inactiveness is causing me to gain weight and lose motivation to work out. 

I feel like his life is taking off, and mines spiraling down. I lost my car because I couldnt afford it which makes the job hunt even harder. 

The only person in my family whos doing anything with their lives is my aunt who always says she wishes she coudl help, but shes been working less so its hard for her too, but theyre always vacationing to tropical islands at the same time and her children have everything they want and need, and then some.

I just feel like I have a shitty family, and thats not unheard of, but I also feel like I have no options to do anything for myself lately.

I try talking to my boyfriend about it, but I back out because he asks ""wait, are you being gloomy and depressed again?"" which is embarassing and i retract and rephrase whatever I said.

i just have no idea what to do with my life at this point, and I need help.

I don't say this to brag or anything, just to show that the work is difficult and plentiful. As a senior, I looked forward to enjoying my last year with my friends and looking forward to graduating. But it hasn't turned out that way so far. I feel stressed constantly. I have more work on a daily basis than I've ever had, and it's taking away all my free time.

I just have no time to do anything I enjoy, and it's really starting to drain me.

I remember a description of college I read. It said ""Good grades. Social life. Sleep. Pick 2."" And I feel like that's exactly my situation. Schoolwork is #1 for me and without a decent amount of sleep, I'm a complete zombie. So I guess I've picked those two out of necessity, which has left me with almost no social life lately. Even on the weekends I feel like I just need to sleep in and relax in order to recharge from the previous week. And it's making me unhappy.

I feel down/sad/depressed all the time

I'll try and keep this short -- but I may ramble, please bare with it, I really would appreciate you guy's help:
I'm in my sophmore year of college.  I'm lonely, sad, overwhelmed, unsure about the future, undecided about everything (mainly my major... I'm thinking construction management, any thoughts on that?), and every day just blends together.  Every day is hard to get out of bed.  I'm not so deep into depression that I WON'T get out of bed, but my first thought when I do wake up is ""another day..."" or ""I can't wait till the day is over.""
I'm terribly lonely, I almost have no friends, and it was mainly because after my girlfriend from high school destroyed me, somehow I lost my social skills with both sexes.  I was never bad at making friends, and hell I had 5, give or take 1, girlfriends, but now in college I've had none :(.  I don't understand it either.  I'm really not bad looking, I like the way I look/dress.  I like the way I am and am not planning on changing who I am (a nice guy that will do anything for that one special girl, is never selfish, helps anyone when needed, gives advice to friends, is ALWAYS there, and I do mean always) for any girl.  I think of myself as a really good person.  However every girl I've tried to get to be better friends with and potentially go out with has failed miserably... which I've taken personally and thus my self esteem keeps taking a hit when this happens, to the point where I've basically stopped trying all together.. about anything.
Academically I guess I'm in decent standing.  I try really hard, which is why I'm always drained, and there are many times I just get (sorry for the strong use of word but this is really how I feel, no intention of offending anyone) raped on quizzes and exams... this just deepens my sadness.
I just want to know someone out there is going through the same, that I'm not alone... I want/need to feel cared for/loved for (and I don't mean from my family...I know they love me very much and I love them to death as well, but there's so much that can help me when I only see them once a year and am very very far from them and chat/phone is the only way to ""be"" with them).
I want to know I matter, my birthday is this saturday... and I'm probably going to spend it studying, all on my own *tear :'(...  I just cant keep going like this much longer reddit...
I really just someone to hug, cuddle with, and give all this love I'm able to give, but have no special girl to give it to...I'm tired of being alone for the past 2 years, I've learned that its okay, but I still really prefer having someone... also hugs are welcomed, appreciated, and encouraged.  Friends too?...:) And yes, I'm a sensitive guy, and that's why I like myself.  I'm able to feel compassion and many other feelings a lot of other jerk guys don't, that's good right?... 


**TL;DR:**  I feel really depressed, days go by and life passes me by, dunno what happened to my social skills, almost no friends, not sure why I can't get a girl to like me as more than an acquaintance/friend... college sucks and is draining me to death.

He leveled with me and explained that he would recommend me to someone, but I would almost definitely be put on some type of medication that would effect my personality so I would have to be sure it was something I wanted.

dyuq1,depression,brokenbits,For Your Reading Pleasure: A Little Rant and Ramble,"I need to rant. I need to break. I need, I need. I don't know what, but I need. Here is my chest for you and everything I am shaking off of it like dried out bread crumbs. Here are my broken bits, let me scatter them. Just let me leave them for the birds. I don't know where else to do this. Am I suicidal? No, no. I am merely mad. Incapable of processing the passionate humanity of my life. Hear me scream for attention. SCREAM. Pity me, coddle me. Lick my gaping wounds. What is the matter with this poetic rambling sideshow? What brings her pathetic need for a stranger's love and appreciation to your wandering journey through the various pieces of internet drivel.

I suppose it doesn't really matter what it is, just that it is. I am. If I cut in deep enough I'll find me, I will break the skin open and find the coursing of my blood with dancing turns of helixed information. Release the endorphins. Let them shwoosh. Let the addiction to punishing myself as my gift to the rest of the world swell tangible. A small cut, on my fat, jiggling upper thigh. I will barely find blood there in the thickness of it.

I broke open a kiwi. The fuzzy brown skin in patches. The knife still decorated with the green guts of it. I could use that knife.

But I am power. Power over my madness, appreciation of the dark desires of it. No, I am human - I am powerlessness. This is what fascinates me about the surgical certainty of self-destruction. You cannot destroy me, if I have already destroyed myself! What ho! Your rapier has no effect on me. The glass of your cat o' nine tails cannot cut into the thickened shell of my back, the aura of self-inflicted scars.

Oh you do not want me, but I am still intelligent, still beautiful, still wonderful. Oh you would date me, but this other woman fills your superficial needs for a surrogate mother much better. Thank you, come again, the position has been filled. You wouldn't stare into our eyes and tell us both we are wonderful, no, of course not. I was just beat out by someone better, smarter and more wonderful. Every time.

I've been living in the illusion that I am something. I AM SOMETHING WORTHY. No, I am a bundle of neuroses held together by therapy. I was right in the beginning, I should take what I can get. Each man that throws the words at me, you are just not quite good enough, almost, but not quite. He pulls them through my throat. He unwinds the yarn in my gut that coils into hibernation and speaks through me to myself. Let me throw my mixed metaphors at myself.

Fuck you, fuck me, fuck us all. But mostly, just fuck me, please. Hold me and tell me I'm a neurotic wreck. That I am constructed of broken bits of myself. That the things that I believe about the bubble of my reality are unhelpful constructed lies. That somewhere, someone is waiting to say...I can handle your ugliness, your madness, and I can handle the crazy fire of your beauty. Your deep and broken beauty. I care, I will give you a chance. If you give yourself a chance first.

Oh, what have I done? What is the point of this bloody rambling mess? I have breathed. I will not break myself open again, but rather continue to drag the lame limb of my soul through another day. One day I will touch my fire. One day I will be free of myself and part of myself. But today, I will not cause another tangible scar; I have touched my emotions. Looked into the face of my fear and my self-hatred and seen it's saucy tongue stuck out at me. One day I will reunite the lost brothers of my conscious and unconscious selves; they will hold each other in a familial, intimate brace and know what it is to be human. What is it to be?

No, I am not suicidal. Just another depressive with an interior poorly designed to handle the complexities of being a conscious creature.  Constantly on the verge of implosion, but not suicidal.

But, Oh, today, I will not hurt myself today because of the raging emotions that I cannot grasp or control. I will simply rant rant rant into your eyes.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dyuq1/for_your_reading_pleasure_a_little_rant_and_ramble/,1288477243

Since I've been on anti-depressants I have become more creative (mostly photography) before I started medication I was not that creative at all, I considered myself to be quite analytical and enjoyed mostly technical things. Although I was creative when I was in high school.

I tend not to enjoy technical stuff so much at the moment. Which makes studying difficult to say the least. I'm worried about next year because I start in a graduate position relying on analytical and technical skills.

dz3r4,depression,instant_street,Are antidepressants really worth it?,"I've been depressed for almost 10 years now, and the past 3 years have been a total nightmare. Since my job involves thinking (scientific research), I'm a bit afraid of taking antidepressants, since there might be long term effects on the brain. I wouldn't want to damage my brain with drugs, especially since part of my depression is due to the fact that I'm worried that my alcohol abuse when I was younger (nothing really bad, but still) and that the fact that I took low doses of antipsychotics when I was a teenager might have damaged my brain. So I'm careful now.

Moreover, when you read studies about antidepressants, the difference between the placebos and the antidepressants is so slim that it's crazy. They seem really inefficient.

That, and the added risk of sexual problems. I already have enough sexual problems like that (probably caused by the depression), I don't want things to get worse - I don't have a girlfriend for now, but you never know. Bupropion is the only AD I know off that doesn't cause sexual problems (not a SSRI).

It seems that a lot of people are vague as to whether antidepressants work for them. I'm really not convinced, a lot of people try a shitload of meds, and after a while sometimes say they feel better, but who knows if they wouldn't have felt better without the meds too?

And then, once in a while, I read something from someone who says antidepressants really changed his life, that his depression was just chemical and that after years of suffering he's happy again. When I read something like that, it kinda gives me hope and makes me want to try.

So is it really worth it? I have some bupropion and escitalopram, but I'm afraid of risking to damage my brain even further (yeah I know that theoretically depression also causes brain damage but this isn't the same thing). I wouldn't take escitalopram because of the sexual effects but I'm thinking of trying bupropion.

I don't think I fit the term ""Depressed"" but more ""sad"". I'm sorry for typing all this here but I don't know where else to vent my problems.

I feel lonely, I sit at home getting on with life, with school, but I never get the feeling I have any proper friends. sure I have people I talk to quite a lot, but I never get the feeling I know them properly. They are always out having fun and always seem so happy with their other friends while I do nothing. All I want is a proper friend

But that isn't the main thing that has me down recently, I am afraid to talk to my family. I don't know why but I feel awkward around family members and try to have as little contact with them as possible, I always give short answers to questions they ask, and I am afraid of doing what I want to do in life as my parents would have to talk about it (I am 16 if this helps) I have always wanted to start cooking and invite friends round, but I get embarrassed of what my parents might think. One thing I think that might be stopping me from talking to my parents is the fact they do not know about my sexuality, I am gay. My mother would be accepting but I have the feeling that my dad and brother would have a sense of disappointment.

dz6g8,depression,MyNameIsUnimportant,"Trouble to describe but... I don't feel emotion, and anytime I do remotely think I feel something I can't help but think that it's fake... ","The title pretty much describes it. I'm a 21 year old college student that puts up a nice front towards being okay. I've had problems for years and would say I had depression... always. I remember hating my life as far back as second grade. 

I genuinely can't tell if I really miss feeling. I'm more cynical, bitter and probably overall a less jovial person... but I'm not malicious to others and I think I prefer to be less melodramatic overall. 

However for the past few months it has shifted into less being sad and more to just apathy. I don't care. The main problem I have in this situation is that my libido seems to be shot, and I no longer feel as if I have any romantic or personal connections to anyone.

I don't mean to sound meta but the best way to describe it is as if I once had strings connecting me to things and every single one of them has been either severed or is far less tightly wound.

I no longer enjoy video games as much, I no longer enjoy anything excessively or for any extended period of time. I've lost feelings toward girls for the most part, the one that there is sort of is horribly complicated and nonexistant pretty much. 

I've even been trying to do more recently, exercising, going out more often, spending time with friends but I still can't help but feel like I'm just going through the motions. Even with all of this I just don't understand why I don't feel anything.

I've been so resolute on solving my own problems that I refuse to ask anyone I know for advice or help. This has made me go from being a generally outgoing person to extremely reserved and quiet.
I know now that I need to break this cycle, but it feels like it has been too long. I feel I lost a part of my personality in dealing with this for the past years. And in a weird sense, fighting it makes me feel like more of a failure; as if being this far in a rut is shameful in its own right.

dzbhf,depression,Nowaynotathrowaway,How to cope better?,"Hi everybody. Obviously a throwaway, friends know my main account and I'm not ready to talk to them about it, but I've been a redditor for a while.

The reason I am posting is because I think I am noticing some issues with my mental and emotional health lately. I can't afford to go to a doctor right now, but will be able to soon, which I will probably do regardless of the discussions, but for right now, I'm turning to this subreddit for a little advice. For a little backstory, I am a mid-20's male. When I was 15 I was diagnosed with depression, as well as ADD(which I disagree with having had, but that's neither here nor there), and a few other minor issues which I can't quite remember now but I believe have been resolved anyway. I was prescribed a  drug for a while, it was a roller coaster, it turned out that it was hurting my mental health more than helping it. Mixed in with hormones, a death in the family I took very hard, and other factors, it made life very hard. I had considered suicide, but never very seriously. When I turned 18, I decided to come off the medicine, weened myself off without talking to my doctor, and it actually seemed to work. I took things I learned and coped, I was my normal self again, as the pills changed my whole personality, and I was happy again. I really hated the pills, in case you can't tell. 

Anyway, I went to college, graduated, got a job, all was well. I was laid off a number of years ago, am going back to school, am married, and have an amazing daughter. I am mostly happy, but I am noticing my attitude starting to change, slowly. For one, I find myself getting angry much easier lately than I used to. I have **never** hurt, intentionally or otherwise, my child or my wife, and never will. My biological father abused my mother and myself, and I promised myself to be better than him. I notice certain things though. When I get very frustrated, my mind jumps to suicidal thoughts. I have control over them, I rationalize it, take a few deep breaths, take a walk, whatever coping mechanisms I do, they go away. These are few and far between, and while I don't see them as a threat to me right now, I certainly see them as a cause for concern if they get worse(I assure you, if there was any thought that I didn't think I could control I would get help immediately, my family means too much to me). I would say this happens maybe once a week, not often. I also have found myself losing motivation to do things. I try to keep pushing myself, and I do, but sometimes I find myself just not wanting to do anything, whether it is work on homework, read a book, or play a video game. This is maybe once a week as well, but not related to the first item.

I'm also noticing some of the other feelings that I felt when I was younger and having a tough time, but now find myself having an advantage of rational thought and knowing why I am feeling the way that I am. I guess I'm saying I have it under control for the moment, but would like help in finding out how to keep it from coming up so often. I cannot go to a doctor for a month or two without having to use money I can't afford to use right now, so I would really like to find a way to keep everything in check until I can. I have started to eat healthier and exercise a bit, which I hope will help to, if nothing else, keep my mind occupied. Is there anything else that someone can recommend? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Again, I truly don't see myself as a threat to myself or anyone around me now or in the foreseeable future, which is the reason I posted here instead of /SW. If there is any other information that I can give that may be helpful to understanding more I will be happy to give it, though this is a new account so I'm limited in how fast I can respond.

dzeey,depression,DarkFirezn,Infinity Loop...Feeling pretty helpless,"Depression hurts and is so freaking annoying. It sucks, and I have no idea how to express it. 

Summarizing what has happened thus far:

 I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada and I went to Toronto for university. I'm taking a year off because I practically failed first year. Since then, I've decided to take a year off and try to find a job; which I'm unsuccessful atm. 
 
Depression has been with me ever since Elementary School. During High School, I was extremely suicidal. After attempting to choke myself [dump attempt], I've never been suicidal. I realized the importance of life and wanted to make the most of it. To...(yah, lame), change the world for the better. 

 Lately; that's just not been happening. After 1 year by myself at university; I went back to major depression, feeling lost all over again. Taking a year off didn't help either. 4 months by myself I realize how alone I truly am. 

I can't ask for help anymore. I've asked my friends too many times and I don't know if coming to reddit, EVEN though I know I may just end up wasting people's time. I guess I really just want someone to talk to. It's stupid yah. I've talked to so many people and they've tried to help me. I THINK I know what's wrong with myself but... agh. The loop keeps killing me. 

The Loop as in; An up and down mood... I find something or someone to cheer me up, and then after a while, I fall back down. I've been struggling to deal with it and...it's pathetic. It's obvious that I'm not trying hard enough. 

I can't say that I'm lost... I just don't know where to start. W/out school; it's hard to find jobs randomly. I don't even know where to find volunteer places. There's no clubs to join. At my age, [19], I should be at school. Sucks. 

If anyone can dedicate time, I would appreciate it. But...I don't know what to say... I wish for someone...I guess to pour myself onto but I know I'll come back depressed. Like I said; I've used up all my resources. My friends are sick of me depressed and they can't help me anymore. Anytime I'm depressed; they try to change the subject or ignore me. :\... So any reply would be much appreciated.

Now I have a few problems that have me at the edge and are pushing me over. First and foremost is that I need money to have when I'm there, so I've been working non-stop. In my job you're lucky to get 4 days of work a week. I've worked the past month with one day's break. I'm talking 5-10 hour days, with a second job early sunday mornings. I'm so exhausted that even when I get a full night's sleep I feel absolutely nothing from it. That alone has been enough to wear me down the point where I want to murder someone. Coworkers get antsy because I glare all the time and more than once I've made someone back off just with an angry pose. While at work I have constant fantasies about snapping at everyone who works there. Keep in mind I've never been in a fight and never want to be in a fight. Work just has me wanting to kill myself or someone. Or both.

The girl I love has problems of her own. Legitimate problems. Big ones. Ones that have nothing to do with our relationship but nonetheless cloud it. These problems prevent her from really loving me. I hear all about them and see the effects and sometimes I just want to reach through the phone and wring her neck. And then I feel bad about that. I feel bad that I can get angry at all when she has such actual problems. Family-health-issues grade problems. I feel like the biggest piece of shit on earth because I can think about myself and how I feel at all.

This trip is an all or nothing deal. If it fails.... What has me down even more are two things. First is that every time I mention it, she lowers the possibility of us having sex. I'm a 21 year old virgin who never plays D&amp;D. Unheard of these days. Shameful. And no don't give me that bullshit about how it's okay to be a virgin at that age. Fuck you, you don't truly believe that and neither does anyone else. That alone is cause for a bullet in the brain and you all know it. My other problem is that I feel selfish for wanting sex when she has all these problems on her mind. Again I feel like it's a good reason to die, to rid the world of a bit of selfishness. I want sex but hate myself for wanting it. At least it's not because of religion I suppose.

The worst part of this all is that I'm her rock. Her man. She told me herself that she needs me to be her man or she will start looking for a rock somewhere else. She told me this when I was spilling my feelings about this. She doesn't want me to be emotional around her is all I could take from that. Again it's a case of knowing something and hating myself for not liking it. I know she needs me to be steady around her, to keep he grounded when her own problems threaten her. But I hate that I can't be myself. It's affecting other people. Being tired at work is one thing but it is this that fuels my anger there. I cannot express my feelings to her so they come out elsewhere and they all turn into hatred of everything I see and do.

I don't know what else to do. I have no friends nearby to talk to. I would rather kill myself than talk to parents or doctors. Just over a week until I leave on the trip. Each day I get closer to the trip I feel more anxious that I'm going to mess everything up. I feel worse and worse and worse. Sometimes I just slip into fantasies where I kill myself and everything is all over. Where I can get peace and quiet and not have to fucking work anymore, at a place where sex and drugs are constant conversation topics, or hate myself for loving her too much.

I just don't know what to do. Just don't know what to do.

EDIT - She is out of the house right now for time to think. Left her phone behind. She's been gone almost 2 hours. We generally don't not speak for that long unless class/work (and not even then anymore), or because one of us is very angry. Extremely angry. Livid. I was hoping for comments, discussion. Anything to keep me from realizing there is an actual sword next to my bed I could fall down on.

EDIT 2 - Nevermind she's home again. Now to talk her out of killing herself. Goodbye reddit.",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dzs82/sit_back_and_be_comfortable_this_will_take_a_while/,1288658566
dzt32,depression,K-Bar,I think I know what a big part of my problem is. ,"Family. Or rather, lack thereof. And I'm sorry for lamenting, its just Reddit is just about the only place I can have people show some signs of caring.

Until I was 19, it was just my mother and I. I didn't have the greatest relationship with my dad, and we've always been distant, emotionally and location. In 2008, my mother passed away, and since then I've had this huge hole that can't be filled. 

I have friends who's parents are super nice to me, and make me feel more than welcome in the house. But I only see them every so often, and I can't expect them to take me in, or to treat me as they would their own kid. That much is obvious.

I live with a friend who I've known for years, and she's older, has her own family, etc. But, since I graduated and moved in with them, its been feeling less and less like a home to me. They berate me on practically everything, and although they know I'm depressed, its almost as if they're making it seem my fault, and that my depression is tearing the family apart (which isn't true). Pretty much, until I get a crap job, I'm nothing to them. They don't see me as an adult (I guess I don't really expect them to), are nice to me, but compared to how shitty they make me feel about myself on a daily basis, doesn't really do anything, or I can't even believe them when they do say something nice. My friends parents are more supportive of my budding film career than they are. And even though film is my passion and what I want to do with my life, it doesn't matter to them...I don't think at least. They don't act like it. For me to be seen as something, I have to work at a grocery store first. 

They're doing a lot taking me in, but I really miss parental love. Maybe its because its the only love I've had. I don't get much validation, and I'm not the type of person who can give it to myself. It would just be nice to hear 'I'm really proud of you' or 'I love you' once in a while. I just miss having someone who always has your back, without making you feel worthless for doing so. To get a hug or just that 'home' feeling. 

I've lost what was closest to me, and not having it is only making me worse. My depression has only grown more dire, since I moved in. I don't have a job, so I can't move out or anything. Its not like I don't want one, but times are hard (but they're way older, and have high paying jobs as it is. I don't think they really get how hard it is to find a job when you're freshly out of school). 

My crew and I shot the first Zombie convention this weekend, and got great stuff of Bruce Campbell, George Romero, Chuck Palaniuk...met lots of great producers and all around, looked great. This one weekend gave me great prospect and opportunity. I felt happy for once. When I came back today, it was like I did something wrong, and nobody barely talked to me. Nobody cared. I know I should be proud of myself, but it would be nice to have the closest person to you, actually care a little about something like that. It meant a lot to me, and now my good feeling is long gone. 

My mom was my biggest--and only fan. Now that she's gone, I feel as if I have nothing. I just miss having someone care and happy for what I've done, no matter how small it may be. ",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dzt32/i_think_i_know_what_a_big_part_of_my_problem_is/,1288662327
dztga,depression,Advise-this-dude,"Hey /r/depression please take a look, I need some help. ","Ok. WOW, where to begin. First off this is a throwaway account. I have been dealing with depression for about a decade now and today I finally decided this has to stop.  Let's see. When I was around 12 or 13 I began seeing a doctor because I would rage and fight my parents and basicly just get REALLY pissed off. I saw a psychologist for about 6 months. I was taking a bunch of Meds, I don't know what they where and after that six months I stoped seeing the doc and ditched the pills. To be honest I was so out of the loop that I don't know what the doctor decided about me and I don't know what I was taking. For a while I thought it was just puberty, the rage stopped, I quit the meds and now here I am a decade later, 23 y/o.  I don't know where to begin, somthing is fucked up and reddit was the best place to look for help. Let's see.....I have no sex drive (I'm male). I have hardly any appetite, even though I'm 6 foot and weigh 130 pounds. When I have a day off (im a workaholic) I stay in bed all day. I've become a serious introvert.  I've lost passion for most of my previous hobbies. I don't consider myself an alcholic, when it comes time to buy alcohol or go to a bar, I don't have the balls and just go home. I do drink occasionaly, butt mostly it's when I really need some self confidence or when I'm feeling down about myselfy but it will be days or weeks before I drink again. I love to smoke weed but hate drug dealers so my drug habbits are weeks between or whenever I randomly come accross sombody who can toss me a sack. In the last few dayS I realized that this condiion has become out of control. I am a diehard snowboarder, every second of everyday, well my local muntain just opened, all my friends are there. I thought it would be so fun to go but I want nothing to do with it. Today I dailed In an appoitment with my local doc. It will be about 2 weeks before I can see him but though I should post here first. So reddit, any advice on what I should do next? Please I'm 23 wasting away the best years of my life and have no idea what to do......oh btw I don't have suicidal thoughts because I see so many people who are SOOOO happy, that I would rather live to try and see what that is like than die.

dzxv6,depression,MotrinPA,"First time, sorry if it's kind of long.","To start things off, I'm now 24, about to turn 25.

My parents never married, and were never even a couple.  They were just partners and friends, they both were heavy into drugs and the distribution and production of certain drugs.  When I was almost 3 or 4 shit hit the fan and the cops raided the Motel that my Mom and I were staying in.  I was sent to a foster home for 3 days and then my Grandparents picked me up.  Turned out both my parents had been arrested and it was going to be awhile until they were out again.  

  I was raised by my Grandparents my whole life, I called them Mom and Dad since I was 5.  I was a good kid, bad teenager.  Good grades and bad choices, after I graduated High School I made a lot of bad choices and got heavily addicted to the same drug that sent both of my parents to Prison for so long.  During this spurt of challenging myself to see how long I could stay awake, my Grandmother got very sick on a random morning.  
  I had not slept in that night and waited for the morning to come to hang out with my grandma before she went to work in the morning.  Everything was fine, she went to work like normal.  Less than an hour later she came back home cringing in pain and rushed herself into bed.  My Grandpa (who was at the beginning stages of dementia) wanted to drive her to the hospital and have me wait there for my Aunt to arrive.  My Grandpa ended up dropping my Grandma off at a hospital miles away and got lost and couldn't find his way back.  I was to high to grasp the situation at hand and ran away to a friends house for a few days.  One day I went and visited my Grandma in the hospital.  The image still haunts me, she was higher then I was.  She was on loads and loads of morphine and was claiming the nurse was trying to kill her by not changing the TV.  
  This was the woman I looked up to and admired more than anyone in the world and she was dying, so I ran away to a friends out of the state.  During my run she passed away.  I came back a week later to my house real late at night and the house was empty.  Everything I had grown up with and been raised with and around was gone.  Apparently my family sold it all in a yard sale to pay for a home for my Grandfather.  

  After all this my Aunt Kelli and my Mom were the only family members who kept contact with me after the passing.  My aunt tried to keep my apart of everything, but 8 months after my Grandmother (my Aunt's Mom) passed away, she gave into breast cancer that she had been fighting for 2 years.  When this happened, all I had was my Mom who I never saw, and was not very close with at all.  I thought of her more as a sister.  Only problem was that my Mom was just as poor as I was at 18 and just as unemployed.  No one in my family wanted anything to do with me, and not one of them ever offered me a helping hand or a place to stay. 
  Needless to say I became homeless and started squatting around local areas and friends houses for a couple years.  I lived with a friend for awhile and they had enough of me being there freeloading and gave me a month to find somewhere else to stay.  I called my Mom asking her for some sort of advice, she told me my father had been out of jail for awhile and would love to meet me.  So I took the jump and called my Dad who I had not spoken with in almost 20 years.  
  By this time I was 9 almost 20 and my Dad said he would love for me to go on the road with him while he works and he'd give me a place to stay with him in Oregon.  So I packed my bags (which was just a backpack) and took the leap to go with my Dad.  
  My Dad and I clicked pretty well but I just could not stay there with him I had to go back to California to make it on my own.  SO I went back home and lived out of the Jeep my Dad had given me until I could find a place to stay.


I still struggle with deep issues of self-doubt, lack of confidence, confusion, loneliness, and just all around feeling lost.  I have sabotaged almost every move in the right direction I've had and have been attaching myself in long-term relationships with the first girl that shows interest and am to scared to ever try and leave purely out of loneliness.

e0edr,depression,[deleted],Is alcoholism a mental disorder or is there just mental disorders where alcohol fills the void?,"I am curious because my father was an alcoholic and he was a great man - it's just that he could not give it up, which caused his passing. My brother is a long time recovering alcoholic and had a little relapse this past year but is doing pretty good now. I have had long talks with him and we have a lot of the same ways of living and functioning in our lives.

I myself have been hospitalized in a mental hospital and have been on different meds, seen various therapists.

I've never drank alcohol because I know almost for a fact that it would lead me down the same road my dad never turned off of and my brother did decide to turn off of.

I've been diagnosed with depression/bipolar disorder/anxiety this or that disorder - the doctors aren't quite sure.

My question is that is alcoholism an actual disorder or are there just mental disorders where alcohol and other substances for that matter, fill the void that is so constant with manic depression, depression, etc.

Too bad I need a prescription for this stuff.

A few years ago I fount his international address online. I sent a letter to him and got a letter back. I sent another letter but didnt hear anything back. I did it again this summer but got nothing back. 

I thought about him this weekend so I did another online search for him. This time something came up unexpectedly. A picture of him. I have pics of him from a long time a go but this is the most current pic I've ever seen.

The general population would probably blow off a dead beat dad and probably say something to the effect ""Yea looks like a dead beat dad"" when you see the pic. But the opposite happened.

e0hqt,depression,completenoob,"I'm usually one to peruse through reddit, but I feel the need to post this. I hope at least one of you reads this.","This is a throwaway account, though it wouldn't matter because I think only one of my friends has seen the account name of my other one. I'm also a complete noob, so I don't know how to properly format this. Anyways, here I go with my dung-heap of a story and rant, asking at the end whether you think I am suffering from depression, and most importantly, inform me of what solutions I should pursue rather than what the treatments are (because I know the basics, counseling, therapy, medication). So here it is.

I'm 17, going through my senior year of high school, but it is more accurately described as the year going through me, with my only acts being the shifting of my body to different classrooms at the end of each period, and driving the monotonous route I take to and from school everyday. My family life isn't very healthy. I'm sure there is lots of love, but my father left my mother when I was in middle school, about 5 years ago, and my mother has been trying to cope ever since. I know that she started smoking again for a brief period till I caught the smell of it in her breath, and now she has switched to the nicotine gum. She also takes antidepressants and sees a therapist which is something she rarely talks about.

My year older cousin also died recently, and he was not someone I talked to every day, and not even every week, (he lived a whole 6 hour drive away from me) but I loved him a lot, and I saw him as an older brother, and he was a lot like me but with a more accepted and appreciated sense of humor, a dime of a girlfriend, and a bigger appetite for adrenaline.

Although these realities make me very sad, they don't make me depressed, but after I had risen from the shock of my parents' divorce, and as I struggle to compose myself after learning of my cousin's death, I reverted back to a mentality I have often held. A ""What-the-fuck?!"" is wrong with me view that makes me think of myself a loser, someone who actually has had many advantages in life who still never feels happy.

Ok maybe I should get on track with my own behaviors and thoughts. I don't do exceptionally well with people. I do have friends, and it isn't like I feel that I am exceptionally bad looking or unable to get friends, I just either don't feel motivated at all to talk to anyone, or I feel extremely under-confident. I always feel that with my own friends I am just there, and I never occupy the interests of others on any deep or meaningful level. I do well at school, which any person with half a brain could do, but barely anyone has to will and dull nerve to accomplish. I used to be horrific at school back when I felt constantly suicidal, during my sophomore and the beginning of my junior year, (which I spent mixing diet pills with vodka), but now, although more subdued and calm, I feel the depression again. College apps still scare the shit out of me though. I do ok at school but I am always paranoid about ending up unsuccessful, which leads me to be fearful and procrastinate while being nervous, which is less fun than either being completely absent from my studies or devoting myself to them entirely. I feel like I haven't done what I am capable of, because I am smart and lazy. I fucked myself over academically and socially I don't have much to show for. I cry when I think of disabled people dealing with struggles because I think, ""if only they could've had what I did, and if only I wasn't here at all.""

I feel like I either make too much of an effort to appear interesting, or I completely shut off altogether in order to avoid the first. My relationships with guys others have consisted of being good friends with people who wouldn't actually talk to me if they had more fun, however trivial, things to do. My relationships with girls have consisted of failed attempts at relationships with the women I love. One girl rejected me for being atheist, saying that a guy she was with had to christian, to which I discovered she, a 15 year old, was dating a pedophile 19-year old who put pics of her tits on the web, and I also found out that she gave a blowjob to a jewish douchebag (the terms are unrelated) at a concert.

My other relationships with girls include casual sex, which in and of itself, isn't really that bad. It is hard to think of offing myself while having my penis in the mouth or vagina of a girl, but I usually end up feeling worthless after ejaculating, questioning whether I was the kind of man who actually wanted what I had done.

So anyways, I don't really think I'm that interesting, and there I go anyway typing this much :/ thanks to anyone who reads this.",18,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e0hqt/im_usually_one_to_peruse_through_reddit_but_i/,1288766052

Now this could be pure coincidence or, has my diet (or lack of it) improved my mood.  Now i know this may be a loose connection, but thyroid can affect appetite and metabolism. 

So my loose theory is, is my depression caused by my thyroid, possible evidence being not eating has caused my symptoms to lessen.

e0yk7,depression,whoneedsfriends,Friends are no longer there... Can't find a reason to stay,"So, I've had issues with friendships ever since I was a kid.  My best friend growing up abused my friendship, and basically only wanted me around when it was convenient for him... which I did not realize until my college years.  Middle and High school I spent being made fun of and being called gay.  College was better, but towards the end, much of the same... Accusations of homosexuality were much more frequent and more widespread.  The girlfriends that I had were ALWAYS (I kid you not) stolen away from me by people I considered to be my best friends.

I finally thought things were getting better my senior year of college.  I was introduced to a new group of friends that lived by my hometown, and we all hung out a lot and became a lot closer.  After graduating college and realizing the people I was ""friends"" with there were immature and were not going to change, I looked forward to my new life with my new friends.

I ended up getting an apartment with two of the guys I considered to be my closest friends.  It's been several months now though, and both of them seem to be more distant, and one flat out doesn't like me.  I started going to see a psychologist a few weeks ago, but it seems to be a huge waste of money.  I tell him what is going on in my life, and only seems to tell me what I already know.

Recently, things took a turn for the worst... my one roommate is very pissed at me for something that isn't that big of a deal (IMO), and now he will not talk to me, hang out with me, or even be civil with me.  Tonight, when the other roommate came home, they both made plans to go out and went out of their way to not include me.  When I asked what they were up to, they ignored me.  When I asked to join, the put me off.

Most people wonder why I put up with people who treat me badly, but the truth is I have no one else.  I don't have any friends besides this group, and i'm the type of person that relies on a best friend heavily.  I'm just starting to realize that I don't have one.

I've always tried to be the best person I can be, and to be caring, but it seems to keep getting me no where.  I do nice things for the guys and try to help them out, even financially, and I feel like I get nothing in return.  Therapy isn't helping, and I'm starting to get physically sick when they do things like they did tonight.

""Are you happy?"" I always have to sit and think about how to answer that question. 'No, I'm not happy, but what is happiness, what makes me happy?'

I don't know what is wrong with me.. I have no connections in this life because it seems no matter what, people don't want to be around the real me. It used to be okay, back when I would lie to them and myself and put on a happy face and make jokes and all that but if I ever broke character they would leave me. Living a lie..

I tried leaving my home once before, didn't tell any of them and got on a bus at midnight to another state.. I couldn't take the stress family and friends put on me. Maybe I'm destined to roam alone. Now, I've moved several states away.. But it isn't any better. I have a roommate. Which is good, I think I have trouble trying to turn down my life so they can turn theirs up. I want to be me without any interruptions but that never works out

I feel like everyone around me is a zombie.. How can they go through life with all of these fake emotions and feelings? Or so they seem to be. Death doesn't scare me.. Death of a loved one doesn't sadden me.. Loss of money doesn't make me cry.. Maybe I'm the zombie. In a world filled with 'colorful' people that get by day to day paying more attention to the news than what's happening in their own house.

No matter how hard I try to tell them I just want to go, drop off, they try and hold on to me and I think that's the worst part.. I can't cope with making their lives work out too by being someone I'm not, just let me be alone.. I just want to roam. Building lasting relationships with humans doesn't work for me because they feel so alien. I'm alien..

The last time I was at a funeral was 10 years ago when I was 10 and my great great grandma and grandpa died. I was crying.. But I didn't know why. I was crying because everyone else was crying.. The first funeral was for GGPa and I cried then, but for GGMa I didn't cry. It didn't make sense to cry!

What the fuck is death anyways? Why worry about it if you don't even know what happens? Are you worried about losing the things you have invested in this material world? Worried about losing the investments in the people you've known? If they die, that makes you sad. You don't know where another person goes when they die. Why is it sad? It could be good. Or it could be nothing. Or it could be rebirth into something else. Or maybe their world explodes and it's game over for gramps

I haven't cut myself or done much bodily harm (that it would seem like) but I used to think of suicide every fucking day. It was relaxing and peaceful to just imagine the different ways I could go out in a day. I don't worry about it anymore. Now I just think of how I could get away, because that would be better for the people around me than if I just keeled over.

I don't know. Life gets to me sometimes. Nothing makes sense.. I can't prove to myself that any of this is real, so I have difficulty with that too.

I saw a psychologist (or the other one, I forget the name/difference) for a couple weeks, back in the day when I was young and my parents thought I had issues. Well whenever I talked to that fool and told him my thoughts, he didn't really fix any of it. What are they going to do? I don't think I can be helped haha

e1j3v,depression,bottomlesspit,Can't get out...,"So much to let out but too ashamed as well.

I never knew how depression could feel nor how crippling it could be.
Since the beginning of this year I:

-GF was cheating on me and broke up with me. This isn't too much of a biggie, just real detrimental to my self-esteem. My first real relationship where I learned a lot  about being in one  but more importantly, myself. I feel so stupid for doing some of the things I did and ,in retrospect, angry at how oblivious and naive I  was. 

-Quit my job: I didn't even show up or put in my 2 weeks notice. I was a  retail salesman( computers) and I did something so shameful the day before  anxiety and shame overwhelmed me so I just quit. This was a blow to my character because prior to working in that department I was in customer service where I busted  my  ass off to get that promotion. Only to find out I wasn't as good as I hoped to be once I got that promotion. The only thing I thought I had ( charisma/silver tongue) wasn't good enough. How do I cope with that? I know it was just a job and not a career, but if I can't excel at something that should be a cakewalk with charisma, who thefuck am I? 

School: I lost my full-tuition scholarship because I'm a fucking idiot. I didn't show up to my classes and was given the chance to save it but due to crippling anxiety , I stayed up late and slept through the final that could of saved me. Excuses excuses. 

Where am I now? I've been a fucking recluse since  July. I used to lift weights five  days a week. Ever since July I havent set  foot in the gym at all. I didnt sign up for classes this year because of anxiety and I knew I would have an extremely difficult time focusing with depression. I've put on 15lbs (gained fat, lost muscle mass) , I used to weigh 180lbs at 5'9 w/ muscle and ~9-11% body fat. During my really depressive state , all I did was eat fast food, processed food, and what not for a month straight. Before, I ate extremely clean, you know.. lean meat, vegetables, low carbs , etc. I'm too afraid to talk to my friends( havent talked to them since I quit my job) due to anxiety and my poor-self image. All I do now is  sit at home and decay. 

I feel hopeless , too stupid to do anything successful since attempts before would always end up in failure,no interest in anything anymore,  disgusted/ashamed of how I look now, and generally.. just existing not living.

e1ksg,depression,Noogie54,Stuck in a funk.,"You guys ever feel a bout of depression coming on? But you know where its headed and you feel powerless to stop it? Well that happened to me recently.

So I work in the oil patch of Alberta, and am on the road rather frequently. I'm on pace to be out of town 9 months this year for work, and i feel like its finally starting to catch up with me.

I love my job, what I do and the pay I make. But I'm starting to loathe the fact that I am constantly away from my friends, I have no SO, or the time/ability to pursue one, and the fact that the ""on the road"" life style is starting to have a negative impact on my physical health (my weight issues). Not to mention it seems that when ever I am on time off, I'm always chomping at the bit to get back on the road for work.

Now all these little things started to weigh on me, and I could start to feel that a bought of depression was coming on. A few days later and its still full on. And it makes me feel like shit, I get back from work and I just want to curl up in bed and go to sleep to make the days blend in together. More sleep means less time to feel sad, and so hopeless.

Fuck. There is so much I want to say, but I dont have the time or motivation to organize my thoughts in to a coherrant post.

Let me clarrify, when I say I feel hopeless I mean that I feel hopeless to make the changes that I need to make that will lead me to feeling better and being healthier. I find it hard to see the positive in the world around me, and I feel shittier because my insecurities are intensified by my depression. But the THING is, I know its not me feeling that way, its the depression making feel that way. I know how I feel is only an illusion, and I keep telling myself that which actually help a bit in feeling better.

I keep telling myself that small changes will have bigger effects. I just need to find the motivation to keep with it.",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e1ksg/stuck_in_a_funk/,1288937128
e1n86,depression,girl632,i'm a disappointment.,"I just need to talk to someone I don’t know. I can’t talk to anyone I know because the conversation will inevitably lead to exams (mine begin tomorrow) and I really, really don’t want to go there. 

There's nothing wrong with my life. I have never had any cause to be depressed. I've never lost anyone close to me. I have family and friends who love me. But I've fucked up, and fucking up despite all that just makes me feel even more like shit.

I’m going to fail my units. Maybe not all, but probably half of them. I don’t know how this will affect my student visa requirements because frankly I’m too terrified to look into it right now (I am an international student in Aus). I’ve always been a procrastinator, but always managed to get my work done, even if at the last minute. I did fairly well in my last few years of high school and in my first semester of uni, but things just started spiraling out of control in the second semester (latter half of 09). I barely passed my units then, and although I got a little better during this year’s first sem, I screwed up again in the second (now) and it’s worse than ever. I’ve been mostly housebound for the past two months (in addition to skipping classes) and only leave my place when my brother drags me to church. I haven’t been eating regularly and sometimes not at all; it’s like I’m putting everything (cooking, laundry, etc) on hold until I get my shit together but I’m nowhere near that so I’m just stuck in some kind of limbo. 
 
I’m feeling mostly numb these past few weeks because I don’t allow myself to think about the hole I’ve dug for myself, because when I do I get panic attacks and cope by NOT thinking about it and…you get the picture. I miss my parents like hell; I’ve been avoiding their calls (they are not in Aus) because I don’t want to let on what a screw-up I’ve been. I haven’t been talking to my friends either because I’m ashamed about the predicament I’m in (we’re chinese, there’s a pressure to excel and a sense of competitiveness among us) and also I have my head buried in the sand, loser that I am. 

My dad has never been the overbearing straight-A’s-only type; he’s tolerant when I don’t do well and he’s proud and happy when I do, so I KNOW intellectually he’ll probably forgive me but that doesn’t make me feel better. I feel myself shrink when I recall the times he’s spoken of me proudly because I keep thinking about when I’ll disappoint him (now) and it makes me want to cry. I think about the good money he’s spent to send me here. When I almost failed last year, he was very understanding and I promised to make up for it this year, and here I am, failing. 

I don’t know what I’m writing here. I don’t know if I’m trying to convince myself how bad I DON’T have it. I don’t know if I’ve managed to. I don’t know what I’m looking for. Advice? Reassurance? Hugs? Censure? Nothing? I’m afraid my parents will give up on me and make me come home. I’m afraid I won’t know how to deal with the shame and the guilt if that happens. I’m afraid I won’t know how to be anything other than a student, and I’m not even a good one now. 

I’ll probably look back on this one day and think myself silly for making this out so seriously, and for even getting into this kind of trouble in the first place. I guess I’m just in that initial kick phase when you fall/jump off something and get the falling sensation that makes your heart leap to your throat -- before the free fall, before the bottom you know you’ll hit eventually (which is a comfort in itself, but not one right now). 


Just to clarify: my academic problems are of my own doing. My procrastination problem became chronic, and because I have a tendency to ignore unpleasant things, I let things snowball to the point where it became near-impossible for me to try to appreciate the enormity of it without being overwhelmed (paralyzed) into inaction. And without appreciating the enormity of it, I didn’t have the impetus to do something, anything. Again, my own fault. I’m really disgusted with myself right now.

e1okj,depression,ranautricularia,"Five thoughts I couldn't shake when I was depressed, and what I wish someone had told me. [xpost in /r/SW]","To my friends in /r/depression and /r/SW:

I wrote a list of thoughts that used to torment me when I was in my lowest of lows, and what I wish I could tell my past self. I don't know if it helps anyone, but I'd like to put it out there just in case.

**1. What I'm going through is nothing; people have gone through the Holocaust and I'm struggling with work/school/etc.**

You're going through your own personal hell and other people have no idea to what extent you're suffering. You are fighting demons that others can only begin to imagine and it's absolutely something that is going to tax your energies, make you tired, drag you down. Looking back on this time in your life, you will be amazed at the strength you had.

People have different skills. You never see a triathlon athlete who is also a world-class chess player and a rockstar. People all have their strengths. As someone who is going through a hard time, your efforts are devoted to taking care of yourself, putting on a brave face, and making it through the day; the fact that you're still here, reading this, means that you're doing well at it. Your strength right now is surviving, and it's no less a struggle than the athlete's or rockstar's, or even someone who survived a war.

Do you think Holocaust victims or Poles in WWII planned to be heroes and survivors? No, but they found the strength to make it through, day by day. You have clearly found that strength, and you must keep making it through, day by day by day.


**2. I'm blowing everything out of proportion.**

You are absolutely not blowing things out of proportion. You are going through a very, very difficult time in your life. Back to the athlete/chess player/rockstar example, some people make their living with their heads, some with their bodies, and all those are valid. Mental struggles are just as important and valid as physical struggles. 

You are going through mental hell. If you were going through physical hell, your wounds would be more visible, you'd probably get more sympathy, people wouldn't be as quick to judge.. and yet you're going through a mental struggle now, which is just as much of a struggle and just as difficult to bear.

Some of you are going through both mental and physical struggles, and others too (spiritual, etc). You have it so tough but think of how brave you are that you've made it so far, alive.


**3. I'm the worst piece of shit who has ever lived. I should just do the world a favor and take myself out of the world.**

Do you blame a person with a cleft lip for their disability? Should you deny the handicapped disability access to buildings? No, because we recognize that some people have problems which are beyond their control and which we shouldn't fault or blame them for.

You have something which is affecting the way you function and the way you view the world, as you know by the sheer fact that you're here, and your priorities now shouldn't be on comparing yourself to other people, or overanalyzing how you treat them, but on getting through. People are very forgiving. I'm sure you forgive people all the time for things that are outside their control. So why are you so hard on yourself? There are things happening in your head which are outside your control and trust me, friends, family, even acquaintances and strangers can be more forgiving and understanding than we often give them credit for.

Besides, when you do end up making it through, you are going to be so much of a stronger person for having had survived this.


**4. Everyone else is doing so well; look how happy they are.**

Everyone is fighting their own battles, to greater or lesser extents. Often we don't even know until someone really lets us inside, but the most well-adjusted people I've met have sometimes confessed to me stories of depression, desperation, abuse, and despair. 

Which does *not* mean that they all understand what you're going through. You're not just depressed, you can't just get over it with some chocolate and a movie. But many of them at least understand what it's like to feel so low you think you'll never get out, and many are putting on a brave face just the same way you are.

An estimated 10% of Americans have some kind of diagnosable mental illness. Often it's hard to find other people who feel like you do, but support groups and even online groups like this one can really help to make you feel like you're not the only person suffering in a world of cheerful, happy people who are ""somehow"" doing better.



**5. It'll never get better.**

It can. I promise. You're going to have to trust me.

I made it through with the help of friends, family, therapy, and meds. It was never easy but I'm here now, graduating from a good school and doing okay on most days. The most important thing is, I'm still here. There were times when the only thing keeping me going was luck, and if that's all you got, then cultivate it.

Sit at the green and hope to meet someone. But instead I just go to my car and this anxiety doesn't end until I get home and lock myself in my room. Then there is work.

e23ru,depression,alittleunhitched,"Should I be feeling down about these problems, or should I ask to talk to a doctor for meds?","I'm in my last year at college.  This year I've been working usually 13 hours a day at college doing course, managing an 8 month project and putting a leg in to help my teemmates complete their areas of the project, we were like friends.  

We had the conclusion presentation last week, and since it they've completely lost interest in being around me at all... when I was working on something at college after class, they told me to leave, so they could feel comfortable talking in their own language.  Whenever I try to talk about something with them they seem to make it a negative thing about me, or give a very blunt, uninterested answer.  I guess I mistook them for friends.

My Grandma died a few days before our presentation, but I needed to manage the team so I supressed that. Now the project's complete, but the client doesn't like the system we've worked with them to develop... I've convinced college that the project was a success, I got the client to sign the acceptance form, but they're not responding to my emails anymore.  College is getting really hard.  

I organized our project presentations this year, which was a large event and involved a whole lot of extra effort, meeting experts to invite them to the presentations, booking the rooms, making programmes, invitation letters, etc. without any help... everyone was tired, but I was working on the largest of the projects, it hurt when nobody else helped when I asked for help.

Grandma used to be someone I went to for emotional support and comfort.  I still really want to go and see her, even after seeing her in the open-coffin funeral, and getting the cards etc. I feel like I need to get her back, but I know I can't.

My 21st birthday came a couple of months ago.  It consisted of my parents putting $250 into my bank account, and a couple of birthday cards... I had been looking forward to it as a sure pick-me-up, but it just made me feel empty, and reflecting on my life, not all that well-off.

I used to have two other sort-of friends, but they're in another project team and often try to ""1-up"" me.  One of them noticed the negative responses coming from my old ""buddies"" on the project, and laughed about it in class, saying it was my project management skills. I could really do with someone to talk to right now, but my old friends genuinely seem to be against me.

I guess I've begun to realise that I'm 21, have spent the last year working on a semi-pointless project that isn't wanted, I've mistakely thought my teammates were friends, and my support person died a few weeks ago. I feel mentally tired, but I'm getting job offers coming in now, for interviews in a week, to start work soon afterwards.

Over the last few days I've been waking up feeling like I really need to hug someone, scared and like crying but I can't. Most of the time I feel lonely.  

I guess I've reached where I wanted to be when I was young, top of the class, with job opportunities when I leave college, but things feel like they're falling apart, and I've been looking for other career paths because I don't find the industry I've spent four years working towards has anything I'd want to do when I leave.  

I've talked to the college psychiatrists (two of them) who say how its tough coping with all this stress, lots going on, try exercise and positive reinforcement, but I'm over trying to fix things when they just keep breaking.

Today I helped a day-long volunteer event, even though I had too much college work to do already. I left feeling like I had been embarrased, and have an urge to sh again.

I can't wait six weeks for something to begin to show an impact. I don't know what to do.  I could really do with someone to talk to, but my course is so competitive that wouldn't work. Should I keep trying to work through this, or would asking for faster acting meds be a better opportunity?

e28kh,depression,INukeAll,I need to find myself but I cant,"I am in the middle of my first year of college and it’s been a rough transition. I knew it was going to be hard before hand but I figured that since my girlfriend was going to the same school she would be able to help me through it, but then 2 weeks before school started she broke up with me. Because I was down about that it was hard to make friends, and now because I have no friends I'm down because of that (I'm pretty introverted so its hard for me to put myself out there unless someone introduces me to people) and recently I was talking to my ex how I wanted to get out and leave all this behind she thought I was talking about suicide, when I was really just talking about leaving, running away basically. She called it into the police and I spent a night at the hospital when I felt like I didn’t need to. So since then I've found that I'm empty and don’t know who I am anymore, but I can’t find myself while I'm here, but I cant leave. I just want a vacation by myself somewhere far off for an extended time that I've never been to.

e2adv,depression,KevMike,"Hey, depressit, how do you reveal you have depression to new relationships?","I want to know how you guys and gals deal with depression and significant others. A year ago I was already in a relationship as I fell into my worst bout of depression, yet.  After a couple of family and friend get-togethers I had a huge break down in front of her.  A week later I broke up with her.  I didn't like the idea of her seeing this side of me. So, preemptively, I split.  Looking back, it was a huge mistake. I made a terrible decision when I was really hurt and I really hurt her because of it.

Fast-forward a year later.  I've started talking to a therapist(who I've subsequently quit. Looking for another, I guess.), trying to get my life back together, trying to make school and a job work. And, as these things seems to happen on their own, I met a girl.  So, not wanting to make the same mistakes twice, I've been thinking about what it means to have depression in a relationship(or the potential, at least). Before we both get too involved. Part of me doesn't feel ready for a relationship.  Another part of me feels like I'll never be ready. Then, a whole other part thinks I should give it a try; go with discretion.  So, here I am: More aware of how I can be, but also wary because of it. I know depression isn't the sexiest of illnesses, so I don't want to come out too soon with it.  But then, I also don't want to be like, ""Surprise! I'm a head case!"", after we've both invested time into each other.  I'm not lying to her about myself. I've just met her on an up-swing, but I'm deathly afraid of what to do when I have my inevitable down-swing.

tl;dr:  How do you guys deal with a depressed loved one, or having depression in a relationship? How did they take it when they found out?

e2and,depression,Soupstorm,Pity rant (continued in my comments).,"I hate who I am and where I am in my life. I just turned twenty-three and didn't feel a thing. I can't keep anything straight in my head long enough to facilitate both my life story and the grammar that goes along with explaining it in story form, so I've decided to just list things that happened to me in chronological order.

For reference, most things are framed around the school year, my birthday is November 2nd, and I am the eldest child.

**Age 3**

- Spent most of my daycare time off in a corner looking at my hands, or generally behaving autistically.

**Age 4**

- Fell off a low balcony and landed directly, 180 degrees on my head; I went to the hospital for concussion and I don't remember anything from my stay beyond flashes of plastic curtains and confusion.

- Failed to make friends or feel included in kindergarten.

**Age 6 / Grade 1**

- Got locked in my school's pool changing room after the after-school swimming lessons, presumably because everyone forgot I was there. My mom had to somehow get the attention of the janitor so that I could be let out.

- Moved from Toronto to London, and completely failed to make new friends. Felt looming emptiness over the move and the loss of what little social fabric I had.

**Grade 2**

- Still no friends. I spend all my time watching TV, playing Lego, and reading books like The Hobbit or geo-evolutionary world history.

- It becomes deeply apparent to my dad that I'm not going to be carrying on his legacy of sports success and social butterflyism. He stops caring and diverts his attention to my two younger brothers and youngest sister.

**Grade 3**

- Watched my favourite cat (of two) get run over by a Ferrari that never stopped, the day before Easter (Note: I'm not religious). I cried for a week.

**Grade 4**

- Finally come across my first friend. We'd play The Incredible Machine and Mario Kart sometimes. I still don't ""feel"" much when I'm with him.

- During our school's monthly pizza lunch, my name is accidentally skipped over. I immediately explode in anger - I packed up all my things, grabbed my coat (it was the middle of January) and walked home to flip out in private and cry with my remaining cat.

**Grade 5**

- My first legitimate public breakdown; I had to do some stupid one-minute presentation in front of the class, and I ended up running out of the room crying. I went home that day.

**Grade 6**

- My school performance begins to slip. I almost fail Math on my first report card, despite being far-and-away the smartest kid in my class.

- I become the second-smartest kid in the class when a new kid shows up and becomes my new best friend. He and another common friend of ours go biking all the time and play videogames and micro machines and whatnot.

- I get an N64 for Christmas and begin my spiral into videogame obsession. I also get my first tastes of Starcraft, Doom, Quake, Half-Life, and Counter-Strike during this year, making one other friend in the process.

**Grade 7**

- Sex ed; we're shown an overhead of the vagina, which I have never seen or even though much of before, and I pop an insta-boner. This is the only thing that assures me I'm not gay (not that I have a problem with other people being gay).

- The less-hyperintelligent of my two friends moves away. I never get to speak to him again.

- My best-friend and I sort of drift along without really developing as people. Our friendship remains cold and comfortable.

**Grade 8**

- Best friend and I kind of drift apart and stop hanging out for no good reason. We haven't talked at all since.

- I make several more-outgoing friends who play a lot of videogames. I always feel like I'm tagging along and not entirely accepted into the group, though.

- I join the youth group of one of my friends, in an effort to ""put myself out there"" socially. I latch onto disparate religious ideas and hang onto them as if they're the reason why I have any social success at all.

**Grade 9**

- I completely fail to make new friends.

- 9/11 happens. I stop going to the youth group and declare myself an atheist.

- I almost fail English with a 51.

**Grade 10**

- I begin drifting away from my elementary school friends.

- I join the Tech Crew and make a few somewhat-strenuous friends.

- I almost fail English again. I just can't care about it.

**Grade 11**

- Drift away from my elementary school friends. Except for one of them, we never really talk again.

- Make a few new friends in grades 9 and 10 out of Tech Crew roster additions.

**Grade 12**

- Fucked up my final year of highschool. I almost failed English, Physics, Calc, and Discrete Mathematics, didn't do any homework, didn't get into University. I went back for a fifth year.

- Over the summer I get my first job at a grocery store.

**Grade 13 / ""Victory Lap""**

- Starts out great. For example, I got 98 and 95 on my first two calc tests despite not studying, though I did do all the homework this time around.

- My dad is diagnosed with terminal cancer, the day before my 18th birthday.

- Accidentally (no, really) tried out for my school's Sears Drama Fest play and got the lead role. Went on to win best lead in the local competition level. Felt nothing.

- Start making a mockumentary for the school's regular drama fest with my remaining elementary school friend. Once production ceases and the film is shown, we stop hanging out.

- Lost my virginity the day my dad died (Saturday June 6 2006) - probably in spite, as he died before I left my house for the party in question. I made this choice and I think it was a bad one. Nobody at the party was aware.

- I don't do my final exams, one teacher decides to give me a zero for the exam, I simply don't give a shit.

- Despite higher marks, obvious performance abilities, extenuating circumstances, and more than several letters of support from staff and teachers, I fail to get into UWO (University of Western Ontario). I apply late to Fanshawe College and go for some bullshit general arts degree (film major) because I have no idea what to do.

- Over the summer, I drift away from all but three of my highschool friends. The oldest, being one year behind me, becomes my best friend.

**Fall 2006, College**

- I quit my job due to stress.

- I start my first relationship.

**Spring 2007**

- I drop out of college because my film courses take a passionless bureaucratic turn, and I realise what little creativity I have can't fluorish in that sort of environment. I reapply for a two-year Computer Systems Technician degree beginning in the fall.

- I see a counsellor about four times to talk things out, and naively decide that I'm better.

- Best friend introduces me to weed. We proceed to get high every few days for two months.

- I get a job as a dishwasher.

- We introduce my girlfriend to weed, and I introduce her to my friend.

- Over a ~six-week period: They get closer. We drift apart. She spends the night at his place without me, twice. After doing buckets, I catch him kissing her when I walk back in the room. We break up a few days later and I start not hanging out with them.

**Fall 2007, College Again**

- I quit my job and stop going to class around the end of September. Coincidentally, Portal and TF2 are released soon after. I play these endlessly.

- After my birthday (20, ugh) I fall into a long and deep depression. I start riding the bus for hours to give the impression of going to class, knowing I can't keep up the charade. I don't care because I can't handle any stress at all.

- I drop out (er, withdraw) and start seeing a psychiatrist. I'm diagnosed with clinical depression.

- I reconnect with my ex and friend, and make a new friend in said friend's university buddy. We smoke up a lot.

- I begin my first internet relationship, and feel like I legitimately love someone for the first time. Turns out to be bullshit around March, and it really hurt me.

- I begin a second e-lationship early May, when I begin my Zoloft regimen. Zoloft turns me into an emotional zombie and gives me tremors, insomnia, and anorgasmia. I stop taking Zoloft around mid-July, and my relationship fizzles out soon after. I am again hurt.

- My family moves to a new house about four blocks away.

- I get a new job at another grocery store, working nights.

**Fall 2008**

- My younger sister accuses me (well, through talking to her highschool faculty) of touching her when we were much younger. She gives my mom an ultimatum (""Either he moves out or I do!""). This is total bullshit and I feel unfairly persecuted, even after a police investigation uncovers the nothing that I actually did. Everyone except my Mom refuses to look me in the eye or talk to me, and it sends me further into my depressive spiral.

- I move out with old best friend and new uni buddy into a shithole apartment. We proceed to smoke up a lot and collectively make poor financial decisions.

- I am fired from my job because management thinks I'm trying to bullshit them; I got a massive debilitating flu/cold sickness that prevented me from not sleeping for 18 hours a day and not occasionally shitting myself, which lasted two weeks, and began the day after we moved into the apartment. Understandable, but god damn this sucked.

- I get a new job at Quizno's.

- I get fired three months later because I ""did not perform adequately"". The reality is that I simply didn't (or couldn't) make friends with my co-workers. I end up having to ask my mom for rent money three times over my lease.

- I get a new job as a telemarketer, which eats away at my soul every day.

- ""Best friend"" decides to spirit away to Vancouver to live/work with his mom, promising to pay his share of the rent (which never happens). Through this, our lease goes into arrears and we are evicted mid-August. I move back home into the basement.",13,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2and/pity_rant_continued_in_my_comments/,1289086095
e2crd,depression,throwaway038257,"I want to get better but I don't think I can - arms and thighs covered in self harm scars, no friends.","I got out of the hospital about 5 months ago from my last suicide attempt... I am medicated, and I am trying to get better... But I don't think I can. I used to self harm, and my forearms are covered in thick, bumpy scars that are obviously from cutting. I can't wear t-shirts or short shorts (scars on thighs go down to knees), and I don't know if I will ever be able to make friends again. 

I have social anxiety, but this is too much I think... I am only recently feeling more lucid and seeing life as more colorful, (just started college again), but I don't know how I can make any friends like this. I mean, I wear sweaters and long sleeves everywhere, but I can't keep my arms covered forever like some kind of creep, not to mention even if I *do* eventually make friends with someone, they will be creeped the fuck out when the finally do see my arms. Plus I'm basically lying to them by not admitting that I have this problem.

I know that I will only slide back down into the hole I was in if I don't do anything to change my life now, but I feel like I am trapped because of the stupid things I've done. I'm essentially branded forever as a pathetic loser. People say that first impressions are what matter most when it comes to making friends, so it looks like I'm destined to be seen as a scary, pathetic weirdo. It doesn't help that I'm shy as fuck.

e2eqh,depression,inthewreckage,"I've had some pretty bad habits most of my life, and I feel they're getting out of control recently...","My life isn't going down the toilet... its already been flushed. I'm not working, I'm not in school. I can't manage to do anything, even just stepping outside of my door by myself is nearly impossible. I've been in and out of hospitals, I'm on meds and have been on and off different meds for years now. My one thing I had left was my relationship, and that's in the shitter too. I can't maintain any friendships or a healthy relationship because I'm not healthy or thinking straight or whatever. I serve no purpose. I've tried using the advice I've gotten from the hospitals, I've tried volunteering at a shelter, I've tried yoga to help ease anxiety and depression, I've tried writing, I've tried talk about things with the one or two people I can talk to (does it count of one of them is my therapist? lol). I've been discussing some deeper-rooted stuff I've never addressed, even though I've been with my same therapist for 7 years. I've been trying to get into another program thats supposed to be a more intensive type of individual therapy, but health insurance problems are preventing that. 

I've been a self0injurar since I'm a child, but it became a regular habit when I was 14. I'm 23 now. For a while I was able to control it a tiny bit, go for a while without it, or only do it on my thighs. But now its just full blown. I need to do it multiple times a day, in large enough quantities that I've already run out of room on my arms. My thighs are covered with scar tissue, so its tougher and not as satifying, but it does the job. I don't mean to be triggering for anyone, I'm sorry if I am. I just don't know how to handle it. a LARGE part of me doesn't want to handle it, and wants to cut to my heart's content. This past year I've also picked up the desperate habit of burning myself with lighters. I also abuse perscription pills. I've had numerous suicide attempts. this week I overdosed twice, was left onconscious and woke up to being covered in my own vomit and having peed myself. I actually lied to my psychologist and the pharmacy saying i had lost my medication, just so I could get more. Of which i've already popped a few and cut up my leg and wrist some more. I'm having to buy boxes of bandages every week, and all I can focus on is where I could possible cut next once there's no room left in my normal areas. I'm an emotional binge eater (I used to be bulimic) and I've started up purging again. Ugh...

I know this is the obsessive, avoidance part of self-injury. I cant talk about all this stuff very logically in conversation about others, or hypothetically. But when it comes to myself... I just feel like a pointless lost cause. For as much as I've tried to get better since around age 18 or so, everything has just gotten worse. I don't understand. If for me, my life is so hard to live, than why should I continue in this self-torture? Everyone says to do what makes them happy in their lives, but what if that thing is to disappear?

I guess I'm just looking for advice. For other who have trouble with SI, what do you do to try and decrease the urge? Hell, even if I still do it, I'd like to atleast cut down on the quantity... I have at the least 300 cuts on my body, not that i've counted exactly, but I've had less and counted over 200. I need to figure out how to stop. The cold weather isn't much motivation to control it either, since I can wear long sleeves without sweating or looking like a retard. 

I've tried hot chamomile tea, doing my nails, tweezing my eyebrows, holding ice cubes in my hands, writing, reading (I have no attention span anymore though), movies, looking up self-help websites.... but I feel lost and desperate. 

If anyone has any advice, please please please help me. I know that if things don't change anytime in the nearest future, I will attempt again, and I will do my darndest to not screw it up. The only reason now that I feel like I need to stay is because my mom is sick, and I can't imagine her going through it all alone... but depression and suicide bring out the selfish and self0absorbed side of a person, so I know I could easily overlook this fact if I were feeling bad enough.

help?

Also, I know I'll probably get a bunch of ""boos"" from the peantu gallery for this, but... pro-SI websites actually really help me. Seeing pictures and reading descriptions help me to feel like I'm not alone and like I'm not a bad person for doing it. Its cathartic. I can see it on a picture or read it online, and my urge to do it in real life with decrease. So anyone who wishes to offer me some help, please know that I'm open to every kind of help, even the pro-Si sites. I'm sorry if that sounds weird...

e2g5w,depression,Throwaway004019,A small inconsequential drop in the ocean.,"I started reading a few of the post in /r/depression lately, and I've found that I feel the same way a lot of the people here do. Sadly while reading, I didn't find anything that helped me, just people saying how they felt the same at some time excluding if they still do or not. It ended up making me feel very alone and got me thinking about how small and meaningless me life really is.

I'm still very young, only 18. I finished high school the past year, barely graduating. I've never had a girlfriend, or even heard through the grapevine of a girl liking me. I have never kept a ""friend"" for more then a few years. I have been becoming more and more apathetic to everything around me. I can't remember the last time that I felt anything except being unneeded. I have been trying to find a job (at least 1 application a day) and have still been unable to get even a few callbacks. I'm not artistic or creative. I've never done anything that won a prize, or even got enough praise to feel like it actually was good or different. 

Pretty much I just feel like I am a small drop in the ocean, and unneeded. I have started writing my thoughts down at the end of each day, and I don't feel that it is helping or hurting at all. I don't have the money for an real medical assistance, and I don't have a friend or anyone that I feel I can turn to and talk to. I figured that I should at least try reddit and see if you guys can help me at all.

e2gn8,depression,K-Bar,How to inspire myself with depression?,"Sorry for all the posts. It makes me kinda feel like a tool, but its the only place I can actually get stuff off my chest. 

I can't keep up with any hobby or passion with depression. I end up discouraging myself before I even start thinking ""What's the point? At this rate, it'll all be pointless anyway.""

I want to start working out again. I was doing great in my last year of college, but once Spring Quarter started, my depression got worse, and I stopped doing it. Now, its about six months later, and I'm still in the same place. I really want to start again, but I can't seem to find the motivation anymore. 

One big worry is that if I did it, and achieved that body I've always wanted, that's all I'll have. A hot body (which is argumentative, since I have NF1, and although its a minor case, bumps all over the tummy is probably a turn off to a lot of people. I don't know many that could get past something like that). I'll have an ok body with a not okay face. That if I lose weight, no man/woman (I'm pansexual) still will not want me. I'm pretty androgynous, so I get mistaken for a guy a lot. One because of my voice (but I can't do anything about that. I used to think a deep voice was kinda sexy to some, but I doubt it really). Two, because my face really isn't all that feminine. I'm a tomboy, but if I suddenly try methods to glam it up, it will just look wasted and awkward on me. 

I'm insanely jealous of people who aren't skinny, but are still cute and attractive. I know the whole excuse about ""personality"" does a lot, but I think outside of depression, I have a great personality (which more than enough people have said to me) and obviously, at 22 and never even being kissed, its not true. At least for me. 

But aside from all of this, I still need to do it. I just can't find my inspiration to do it. But, I'm imagining its my only shot at ever finding someone who's interested in something more than a friendship, I just need the support to do it. 

**edit:** I've been thinking about this thread. I hated posting it, because after the support, I feel a lot better than I did a minute ago. 

I think I do need to just force myself to make myself happy. Happier at least. I can enjoy the simple moments in life. Listening to music or writing a movie script like I did last night. Its fun, and it makes me feel good. I need to realize that small moments like that is what makes happiness, not looks.

I need to start focusing on what I am, what I have physically, and work with it. I'm not UGLY. I think I'm pretty average (seems like the only time I get hit on though, is by creepy, old, homeless guys). I do need to make some changes, but if I want to be a 'tomboy' then I can be one. I constantly get told I can't, and that's not what a lady should do, but what do they know about me? I'm friendly, funny, sensitive and pretty damn compassionate (for people other than myself at least). I don't see how wearing heels emphasizes that. I've meet a lot of glam gals that are HUGE bitches and no redeemable personality at all. True, they may get attention for their looks, but that's all it is. For the looks. I want something special. 

I'm fairly low maintenance, but I want have a body that looks good, not really for me, but for the person I may be able to attract with it. I want to be attractive to at least someone, because that way it would be a major intensive to keep it up. I'm a pansexual, but I do lean more in the direction of the ladies. I'm not ""butch"" by any means, but having a bit of muscle for cuddle purposes is a plus for me. I'm a nurturer, what can I say?

That...was a major stream of consciousness. Uh, thanks for the people that responded. I feel like I should delete my comments, since I didn't really believe in my words anyway, but that seems fake. I wrote them, I shouldn't have to hide it. Ignorance can only be fixed if you are aware of it, I guess.

My older son is almost 30 and has never found a life. This is about him.

As a child he was bright and athletic and terribly shy. He was also incredibly well behaved. Too much so - I remember telling him to put the books away and go play. From the time he was a preschooler he dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot. In middle school I had to take him to meet with a teacher so that he could understand that when she said she wanted a ""professional effort"" she wasn't addressing him but trying to motivate the rest of the class. He met his best friend of many years at that time.

He was a natural athlete with local soccer teams trying to ""recruit"" him when he was 10. He loved soccer and even though his father and I divorced when he was 4, his father made sure that he could afford to play for any team that he wanted.

Through high school he played soccer and studied hard, taking university classes during his junior year. During his junior year his father stepped up and said he'd help our son with the Air Force Academy application process. His father is a great schmoozer and successful businessman so they had dinner with the local recruiter and all the requirements were carefully spelled out for them.

During the latter half of his junior year I started getting calls from his father asking me to nudge our son to complete paperwork or take other action necessary for the USAFA application process. I could tell that our son was dragging his feet so I asked if he was certain that he wanted to attend USAFA. He maintained he was and even refused to submit applications to other schools. With high ACT and SAT scores, he was getting offers from schools, sight unseen, for a free ride. Still he wouldn't apply anywhere else.

His senior year he signed up for 1 class at his high school and the rest at the U. It took 2 weeks for me to realize that he wasn't spending any time at home on homework. I knew he had free time on campus and thought he was doing his work there but I finally asked him about it. 20 questions later I learned he had been getting up, showering and dressing, and heading out to ""school."" Only he didn't go to school; he waited until I was gone to work and went home.

He quit school at that point. While shocked, I realized that not every kid does everything in traditional ways and this was certainly not a traditional kid. While his father was flabbergasted, I knew that I couldn't force him to attend school so I told him he had a choice:  school or get a job. He promptly got a job. We met with his HS counselor who was willing to work him into classes at that late date but he refused and kept working. Then, of his own accord, he scheduled an appointment with his counselor and reentered high school for the 2nd semester. Due to his college credits from his junior year he was able to graduate with the rest of his class.

Before I found out that he had quit school, he continued to get dressed up and interviewed with congressional types in his quest to attend USAFA. I asked him why he did that if he wasn't going to finish HS. His reply:  They said great things about him and it felt good.

Well, he was rewarded. He received appointment letters from every congressional type he met. He had his choice of any military school in the US but they all respected his first choice and listed USAFA first.

He went to USAFA that summer. His letters to me were frequent and increasingly depressed. (Forgot to mention that as someone with chronic major depression, I recognized that he, too, was depressed.) When I received a letter talking about his thoughts of suicide I didn't know what to think, do, or say. I wrote to him every single day, driving nearly an hour one way to the airport post office if necessary to ensure that a letter went out every day. I wrote with all the encouragement I could. But when he finally was allowed to call home (Dooley Day Out) his talk was all about getting out of there. But he was worried about what his father would say.

I contacted other mothers of basic cadets who suggested I contact a chaplain as they have unfettered access to the cadets. While my son is an atheist, it felt like the safest way to have someone there visit and talk to him to learn his true state of mind.

About a week later I received a call saying that I should pick up my son at the airport with flight info. It turns out that he was very sick with strep and had a fever of 103 deg. when they moved him to the infirmary as the first step of processing him out. Had my call to the chaplain triggered his discharge when in reality he was just sick and needed treatment? I'll never know.

He has had all kinds of ups and downs, mostly downs, since then. At one point I was able to insist that he seek counseling. He knew he was suffering from depression and agreed to speak honestly to the psychiatrist. I left it up to him whether to take meds if they were recommended. My primary goal was to ensure he didn't have to wait the usual 6-8 weeks to see a psychiatrist for the first time if he experienced a crisis.

He tried meds (this was a number of years ago) and said they helped a little but he wasn't interested in them. As long as he maintained contact and I could visit him from time to time I felt that he was OK.

He's had 2 failed attempts to attend college. He cut his father out of his life for at least a year or 2 along the way. And now, this year, when his younger brother graduated from college, he cut me out too. He refuses to respond to any communications from me.

I have trouble periodically worrying about him. I can kind of push it to the back of my mind a lot of the time but recently it's been harder to keep it there. The absence of him in my life is like a festering wound that I can't seem to heal. This is something that I would never have expected in my wildest imaginings.

We didn't have a fight. But, looking back, I can see that I haven't known him (not for lack of trying) for nearly 15 years. He keeps all emotion to himself. I don't know how to reach him. I don't know if I should keep trying. I don't know how to go about my own life without periodic depressive episodes when I realize that another month or holiday has gone by with no word from him.

I am just coming up from a day from Hell. Yesterday I completely crumbled into the pit but I knew it was centered solely around my concern about my son. Today I'm very shaky.

I don't know any other parents whose adult child has done severed ties in this manner so I don't know what possible outcomes there are. I don't have any more ideas about how to breach the divide.

I write short, cheerful notes from time to time. I leave brief, upbeat messages on his phone occasionally. I sent an invitation to come for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas and asked that he let me know. I've asked that he just email or IM me and let me know if he's OK. The silence is deafening.

About me - I'm clear about my depression. I have great medical care for it and take meds regularly. I know that if it weren't for the meds I'd be suicidal. When I was a small child (as young as age 5 or 6) I frequently wished I had never been born or when I went to bed I would ""pray"" that I wouldn't wake up. It's genetic and it's strong.

Does anyone have any ideas? Any experience with a situation like mine? Thanks, if you've read this far.

tl;dr My (depressed) son has completely shut me out of his life. I'm scared for him and it's eroding my own life.

**Edit** - OMG, I just realized how much I made this about my suffering. I guess that's because it's my suffering that drove me to post.

My suffering, though, is secondary to my son's. If I knew that he was doing OK and just didn't want me in his life right now, I think that would be much easier to deal with. I suspect there is still something he needs from me but damn_it_so_much seems to have hit the nail on the head. I can only guess but I think he might want to handle life on his own and sees seeking help as yet another ""failure"" to add to his perceived list of failures. Through his sports and other events when he was growing up I tried to teach that ""failures"" are a natural part of life and mostly learning experiences.

Of course, guesses and thinking don't identify the problem(s) or issue(s) he's having.

I also see how jumbled my original post was. To clarify - I'm very proud of son. He has worked hard and, I suspect, struggled too much. I admire and respect him as well. I was well into my 30s before I was diagnosed with depression so I know how hard that fight is. It feels to me like he is fighting other battles, ones that he won't/can't share with me.

**Edit2** - I am beyond words with gratitude for the opportunity to ""talk"" about this issue with such a broad range of people. Your honesty and your insights are all important because I know that I have to make a decision that I can live with for now. I lacked thoughts from people who could look at the situation from different perspectives.

Also, a special thank you for those who protested my deletion. I hadn't looked at my post from your perspectives. I'm accustomed to seeing eyes glaze over when I talk about this with the few friends and family who know me well; I didn't want to add something of less than no value to reddit and expected a lot less than I received.

Any other comments, perspectives are still very much welcome. I will be checking here frequently. Thanks, all of you.",43,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2jfh/my_30_yo_son_has_dropped_out_of_my_life_i_worry/,1289150693
e2lyz,depression,MotivationIsHard,How do I overcome an all encompassing lack of motivation?,"I can't find myself to be motivated in most everything I do, regardless of whether I want to do it, or not.  I need to REALLY want to do something and have almost no negative factors involved with doing that thing.  

I've been dealing with this since I was young, and the only reason I've ever gotten things done is due to me placing a great deal of weight on what others think of me, which can motivate me from a desire to not be embarrassed, or from a desire to please the people around me.  When that wasn't sufficent to motivate me, I developed and projected a very negative perspective of myself on others to give myself the motivation to please them.  That developed into a paranoia of people always watching me and judging me negatively.  The only thing that can really get me through the workday is fear of being fired, which I still feel even in a job I really enjoy.

I've taken medicine througout the years but I could never remember to take it.  I feel like my life it at a standstill, with so much I want to do but can't be motivated to do the necessary steps involved. DAE ever feel this way? Did they find solutions to work around this?

and what have i done with my 20s?  they were wasted.  i spent the majority of my 20s languishing in a job i hated, didn't even fuck any random girls, or engage in a *meaningful* relationship, or do *anything* of any significance.  it all meant nothing.  and my body and mind continue to degrade.  it feels like nothing changes but everything is passing so quickly.  stale and fleeting.  i have no plans for the future- no career goals, no girlfriend i can marry and start a family with, no hobbies i am passionate about.  nothing.  all i can see for the future is the death of my parents, the slow drift of friends away from me as they start their own families, the happiness of others, but for me:  nothing.  eternal isolation.  

it's hopeless.  i cannot help myself.  i've tried and tried and tried but nothing can control my insanity.  hidden, of course, from everyone.  maybe that's why i knowingly use women who are interested in me for physical pleasure (even if it's not sex), and have typically avoided relationships- but now, am i even capable of that?  right now, i can barely look at a woman without feeling anxious, without a flood of anxiety, without worry.  how can i form a meaningful bond with someone if i'm broken?  why are my sexual urges almost completely dead?  why can i barely get an erection with the girl that i broke up with?

i will die alone.  when the loneliness is overwhelming, when i reach a place that i cannot handle, maybe i'll even do it myself- you know, it runs in my family.  an uncle and, i think, great-uncle and many other attempts.  maybe i'll be the next one.  maybe not tomorrow, or next week, but i cannot accept the perfection of this moment.  i cannot stop my mind from grasping at alternatives.  i cannot stop the obsessive worry.  i cannot stop the ruminations.  but maybe, one day, i'll have the courage to stop them.  to stop this.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2mer/it_feels_like_nothing_changes_but_everything_is/,1289165474
e2mz8,depression,AmericansAbroad,what am I missing here?,"Hey /r/depression.... 25 year old male

I've got a cool job, close friends, I'm healthy, I'm smart, and my looks are peaking - this should be the prime of my life. But, I'm struggling with a large amount of apathy and it's making me depressed.

My home life has dissolved into smoking weed in my underwear, reading, and working out. This is all I do outside of feeding myself.

The rare times I've been happy the past few months involved doing stupid and dangerous things. Theft is a new interest and I've been stealing small food items I could easily afford (making ~$45k). Besides that I've been having unsafe sex and drinking to excess when I do leave my apartment.

All of this is accumulating into a general frustration with myself and my life. I've met some beautiful, smart women this summer, most of which I did not pursue. The few that I did sleep with I had no emotional connection with and the sex was bad.

I think the only thing that will save me is falling in love with someone again. I've been looking and talking to everyone I come across, but nobody has sparked that feeling in me. I feel jaded from my last relationship and I'm wondering if love actually exists and if I'm capable of it.

Should I just keep living this boring sham life until someone comes along and I fall in love again? I think I'd make a shitty boyfriend at this point and the girls can sense that.

The alternative would be going out and faking an interest in dining, partying, and attending cultural events. This sounds worse to me than sitting at home being a bum. I need a reason for being and I don't think a relationship built of false pretenses should be it. 

I'm running out of steam so let me know if there's any relevant information I'm missing here. Would really appreciate advice from anyone who has felt like this themselves.

(edit: I also wanted to mention that I've been crying spontaneously recently, more than I ever have before. Watching movies, listening to songs, reading books, when drunk, when high, and when I watched that recent reddit hit about that fixed-gear rider and his dog.

The trick for me was to do it. I was lucky and had a friend to kick my ass if I didn't.

This may not work for you, but if one in a 1000 reads this and is inspired, then good.

1. Made *that* appointment with the doctor. Got pills, got a referral and *went and filled the prescription and kept taking them*

2. Rang or visited all my friends whom I had ever hurt through alcohol and apologised. The list was long, as was the list of those that offered to help. Plenty of tears were shed, on both sides.

3. Manned up to my boss about my depression. I am lucky in this regard - my employer regularly runs (say once every 12 months) sessions on depression in the workplace and my boss has a degree in biochemistry, so get's the chemical basis. She rocks. Got a week off (well ""as much time as I needed"" but a week).

4. Cleaned my apartment. Got rid of all my exes stuff (all of them, I've had 3 in the last 36 months)

5. Wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote.

My good friends from home called to wish me a happy birthday, but there were a few notable exceptions that I was hoping to hear from. So in general it was just a let down. Given my friend situation here at school, I just didn't feel like it was a special day for me.

e2s0j,depression,sundaryourfriend,Some CSS magic to better indicate the motivating posts from those asking for help?,"There are mainly two kinds of posts on this subreddit: Those from depressed people asking for help, and those from helpful people providing resources that might help. These posts are also intended for entirely different audiences: the first kind towards the people who post the second kind, and vice versa. 

So my suggestion is that we separate these two kinds of posts by some visual indication so that it reaches the right audience. As someone recovering from depression, I have to admit that there have been quite a few times when I've come to this subreddit for solace, only to have my negative thinking reaffirmed by others in depression, and have ended up worse than before. 

One thing to note is that it is probably too much to ask people in mounting pain to remember to mark their posts with something every time. So I'd propose that posts are by default considered to be someone asking for help, unless it's tagged by some magic phrase. Something like [Resource] feels right (with [Request] being the optional counterpart), though it perhaps is not too clear - what do you think?      
Also, the phrase by itself may be useful, but coloring the posts differently or some other similar magic might be even more useful. 

If we agree on some good way of doing this, we might post the request to r/SomebodyMakeThis and get it done. 

Edit: It would be awesome if it's possible to dim out the negative posts by default (implicitly assuming a person is here asking for help) and ""undim"" them after we check something like ""I'm a volunteer, no problem for me"".    
The folks at r/Android are doing all sorts of magic with CSS and getting input from users about carriers, etc., so a simple volunteers/others checkbox shouldn't be a problem I hope. ",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2s0j/some_css_magic_to_better_indicate_the_motivating/,1289192418

I got a place of my own and dropped out 2 months later because I could not pay for school and my apartment at the same time. After dropping out I got kicked out of my apartment and stayed at my friend for a good year. I found a girlfriend and she offered me to move in with her and this was the greatest time of my life, I was able to make some money every month and pay the rent. 


The year following our breakup my life went downhill really fast. Mett the wrong people, noticed that my old friends did not have any interest in my anymore and got depressed. I was behind on my rent for 5 months I often wouldn't eat anything for 2-4 days. Obviously I got kicked out after a while and I called my real dad who was living in another country if I could stay with him for a while till I sorted out some stuff. 


Moving there for a while was the best decision I could have made because the only alternative would have been being homeless. I lived there for 2 years and it was a living hell. My dad did not have a job, was an alcoholic and would come into my room a few times every week telling me how much of a shitty son I was. I managed to make a bit of money and wanted to save it for school or at least to get the fuck out of there, but whenever he noticed he took at least half because he needed to pay the ""rent"" too and no pay would mean he would kick me out. The best thing he ever did was laugh into my face and told me I was an idiot after I sat down with him and told him I was feeling depressed all the time because of we how we where threating eachother. After that happened I really did not give a shit anymore, I took unwanted risks in order for me to get away from him, make his life worse if possible and just hope he will forget me. 



Last December I told him I was going to leave to the Netherlands (home country) by Februari 2010 by any means even if it would mean I would have to be homeless. I made a few calls to my mom and she told me my stepdad did not want to have me there anymore....fine by me, I would leave anyways. I did something I am good at and something I only resort to in moments like these, something I hate myself for..and I made about 500 euros illegally. I send another email to my mom which must have sounded quite suicidal (not on purpose) because she mailed me the same day and even called me that it was ok to stay there for a few weeks. 


I moved there and slept on the ground on a make shift bed made out of blankets for the following 4 months till I was able to afford a matress. I would never really talk to my parents at all. This summer I made some decent money over the internet and saved it up to get my own apartment from where I am writing this post right now. My life seemed pretty much on track. I had bills and debts but that was the least of my concern, I was getting money each month and was able to pay for my rent and food. Even tho everything sounds perfect I really don't know if I could feel any shittier. 



The last 4 years have been a living hell for me and even tho my life is going great I am still suffering from it. I can't relate to nobody anymore people just seem to be like everyday objects to me living their life, I don't really care what they think or what they do or what their opions are and it saddens me. People want to be my friends now but whenever I hang out with them I want them to leave as soon as possible so I can be alone by myself. In those last 4 years I have turned into this social awkward blob of insecure person that I hate. Before I could walk around feel great, flirt with girls and talk up random people. Right now I feel like everybody that doesn't know is avoiding me for me being me, and girls aren't even looking because i'm probably pretty ugly =/. 



I started talking to my ex I dated in highschool a few months ago, we would talk for 5-10 hours a day over skype and had an awesome time. But then when she asked me if she could meet me again for a booty call (yes) I pussied out and came up with mistakes, and then another and another time since I diddn't want her to see me. I bought a webcam and we started to cam, after the first day she stopped talking to me and i took a huge hit because this just comfirms that i'm indeed not the person I was a few years ago..... 



Last week I made an appointment with a physchologist and he will be calling me next week. I think its a step into the right direction but I have no clue where to start talking about my problems and my thoughts. I could write them down but then I still don't know where to talk since I feel that there is SO much wrong with me =/. 


Right now I feel pretty depressed but I have never really been suicidal i'm always thought about saving that if I ever reach a point of no return. Whats funny is that I have been talking about suicide and killing myself since I have been 10 or 12. Whenever somebody would ask me how I thought I would die I would answer that I would throw myself of a building or shoot myself trough the head at the age of 50 =/....Well not that funny perhaps. 

I exercise each day and have a pretty healthy diet but the main thing concerning me is how I look, what I wear and what other people think about me even tho when they think something about me I do not care. I also have no sense of fashion to make it worse. I have a closet of 50 almost identically looking stuff. Some of them are really thight fitting stuff and some of them are baggy and I just mix them.


**So thats my story**.... I really don't know why I am posting this here but its something I needed to get off my chest.

e2uol,depression,_ActivitY_,Finding a girlfriend is like a job application.,"I don't really want to come across as suicidal or depressed to other people so I always keep on my happy face. No one knows how I feel, or ever will.

My problem is this: 

Every time I ask for a girl's number she either gives me a fake or asks for my number instead and never calls (and that's if I'm lucky). I haven't felt like this since I spent 2 years looking for a job, except this has been going on for almost 7 years now. I know it's something to do with me, but no one ever says why. It's been like this for all of my adult life and it's killing me. I try my hardest not to look like a basket case or some desperate guy, I act like I'm not a virgin due to the stigma. 

A perfect example of this happened on the weekend. I went out to see a couple of local rock bands on my own since none of my friends were keen to come out with me. I went up to a girl I found attractive and tried to strike up some small talk about the band that was playing and she seemed really interested, until some jerk came over to her and said (so that I could hear it) ""This guy looks like he's boring you, you want to talk to me instead?"" and she just walks off with him without even mumbling a single word.

I decided to take this into my stride and kept it up, saw another girl about an hour later and offered to buy her a drink. She took the drink and just walked off, without even saying a word. 

This is the type of thing that always seems to happen to me, despite acting confident, wearing sweet threads, being a jerk, being a nice guy, being myself - I swear I've tried every combination I can think of, and still I get left alone like I'm wearing a damn perception filter. 

I don't know what is so unpleasant, or unappealing about me - I'm a nice guy, I've been told I'm not bad looking. 

I don't feel like killing myself - I only feel like giving up and becoming some reclusive guy. Some guy who's closest form of social interaction is peering out of my front window occasionally and lurking on the internet.

I don't expect a reply to this post (though it would be cool), I just needed to get this off my chest somewhere public, with anonymity. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the excellent constructive criticism! From the comments I've been able to extrapolate the following; I expect absolute perfection from myself at all times, maybe when I fall short I shouldn't throw myself to pieces like a dryer that's had a cinder block thrown in. Not be such a suck up/nice guy. Don't be discouraged by flat out rejection, don't make women out to be some perfect goddess (at least not until I'm a little bit deeper into a relationship) and try other social clubs, friends of friends rather than just randoms.",39,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e2uol/finding_a_girlfriend_is_like_a_job_application/,1289208253
e2w6m,depression,InTr0ubl3,"Am I depressed, unmotivated or just a slob?","Right now I feel my life is going to change for the worst. 

I am 3 semesters away from finishing university, I'm 3 weeks away from finishing this semester, and I can't bring myself to finish the papers. I want to do them because I feel stressed about them, I really want to, I'd love to see a good grade but I can't bring myself to do it. What I'm studying is not really what I want to study, but if I fail this semester I'll be banned from any university in my country for 5 years (that's how it is here I believe). 

I tried to fight procrastination by trying to make a schedule for myself to organize my time, I tried the pomodoro technique (I printed like 20 of those pomodoro sheets... they're around here, somewhere, completely empty), but nothing works I just don't want to continue with this but, I am so close...

If I get my title I would have chances for a better job, a job at something I don't like, but still getting better paid than a job with no title at all. I would have liked to be a musician but I was never given that chance. My family thinks that one has to be born with it. They told me it was a waste of time cuz music makes no money (and I was stupid enough to believe them, I was a stupid introverted 18 yold so I believed everything they said). Since non of them have any music skills they though I wouldn't have it in me. Now I'm, 25 and too old to study what I'd like to.

I don't want to fail. I want to stop being a burden to them and to myself. The first step is to finish what I've started but I can't. I have even stopped talking to classmates because I don't want to discuss my bad grades or my absence in some classes. Sometimes I just don't feel like going there so I just make up excuses (I think I have mastered that art by now) but now the excuses wont save me. There's a subject in which I haven't done even the 1st thing and just thinking about it makes me sick.

I feel like if I was in a car with no brakes, going 100mph straight into a brick wall... I want to know how to change this fast enough to not crew up my life completely.

e362l,depression,VoltGat,Thank You To Whoever Reads This,"I know that this is going to be long. I'm just so unhappy so much, maybe there's one detail that someone picks up on. 

While I wasn't poor or deprived as a child, I was continually verbally and, to a lesser extent, physically abused by the children and sometimes teachers (verbal only) at my school. I lived abroad, and it was the only English school in the area, so I couldn't leave. My parents tried to help me with ""They're just jealous"" and stuff like that, but it wasn't of any aid. 

The last time I remember crying is age 7, because it showed weakness. I haven't been able to cry since, even during some of my relative's (who I was close to) funerals or even from pain when I got hit by an SUV while biking. This was also the age where I threatened to kill myself with a butterknife on my chest in front of my Mom, who burst out crying. We haven't talked about it since.

When I moved back to the states, I was introverted. Throughout middle school I made transitory friends, avoided girls who liked me and stayed in my room and on my computer.
In the summer before high school I changed my appearance. Got contacts, styled my hair. Still didn't feel better about myself.

In high school I became kind of a jerk to people. I had some friends, all but 2 turned out to be transitory. I think I was mean to protect myself from getting hurt, but I really didn't feel anything.

In 10th grade my health problems started. I had played sports since age 5. While I had asthma and tight achilles, I could still run. Both knees began to get sharp stabbing then aching pains, and I couldn't run anymore. I had to stop sports and all activity. No doctor could figure out what the problem was, and gave it a vague diagnosis. I also was always fatigued and sleepy, falling asleep in classes and on the bus etc. I also was unable to get to sleep at night, my mind was always racing. It was an unfortunate circle of sleeplessness and restlessness. No doctor could figure this out either.

The first year of college I became incredibly depressed, not wanting to leave my room, get out of bed. I ate constantly. I started seeing a therapist then also a psychiatrist. I had a friend from high school at the college, and hung out with them solely, and their friends. Not only was I depressed, I was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and pills started promptly. I do have anxiety problems, and I get overwhelmed easily. Pills didn't help, and I sunk deeper into my depression. I hated myself and my problems, everything was wrong with me and nothing could help

I transferred schools after a year. I joined a few clubs, but still remained introverted. I still was depressed, tired, anxious, in pain and wholly undesirable. I tried working out, dieting and got a bit skinnier. It didn't help. I still hated myself. I began seeing multiple specialists, and got surgery on one of my knees. The surgery made the pain worse. I was diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy and placed on stimulants. The anti-depressant and anti-anxiety pills continued, painful acid-reflux and pills for it continued.

It's now my last year of college. All anti-depression and anxiety pills haven't done anything. My psychiatrist here has stopped them. I figured out how to run in spite of the pain, but I can't last long. The stimulant medication works, but Im still tired. Im in pain constantly, with no help from the multiple drugs or therapies. My therapist and I mutually agreed that I wasn't gaining any help from therapy. She was my 4th therapist. I still hate myself, I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. I don't know how I'm not suicidal yet, but I did consider it this weekend. Not how I would do it, but I couldn't figure out any reason why I shouldn't except that my parents and small group of friends would be sad. 

I'm 20 and I have no idea what to do in the future, and can't find any job opportunities after college. My work has been in steep decline, and I feel that my intelligence is all but gone, slowly degrading for some reason. I can't focus, I can't relax. I've had every test done to me, and psychologically I'm just depressed and anxious, no bipolar or schizophrenia etc. No doctor can adequately figure out anything other than that I have Chronic Pain Syndrome. 

Lastly, I don't have emotions. I don't feel anything. I can't tell you the last time I was happy, because I truly think that I've never been truly happy. I'm broken, and I don't see a way out. 

For whoever reads through all this, I sincerely thank you.

e37lq,depression,BrokenwoSon,Broken without Son,"Hi,

I feel like I need some sort of life advice... if nothing else at least I feel like writing all of this and putting it out there into the universe is a load off my back.  I wouldn't quite say I'm suicidal but I do feel like I am living in really dark times for myself and it feels like with every step I take things are only getting worse.  If I make another wrong turn I fear for where I will be in a week or two.  A year ago I would have never imagined to have been where I am today, so the thought of where I will be in a year from now is scary but I feel that if my life could have crumbled to this within a few months then there is hope that it can turn around within months as well.

My stress currently:
Early in 2010 my ex fiance decided that she was no longer going to work towards remaining in our relationship and started perusing someone from her past that she had a crush on.  If this was any girlfriend I would have said ""peace out"" and ""be on your way"" and that's more or less what I said in this situation but we have a child together.  I was willing and trying to work on things for the sake of the child but it wasn't going any where b/c she didn't want any part of it.  I've come to terms with that, and am at peace without her being in my life but it's not being near my son that breaks my heart.  In late summer she moved 2,000 miles away to be closer to her family and now I have limited access to information about my son.  It was brought to my attention that I could have temporarily stopped her from moving until custody was settled (?) but I didn't want to fight as I was a child of a divorce and dealt with all of the drama that comes with that.  Since not having access to my son I've been pretty miserable, living on the bottom of the barrel, scraping to get by.  I recently graduated with a degree in art but it feels as if that type of work is only possible for me when I am in better spirits.   I don't know what to do right now... I've been asking friends for advice for the past few months and no one has said anything other than ""people are resilient, you'll bounce back""... I don't feel like I am bouncing back... or anywhere close to it... I'm afraid I'm going to feel this broken for the rest of my life.  I'm afraid my son will grow up thinking that I don't love him.

e37ry,depression,[deleted],I fucked my life up beyond repair and now I want sympathy ,"A few months ago I drop out of university, which was my only chance at a better life seeing how I come from a small village in Serbia.

Back home, I got depressed. Didn't study for my driving test (having a car and a licence is a prerequisite for anything when you're rural) which I will now fail. Just one failure after another.

I snapped today. I kept visiting my school's forum, just in case I manage to return, to keep in touch. Also had friends from class on Facebook.
Today I argued with someone online, on that forum. They called my arguments laughable, I told him to suck my cock. How academic of me.
He was right. My arguments sucked and I was a douche about it. That's an IQ of 85 for you. So close, yet so far away.
So now that everyone from my class know what a stupid prick I am, I deleted my facebook and twitter and I won't keep in touch with anyone. I was getting too hard seeing them everyday on Facebook anyway.

Now my life is over. I'll be a townie, a mediocre human being that's completely worthless. I'll have friends because they don't take kindly to gay people here. And I won't ever have a relationship that goes beyond sticking my dick in someone's ass because everyone's in the closet.

I'm a failure, I'm lazy and unmotivated and dumb. I'll fuck up my job too, I'm sure of it.
Maybe I can be a basement dweller or something.

e38mo,depression,InternetCitizen,The Greys,"Hi, 19 year old college student here. I suppose I should start by saying that my life is going extremely well. I am going to my top choice school, which is one of the best in the world for the subject I'm interested in. My grades are good, and I'm on track to keep them that way. I also have a great job waiting for me when I'm done with school.

Now, that being said, I feel like a robot. I do everything I'm supposed to, but my life is basically devoid of any sort of enjoyment. There are still some things that can positively affect my mood, but these are few and far between, so I just feel... empty most of the time.

We were in high school when we met, and I was just out of highschool when it all happened. I didn't take it then, and around the time of her death (early september) I usually get really depressed, to the point where my friends don't let me stay alone (thank god for them).

Her friends and I got along great, and when everything happened, we all drifted apart because it was awkward as hell. Well, I moved away early this year, and have had trouble meeting people. There was a convention this time last month that was straight up amazing, and I met a ton of people there. We were hanging out at Buffalo Wild Wings....eating wings and drinking beer. I was told a ton of people would be showing up later, and after an hour (and several people later) my late fiancee's former best friend walks in. She couldn't stop staring at me, making me awkard as hell. I knew who she was right when she walked in (I couldn't forget the look on her face as we put her childhood best friend in the ground) and she recognized me, but didn't know from where.

I started talking to some people about who she was (Hey, who'se that cute girl over there? Never seen her before) to get some backstory as to how she ended up here. Apparantly she moved up here with her parents not long after it all happened, and that was that. She met the group at the year's previous convention, and started hanging out with them. 

Well, I usually feel good after a month or so, but after seeing her again, I just fell deep into the horrible depression that usually happens anyway.

Right now, I'm feeling pretty hopeless because of my lack of activity and could use some reassurance.  Am I completely screwed when it comes to finding a decent job when I graduate?

I think it started when I was very young, but I think for protective reasons I don't remember much of my childhood.  I was bullied everyday I was in elementary school.  Physically, verbally, I don't really remember a day where I didn't cry myself to sleep, which unfortunately made my brother whom I shared a room with all my life aware that I was upset.  But he was only a grade below me so when we went to school it seemed like everyone knew I was upset, which seemed to make me an even bigger target.  I am shocked to this day at how purely evil kids can be.  Fast forward to middle school, nothing really changed except now I played soccer.  I was no good at all, to this day I am really no good.  but now I had to spend an extra hour with my peers, who all seemed to hate me.  they bullying still never stopped it just got worse, but I could see that their were other people who were no good at soccer and were taking shit from the teammates as well.  I thought we could band together and protect ourselves, but being the manipulative children todays society creates, the good players were able to quit picking on some kids just so that they would pick on the others for them, the cycle was never ending, I always wanted to quit but my parents would never let me quit unless I joined something else.  while in middle school I was finally able to find friends that I truly cared about and to this day they truly care about me.  While in middle school  my best friend went through this cutting phase.  I can still remember the day I went over to his house to play and we were in his kitchen when he snapped in front of me and his mom. he grabbed a knife and started cutting his arm.  me and my friends did our best to try to help him and something we did must have worked because now he is just a normal college kid, he has lost much of the darkness that seemed to plague him when we were younger.  Moving on to highschool, the bullying in sports got out of hand.  one of the upperclassman who was picked on ended up getting severely injured because of a senior.  the senior had the kid get in the back of his truck.  for whatever reason he slammed on his brakes send the kid in the bed flying.  he had to get a steel plate inserted into his skull because of what had happened.  about two weeks ago I found out that the kid had taken his life, stating he felt he didn't belong.  It baffled me, he had gone to college graduated and landed a job working for the university he attended.  Yet he still felt he didn't belong in this world.  The hazing got so bad the administration for the school district had a talk with our team about what was going on, but it did nothing.  In 11th grade, I finally got a girlfriend, I loved her she loved me.  I was so afraid of not knowing what to do with her though that we never even kissed.  I was paralyzed by my fear of something new, that I had never done before.  it is my understanding that this is why we broke up but I really do not know, I have never gotten closure from the incident and I don't think I ever will. But we broke up in october of my senior year.  since that moment I have not made a positive choice in my life.  maybe after a week of being broken up with my girlfriend I began to date her best friend.  that made my ex hate me, we are on ok terms right now but we really don't keep in contact.  I let my new girlfriend lead the way because I was so paralyzed by my fear of the unknown. It got to the point where everyone said I was whipped, which I don't dispute, I stayed with her for I think three years, we graduated and I went to a local college with no idea as to what I wanted to do with my future.  my parents never saved a dime for any of us to go to college but I don't blame them for that.  since I had been born my family had always lived with my grandparents.  My parents had four kids and my dad was the only one who worked.  My oldest sister(four years older then me) had her first kid at 17(my mom had her at 15 me at 19 brother at 20 and youngest sister at 21).  My freshman year in highschool we moved in with my moms best friend for a few months because my grandfather has always been an alcoholic we eventually found a place near our school and we began to pay rent on a house that was always too small for us. my senior year my family found out that our dad had an affair with my moms best friend.  my parents are still together but I hate my dad for that.  I hate my mom for the fact that she hasn't worked a job in 20 years and we really have never been making it.  Anyway I began going to a community college, I took out a 20,000 grand loan, I payed for one year of school 8,500$ after aid ,bought a cheap 400 dollar laptop and a cheap 2,000$ car,  the rest of that money was spent by my parents for the family I assume because I found out when I went to go for my second year the money was gone.  I was angry at my parents angry at my girlfriend, angry at everyone, I just wanted to get away. I managed to move to pittsburgh to go to an artschool I couldn't afford.  I used my girlfriends parents to cosign my student loans I went for half a year, met a wonderful girl and began to cheat on my girlfriend, she found out and I had to drop out.  To this day she would still take me back but I hate her so fucking much I can't put it into words.  sometime while I was in pittsburgh I got a parking ticket which unknowingly became outstanding and my license was suspended, after a night of heavy drinking with one of my buddies I got a ride out to his car while he was still passed out and drove it home where we had been staying, on my way home, a guy ran a stop sign and tboned me from the drivers side.  I got my license further suspended and added some medical bills to my outstanding debt.  I totaled up my debt from my life so far, I am currently 21 years old with 80000 in debt plus intrest.  I have no clue what to do, I am still living with my parents working for my dad some days but making no money. working with my dad keeps me in the house and keeps my cellphone paid.  The heat in my room doesn't work the ceiling about my bed is cracking and leaking and getting worse every time it rains.  My brother moved out, he is a welder getting shit pay but its enough to get him by with his girlfriend.  my little sister is now joining the military because she realized this year(her sophomore year) that she can't afford school on her own either.  

Basically I need some advice on how to change my situation I am currently on probation and should be getting off the 17th assuming I can find a way to pay the 1200 I now owe the court system, I got probation for having one marijuana pipe in my pocket when my friend got pulled over(same friend whom I totaled his car even though the other guy ran the stop sign). I just feel like my whole life I have been getting shit on.  I have ideas on what to do, stage my death and run away to europe, try to save up enough money to declare bankruptcy and join the army(not the most physically fit), but really I have no idea what I am doing with my life, now or in the future.  I haven't had sex in like two years now, I just fucking hate my life. I've lost everything I owned, my car, my tv, my xbox, my good relationships.  everyone else got out of this god awful town and I can't do it.  all I have left now is a few outfits 5 pairs of socks, one set of worn out sneakers and this broken laptop.  Please someone try to give me an idea of what to do, i tell myself everyday their is someone worse off then me, but I really don't know what to do.  

TL;DR I fucked up my life and am trying to find a way to fix it",7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e3h3h/please_advise/,1289313640
e3jwl,depression,smithb1444,my mind feels like its crumbling away,"i don't feel like i have any kind of relationship with anyone, the last 3 months since i moved here i haven't been able to connect with anyone.
the last time i had anything i would call a ""friendship"" or ""relationship"" with anyone was with my older brothers, but now they're across the country and i know i need to learn to connect with other people..

i used to play WoW to extreme levels, depriving myself of adequate nutrition, sleep, and real achievement. the last 3-4 months I've quit video games all together, got my BMI into the ""normal"" range (using cardio and better diet), but i also have been smoking tons of weed to quell my loneliness.

i can't connect with my parents because all they are to me is mindless automatons regurgitating societal memes, not even engaging their working memories.

i see everyone around me so uninterested with broad trends in the world, or amazing groundbreaking and inspiring things we're doing as a human race. i see them instead satiating themselves with things they're told will make them happy, but are really just forms of self-worship, and regurgitation. 

when i see people connecting with each other i see that they connect through humor but immediately i see humor as masked sadism, a sense of gratification and accomplishment from the pain of another. Humor also expresses what we consider absurd, and most people express that NOT accepting the status quo is absurd; they disregard and rationalize all the dangers that confront us as a race, resource scarcity, population growth, climate change, war, our society is crumbling and it's apparent that greed and selfishness cannot be the center of our society

but everywhere around me all i see is people totally OK with whats going on

the only person ive met that i think i could connect with is a crazy mexican chick with cervical cancer who does coke and smokes weed dangerous amounts of weed (yes coming from an ent i would consider an ounce in a day way too much). and i find myself doubting even the potential of that friendship because i fear that my perceptions of her are morphed from my strong and unfulfilled desire to connect with people. 

i remain paralyzed :\

I feel overwhelmingly inadequate and overwhelmingly unwilling to accept mere adequacy as a goal. i feel like im pushing myself to hard and have no idea towards what.

I know that vaguely i want to strive for excellence and betterment of myself and i know that it will not be achieved if i cannot form relationships or interact adequately in a social environment but i have no idea where to start, social ""rules"" change so frequently and arbitrarily its an acquired and improvisational skill that i feel ive lost.",4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e3jwl/my_mind_feels_like_its_crumbling_away/,1289323031
e3loe,depression,[deleted],How long does an AD really take?!,"I've been on Nortriptyline (a tricyclic) for about a month and a half, and currently my dose is at 60mg/day.  I've read that 150mg/day is the absolute max dose you can take of Nortriptyline, but I don't feel any different, only worse.  My pdoc wants me to stay on it and I'm supposed to go up to 75mg/day a week from now, but I don't think it's working :(.  I feel like I'm having a good day, then a bad day and the cycle repeats.  On the days I feel good, I feel like everything is a piece of cake and that I'm perfectly fine.  Then I wake up the next day to suicidal thoughts and depression.  Today has been pretty crappy, but yesterday was a really good day.  Is that how the AD is supposed to work, do my good days start lasting longer eventually?  On bad days, I feel like I'm a worthless piece of shit and that there's no point to life.  Every object I look at turns into a suicidal thought of using that object (like jumping in front of a car), but at this point they aren't serious thoughts, I just don't want to have them.  I feel like I've messed up my entire life, even though I haven't done anything wrong. 

EDIT:  I think what I'm trying to figure out is how do I tell the difference between the AD working sporadically or me having a bad reaction to it?  What worries me the most is when I become extremely irritable, likely whole body is itchy and jittery and everythin makes me angry. I was feeling really depressed earlier today until I went to class. During class I noticed the ""empty"" feeling went away and I started feeling irritable and almost left class cause felt like I needed to move and make my brain stop running. I told the pdoc about these things last week but she increased my dosage. ",6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e3loe/how_long_does_an_ad_really_take/,1289328948
e3ls3,depression,nomoreoptions,"Nothing really to say.  No options.  No point.  Not even sure why I'm writing this.  Just nice to get it out, I guess.","Throwaway account.  So I don't really know where to start.  This is going to be TL;DR and rambling and I am sorry for that.

I would say that I'm at my wit's end, except that that implies some sort of exasperation, anger, frustration, something.  In fact I feel like I'm way beyond that.  I'm a sponge that is completely squeezed dry.  I'm an ember that has already cooled completely.  I'm left feeling like I should feel some sadness or anger, but instead there's this complete nothingness.  Apathy doesn't even describe it, because apathy is usually felt ""towards"" something, so there's still some energy being exerted there.  I'm completely and utterly numb.  I felt this way before for short patches, but this is quite extensive and I don't even care about getting out of it.  This is normal.  This is how I'm supposed to be; this is all I deserve.

I'm so sick of society.  I'm sick of classism.  I'm sick of seeing people who are born without the same opportunities as other people, and yet we claim that everyone is born equal and has the same opportunities in life.  I'm sick of the glorification of people who ""succeed,"" when so much of the time, they actually were given lucky circumstances and are simply standing on the backs of others.  I'm sick of ""money doesn't buy happiness,"" yet money buys freedom and power over your life, and that does in fact lead to happiness.  I'm sick of a capitalist system where a tiny few gorge themselves with wealth they've stolen from the work of others.  I'm tired of being a slave to a system I can't possibly change or move within.  The more I struggle, the more I seem to be ensnared.

I always think about Brave New World, where the number of people is engineered to match the number of various positions available.  No one complains about picking up garbage, because the people picking up garbage don't have the capacity to do or desire more.  Which sounds disturbing, but there's something about that that means those people don't live unfulfilled lives.  Which is so much different from modern life, where most of us are potential Alphas and Betas, but there's only a few of those jobs to go around, so the rest of us get shunted into Gamma and Delta jobs.  Unfulfilled lives.  Broken dreams.  Shattered self-worth.  And the people in the Alpha and Beta jobs look down on us as such.

I grew up in a two-bedroom, tiny little house with two parents and three younger sisters.  My sisters and I all shared a tiny room, so basically I had a bed and no private space.  We all dealt, but for some reason my second-youngest sister has always been extremely aggressive and nasty and my parents have always acquiesced to her demands and failed to discipline her, so our lives were absolute hell.  I loved school because I wasn't at home.  I always did well in school but I wasn't allowed to participate in any activities because it would have required either a) my parents to come pick me up once in a while, or b) me to walk home (half a mile) and even in high school, I wasn't allowed because it wasn't ""safe.""  In suburbia.  WTF.  So when it came time to apply to colleges, I had no way to compete with my peers.  I had grades, but so did other people who also had lots of impressive things on their resumes.  In addition, I had no guidance on applying for colleges, and my parents told me not even to apply for any challenging schools because we could never pay for it anyway.  So I settled for a state school and I shouldn't complain about that, but feeling my squandered potential and wondering what if is something I will struggle with every day for the rest of my life.  I feel like I was lied to and I missed my chance.

Now that I'm married, my family just wants to know when we're having kids.  I don't want kids.  My husband's mom is always ""making sure"" we go to church.  We lie because we don't.  I'm now an avowed atheist and in fact that change probably helped me gain a few extra months out of my life.  I could never tell any of my family this.  I'm very liberal; my Republican family with a few straight-up racists eats me alive anytime anything slightly political comes off in conversation.  In short, any thing about me that is actually ""me"" is not desired or wanted by anyone that is in my life.  I live a lie to survive.

My parents should have gotten a divorce.  My mom is clearly unhappy with how life didn't work out.  My dad lied to her about what they were going to accomplish in life; she stayed home and raised us; he went to work.  He is lazy and has only ever done the bare minimum.  He got a promotion a year or two ago, after over 20 years of work, and after a couple of months he gave it up and went back to work because it was too hard.  He stays at home and watches TV all day.  He has never helped my mom.  He is mean and neglectful to her.  He doesn't/didn't help raise my sisters who are still at home, he doesn't help clean or fix up the house (which is in bad shape right now).  My one sister is a complete bitch (told my mom on a crowded street one time that she's worthless and that's why dad doesn't love her; I wasn't there or I would have punched her in the head), and is completely nasty to everyone, yet she runs the house.  So even though I don't even live at home anymore, there is all this stress because my parents have never been able to manage the little bit of money they have.  They are crazy in debt and justify things like paying for evil sister's birth control and bus passes because she spends all her money on corsets, eating out, and weed.  Not an exaggeration.

So I have all these issues from my past I'm dealing with; self-worth, a bit of neglect, the feeling that I always need to change myself and my behaviors to accommodate others.  I should always bend for others.  If there's ever friction between me and another person, it is my fault, always.

My wardrobe for work is falling apart.  My clothes are so old and worn out and I can't afford to replace them.  I am gaining weight too, and I don't even care, I eat poorly probably as a result of all this (I lost 40 pounds in school but have gained 40 back in the last two years) but what's the point, so I'm now a fat slob wearing worn out clothes to work.  I wear the same 5 shirts and 3 pants every week.  My shoes are worn out.  I work as staff at a very affluent private college and it is embarrassing to go to work.

I live so that I can go to work so I can afford to sleep under a roof, and the only reason I need a roof to sleep under is so I can continue to get up and go to work.  There is nothing more to my life, no further meaning.  It's not going to get better; I've been telling myself this for years.  Things are steadily getting worse, and my options are gone.  This is going to be my life until I die, and I can't take it.  So the only thing I can control is how long I'll be doing this - when my release from it all will be.

I met my husband in college.  We had a pretty good relationship, maybe a little dull, but the only thing we ever really struggled with was communication.  We spent a lot of time working on it, assuming it would eventually get better.  That was four years of that.  We've now been married three years (4 years dating, 3 years marriage) and we're struggling still.  If you can call it struggling; I've officially quit.  I think I've been actually depressed since middle-school; I'm 26 now.  I had a brief glimmer of hope my first two years of college, but then the inevitability of marrying my husband became clear (everyone expected it so it was hard to say no, and when I tried to break up a few times, he acted so damn devastated and I was guilted into taking him back), and so I started to sink again.  I've never been formally diagnosed, but honestly, if this is the good life, life isn't worth living.

I'm going to continue this in the first post because apparently I've written too much.  :(",23,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e3ls3/nothing_really_to_say_no_options_no_point_not/,1289329249

e3s00,depression,[deleted],My problems are petty. My depression is not.,"This depression seems to be my life's only constant. Sleep used to be my solution but not even that brings me comfort anymore. As a matter of fact I now wake up IMMEDIATELY depressed without a single conscious thought. I used to be able to point out what I believed was the cause for my feelings but the depression now affects my life in such a profound manner that I now have no idea what is causing it.

I feel like this depression belongs to a man who has no ambition in life and doesn't know what he wants. On the contrary I am a 24 year old man born with the gift of knowing exactly what I love in life as well as the ambition to follow it through. I just wish I knew why my heart feels like it's drowning in a sea of high melancholy and low suicidal thoughts.

I've attempted suicide in the past and saw how it affected my parents. I didn't post this in SW because I don't feel like I'm in a place where I'd kill myself. But at my lowest, visualizing myself jumping under a train or violently cutting at myself (again) with a knife is a very easy thing to do, and often is the only thing that can provoke any feelings at all.

I wish there was a way I could explain these feelings to the world so that they'd understand. I wish I could tell my parents, who are two provinces away, that I don't call you not because I don't love you but because I am too fucking depressed to talk and I don't want to upset you. You know me far too well and can always tell when I'm pretending to be happy. I wish I could tell my friends that I cancelled another hang out not because I don't care for you but because I became so physically tired from the anxiety that I had to go to sleep. I wish I could tell everyone at work that I fucked up because it takes all my concentration to not have a mental break down in front of everyone. I wish I could tell the teacher at college who seems to think I'm talented that I really don't want to waste my potential.

But I can't. Instead I just put on a fake smile so everyone can pretend that they don't notice I'm out of my mind depressed. Life goes on and I'll get over it, after all. How am I, you ask? Very good thank you! What a nice day outside! That is until I get out of the public eye and into my bedroom. It's here that I cry just soft enough so that my roommates don't hear.

The crying then turns to grieving. But what am I grieving over, you ask? Nobody has died recently if that's what you're thinking. I grieve over all the life I know this depression is sucking out of me. All the opportunities, all the love, all the friends, perhaps even the significant other that that this beast won't allow me to have. Then I sleep, but you know how well that works for me.

 I just don't know what I'm doing anymore, what I'm supposed to be, where I'm supposed to go. Everything is erroding from underneath me and I'm not sure how to fix it. I know that my life isn't as bad as it can be, but it's worse than it's ever been, and no one knows. 

Not a single soul knows the things I feel. The crushing hopelessness that's been plauging me for who knows how long at this point. I feel like I can't do anything right. I used to feel this way, a long, long time ago, and I hoped and prayed it would never come back. 
I think I'm honestly depressed, and I can't tell a single soul. Not that anyone would believe me anyway. I always have a smile on my face and am quick to joke around and make everyone feel at ease. Telling people about my issues seems... impolite. I know that's a stupid way to put it but that's how I feel. I'm the girl who laughs and smiles and is always up for a party or socializing. But I haven't felt like myself in months, maybe since january if not longer. But I can't tell people. I tried a couple of months back, telling my best friend how I felt. But she kept asking me why, and I had no clue. She assumed it was something like boy troubles or family issues, but it wasn't. It still isn't. I don't have problems with boys, if anything I'm just genuinely not interested in dating. My family is great now. Probably better than it's been in a while. But I still feel so down and hopeless.
I couldn't even focus in school, something I used to love. I'm formally withdrawing from my classes in a couple of days. I just can't take it anymore. I have no motivation to read anymore.

e49cd,depression,thrownawayinaflash,Need help understanding and coping.,"Hi everyone, I have been feeling really down lately and I want to know if anyone could give any advice. First off my husband of two years just told me he did not love me anymore. He left our house which we just bought a year ago. I am devistated. We were together for seven years. He had told me that he wanted to have a baby and we were going to start a family this spring. He told me he had been living a lie and was not happy. I only saw that he was acting unhappy the week that he dropped this bomb on me. Other than that he seemed his normal self who was very happy, and from what I thought and could tell, very much in love. We had a great sex life and he swears that he is not cheating on me. He suggested seeing a marriage counselor, but insists that he is not doing it to save the marriage, he wants that to be over. Ever since then (one week ago) I haven't been able to eat much, I break down and cry several times a day. Everytime we try to talk he is cold and distant, he is like a different person in this short of time. He also insists that if he was depressed it was because of living a lie. I am not to the point of suicide but it has crossed my mind fleetingly. How do I cope? This all seems so overwhelming. 

Edit #1- My parents are comming to stay with me tonight until Sunday night. Its good that I won't feel so alone in the house by myself.

e4nk0,depression,minjy,Feeling enormous guilt and stuck in cycles of depression,"I'm 21 years old, and I'm living at home. I graduated from college in May, and I have a very stable job back in my hometown. To save money and also because my parents persuaded me, I'm living at home.

I love my parents. They took great care in raising me to be the best person I could possibly be, and it worked. I'm a lot better off than many of my peers.

BUT my parents still feel the need to manage my life, like they don't trust I can make good decisions. For example, one of these decisions is grad school. Both of my parents pretty much signed me up for grad school against my will, even though I'm not ready for it.

I told them I appreciate the help they're giving me, but I really want to do things by myself and at my own pace. I think they were heartbroken when I said this (and convinced my future was doomed). I absolutely hate the guilt that comes with defying my parents, even though I've been doing it for the past 7 years. 

Another thing, I've lived in this town ALL MY LIFE. I'm tired of it. I desperately want adventure and something new. It depresses me to no end to be back here, and my parents can see it. But instead of encouraging me to try to find something new, they think I'm ungrateful for the good things I have here. And what they say really gets to me sometimes. More stupid guilt. 

I have some friends here and in my college town nearby, and they're what keep me going sometimes. Overall I just feel really down about everything, and it affects my relationship with my family and how I act in social situations. I've become really cold and distant from my family as a response to try to distance myself from their smothering tendencies, and I know it kills them, but I can't bring myself to encourage them any more because that's just not me.

-still living at home with clingy parents

e4nt6,depression,dontbelonghere,I feel like I don't belong anywhere,"25/f/throwaway account

I recently switched jobs to something I thought would be great for me.  Unfortunately, the start-up time took longer than anticipated and I went 2 months without work.  Yesterday was my first day in the correct building with the correct people and it was easily the worst day I've had in a long time.

I've never felt so stupid and inadequate in my life.  I'm a smart person, but I am so unprepared for this job.  I don't understand anything about what's going on or how to do my job.  Everyone insists that I can ask as many questions as I need to, but I'm pretty sure that will be a tip-off that I'm incompetent.  I've been in the workforce for almost 5 years post-college and you would think that I would know something by now.  Nope.  Nothing.

I feel like I'm starting over.  All the other people on my team are somewhat recent grads (only like 1 guy older than me) and they already know waaaay more than I do.  I'm in over my head and I don't know how to fix it.

I'm also involved in a lot of hobbies: musical instrument, photography, sewing, baking, knitting; but I'm not GOOD at any one of them, just mediocre.  I've tried to blog/reddit/tweet/FB about my baked goods, but no one cares.  Most of my stuff isn't as good as all the other blogs out there anyway.

I can't play my instrument as good as anyone, my photos are merely bland, my crafts are nothing spectacular.  I don't have a ""home"" or safe place where people appreciate my contributions (even reddit!).

Not to mention my relationships are shit.  I have almost no friends and things are strained with the 2 friendships I have.  I desperately want things to go well, but I either over- or under-think things and I just end up fucking up.

While I do a lot of things, I don't really feel like I have a ""home"" and I'm not sure why I bother.  I don't fit in at work, I don't fit in IRL, I don't fit in on the internet.

e4o3n,depression,tomorrownevercomes,"Anxious, lonely, depressed, need to be productive. Help?","GF and I are breaking up in a few months. (Staying together for the rest of the lease, together for 4 yrs before). Some problems came up between us which made it clear we both need time apart to figure ourselves out and experience the tantalizing unknown. Growing pains, if you will, that would only hurt worse if attempted later in the relationship. The worst part is we still love each other, and things have been the best lately. Part of that, of course, is the knowledge we're splitting - we've been indulging ourselves with food and entertainment (within budget, outside our personal health goals etc) as a way to have fun and keep in good spirits.

""Time will heal all wounds."" The only problem is, I'm applying to graduate school over the next few months so I don't have spare time. The first deadline is coming up fast and I'm already kind of behind. I've found it harder and harder to make myself work on anything application related. Time goes by in one of these ways:

1. At part time work (envisioning my productivity at home and feeling mostly okay)

2. At home with GF, enjoying self with food and entertainment (occasionally I feel anxious here, but mostly I have fun)

3. Staying up alone late, because I feel restless and anxious, like I have no time during the day so I have to leech as much entertainment out of the night as I can. Habitual attitude from highschool and college.

4. Sleeping during the day because when I'm awake I feel this overwhelming, gnawing anxiety at my throat and doing anything even remotely application/goal related makes me seize up. I end up missing my GF like crazy, and waiting desperately for her to get home so I don't have to feel this shitty and overwhelmed. You might imagine how my thoughts turn when I picture how it's going to be when we've split up and I don't have her. While I still don't feel entirely capable of killing myself, I've been thinking of suicide almost daily, and I feel less and less capable of living as time plummets on.

I tried seeing a therapist, and I suppose I might go back... It just that I felt like I was just slowly, gradually explaining things I'd already thought in depth about, without ever making progress or getting anything out of explaining it. I guess I just wanted someone from a movie to have a scripted relationship with me in which their tough love and pointed questions beautifully counterpoint my verbosity and tendency to over analyze so that I can come to a crystallized understanding of everything and finally make peace with it.

I need to get off my ass and working but I find it almost impossible to struggle past this feeling of anxiety and depression. It doesn't help that the apartment is so quiet. I feel so isolated. I wish there was a chatroom to go to, targeted towards people who want to have a bit of connection with others in an otherwise lonely environment. I don't have the time for something active like reddit - I need to get working. But a chat, I could go to and read, monitor, and join in when I can. I also wish there was a noise I could put on that would fill the apartment up - I find music grating right now, and I don't have cable so I can't just switch on an entertainment channel. I feel anxious and I think having laughter/people sounds in the house would help... But like I said, I also need to be productive, so it couldn't be something I was just going to sit and watch.

I wish I could have said this all more concisely. I hope at least a couple of you made it to the end. For what it's worth, it was a help to write it out. Thanks to everyone who reads and replies to posts like these in communities like these - I know I don't have the energy to even though I see others in situations far more heartbreaking than my own. My deepest, truest sympathies for anyone else who has been feeling rough for whatever amount of time. It isn't easy.

**tl;dr** - GF and I are breaking up. I am turning into an anxious mess at a time when I need to be applying to graduate school. I end up alone in the apartment with time I should be using to apply, and end up not getting anything done because I feel anxious and horrible. Need advice and something to do to feel less anxious and alone so I can relax and begin working.",9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e4o3n/anxious_lonely_depressed_need_to_be_productive/,1289495752

I'm so tired. I'm so sad.

I'm leaving her for what? Because life is stressful. Because we are both people that can't meet the demanding life of society and we put even more stress on each other. This is not right. This is not what it should be like. This is not the world I wanted to live in. Cars, work, bills, budgets, shopping, Christmas, pills, exams, acting normal, living in a small apartment, technology.

I just got a new job which starts next Monday. This whole week, my new manager keeps emailing something like this:

Monday
1) 
This are the things I would need you to be familiar with once you come in:
Facebook API (Single Sign On + Graph API) 
CakePHP framework
Oauth authorization and integration
Google Maps API
Paypal payment integration
You need to be very familiar with PHP and all of its functions.
Unfortunately we don't have time for you to warm up when you come over next week and you will probably need to dive in and start coding from day 2 onwards. As such if you can possible try to create a test application in Cake that can integrate into a sandbox account for paypal and have some Google maps applications inside and maybe a Facebook login? That will at least get you a bit warmed up.

As the service we are launching can have quite a large spike in concurrent users we are also very particular about optimization and database tweaking. Sometimes it makes sense to not have too many database queries and to cache the results and to not normalize a database schema too much. These are all things that we need to take into consideration.

Thursday
2) Do try to see if you can get your hands dirty when you are back as I've got a pile of things that needs your help when you come in and as we need to launch by year end it means a very tight timeline.

Today

Really hope that you've managed to get yourself warmed up with PHP and framewroks as a whole as there will be some pretty deep coding from day 1.

I really don't know what he's really trying to accomplish cos its really stressing me out. I feel so paralyzed that I can't even bring myself to do anything this whole week.

To make it worse, there's this girl which I've been seeing and we've become quite close to each other. Then out of a sudden, she just stopped replying to my text and calls. Tonight I decided to text her again since I really needed someone to talk to. She finally replied and told me that she's sorry but she already has a boyfriend.

I don't know what to do. I don't have much friends and to them, if I try to talk about my problems, they'll just tell me that this is 'pussy-talk'. I can't sleep and my heart is beating fast. I don't know if I can perform at work and the pressure is just tremendous since I really need the money to pay for rent and I also have 400 bucks in debts.

Thing is, I'm confident that I can do those things that is required of me at work, but I really need some time to warm up and these emails he sent me seems counter productive which makes me dread my first day.

Any advice fellow redditors? The new job and losing this girl makes me really paralyzed that the only thing I can do is smoke cigarettes.

e5pba,depression,tphonee,This is me: Unlucky.,"I'm a 22 year old 5th year undergrad struggling with life-long major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, though I've only been diagnosed for about 4 years. I'm on my fifth antidepressant medication and second anti-anxiety medication, I take sleeping pills every night, and I pretty much contemplate suicide every waking moment.

I assume the mental health issues stem from my family life/childhood: My alcoholic father is verbally abusive and although has never once physically abused me, I've grown up with a severely fractured personal foundation, hence why I refer to my problems as life-long. I started contemplating suicide at 12 but I somehow powered through it because I thought it was normal to feel like I did and I didn't want to be the girl that pussied out because I couldn't handle the pre-teen/teen angst everyone else was going through (or so I thought).

I became a class clown, performed in theater, made excellent grades, and worked late hours as hard as I could because time at work meant more time away from home. All of my supervisors and adult friends seemed to love me because I'm such a hard-worker, and I'm fairly certain that's what stemmed all the ill-feelings from my peers. Even now, as much as I love my program at school, I'm so intimidated by my peers and feel so ostracized that I don't go to class, but I still go to work, where I get that much needed gratification. 

I used to seek help from my professors and mentors and bosses, I used to confide in them, until I realized it garnished more hatred and cruel intentions from my peers. So, I've tried to make it on my own. I'm a poor college student, who might as well be orphaned following my father's kicking me out for petty ""offenses"", so I tried my luck at the Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS) at my campus's Health Center. It went well for about 6 months: I received psychiatric care, and was given medication, and also saw a psychologist, for free through a grant funded by parents and families of mental health patients. After six months, they tried to refer me out to the community, which is understandable, and probably more welcome if I had been informed of this before I started attending CAPS. So, after establishing a close relationship with my therapist and psychiatrist, I was being rejected from the program because I was recognized as a patient that needed ""long term care"", which CAPS was not suited to provide.

I stopped seeing anyone for a while until the insane depression, suicidal thoughts, severe irritability and apathy came back. I started at a local sliding-scale clinic, and due to my income, I was again able to reap these services for free. Being a low-income focused clinic, the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick frequented there, most of them uneducated and battling with substance abuse along with mental health issues. Being white and above average in attractiveness, I felt compelled to dress in baggier clothing and hide my face so as to avoid harassment from the fellow clients at this clinic. The clinic also isn't well-funded, so the care I receive is pretty sub-standard, but I still get my medication and psychological therapy. Until after another six months or so, I was told I would be assigned to a new therapist because my current one had finished her rotation. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this problem, but I have severe trust issues, especially with therapists, and once I develop a good relationship with one, I get extremely insecure about my ""old"" therapist and my ""new"" therapist trading notes, talking about me, then being expected to pick up where I left off with a stranger. I then stopped seeing a therapist there.

My financial situation got a little better, so I started seeing a new therapist, but continued to receive medicinal help at the low-income clinic. $50/week for my new therapist forced me to live paycheck to paycheck, but I enjoyed seeing him and felt like it had to be helping; the money I spent said it had to. Job changes and/or school changes put me in a position where I was unable to see my therapist, and I spiraled into a very low, severe depression. I went to CAPS after-hours emergency care, and saw the supervisor of the program. He asked all the right questions (""Are you suicidal?""; Do you have a plan?""; etc.) but never gave me a response to any of what I thought were my desperate please for help (""Yes, I'm suicidal""; ""I'd drive my car into incoming traffic""; etc.). He photocopies pages of the phonebook under ""Psychology"", told me to pick one and call them tomorrow so that I could seek extended psychological care, and sent me on my way. I drove there. I had just explained to him that I was suicidal and that my suicide plan involved my car, and he just sent me home. I was so absolutely flabbergasted, I drove home (although I don't remember the drive), and once I settled back into my severe depression, I had a friend take me to the ER, where I was checked into a crisis center for a week. It was through the same low-income clinic I sought psychiatric care from, and the care was comparable. I received a $3000 bill later for ONLY the ER visit, and was sent to collections for the $700 ""doctor's exam"" of it because, of course, they're billed separately. 

To summarize the last year: My best friend of ten years completely wrote me out of his life after a few four-month or so hiatuses when he ""couldn't listen to my problems"". Absolutely broke my heart, which is another flaw of mine, I suppose: I put absolutely everything I have into every relationship because I cherish those who find me worthy of friendship, a relationship, whatever. That's all I have to be grateful for, really.
My landlord stiffed me on $500 worth of deposits, allowed new tenants to move into the house I was living in BEFORE my lease was up, and after filing a small claims suit, it comes back to me, undelivered, because the address he had written in my lease was bogus. I have no way of finding him, and the immature little prick that he is won't answer my phone calls or address me in a professional manner.
My mentor, guardian angel, and wonderful soul that let me move into her home after my father kicked me out of his (my mother was against that decision), and taught me how a human being should be treated, passed away in February. I miss her so, so, so incredibly much, and it's so difficult to find solace in my nonexistent or non-relatable clutch of friends.
I made a failed suicide attempt in August. I don't think I should expand on this.

I wish I could delve more into my unluckiness, but I'm afraid no one wants to read it and I'm already depressed thinking about my life and just want to reach out for help. I can't afford therapy anymore. I don't have friends that even remotely understand what depression is. I absolutely hate my life and am struggling to figure out what is it I'm here for. It seems I've destroyed two relationships last night, though unintentionally, and I've found myself at the bottom of the barrel because of it. I'm extremely ill, I can't eat for fear of throwing up because I'm so distressed; I can't relax. I have never wanted more than to just go to sleep and not have to wake up feeling like this anymore.

e5tlq,depression,throwaway9183,My story...,"Uh, hi. I never really thought I would do this, but I guess this has gotten to be too much for me to handle, so I'm going to give reddit a shot before I give up.

A little history: 
In February I started hearing voices telling me to hurt myself. I got close to suicide pretty regularly. Finally, at the end of February, the only person who knew convinced me to talk to someone. I talked to the counselor at school. I told him exactly what was going on, not really knowing what to expect. Well before I knew it he mumbled something about command hallucinations, or something, and then I was riding in a cop car to the hospital, where I spent the next 5 days.  That began the downward spiral that's been my life since then.

First off, the psych ward at the hospital was a miserable place. I don't want to go into too much detail (since that's not really the point of this post), but basically I didn't eat a single meal, and barely slept. I got admitted on a Friday night, so I couldn't even plead my case to get out until Monday. I just had to deal with it for the weekend. And then when I finally could talk to someone on Monday they said they needed a few days for processing, or something.

When I got out of there I had to see a doctor where I lived (and went to school). She kept me on the medication they put me on at the hospital, and gave me some other ones on top of it. The voices went away, but I never really felt better.

Now, I was taking a break from school to work for 8 months. I had job offers in some really cool places, but instead moved home to work in my hometown and live with my parents in May. This made things better for them, but worse for me. I hate my hometown - just hate it. I switched doctors (obviously, so I would see one closer to home) and the medication I was on got switched around a little bit. I hated being on medication so much that I pretended I was doing better, even though I wasn't. One day I told my doctor that if she wasn't going to take me off my medication, I was going to do it without her, because there was no way I was moving back to school while still on anything. She realized she would rather I do it under her watch than just go off of everything, so she agreed to take me off fairly quick, at least in her point of view. I thought it was still painfully slow.

Now I'm off everything, as of the last couple of nights. I never got better. Besides the voices, I'm back to where I was. They might come back, I'm not really sure. I never got an explanation of why they were there in the first place.  I regularly think of suicide and hurting myself.

My parents think I'm doing better. My boyfriend knows I'm not. He thinks I should talk to another doctor, but I hate psychiatrists. I clearly don't want to talk to people I know about what's going on, so why would I want to talk to a stranger about it? They're just paid to sit there. I'm not going to pay someone to sit there and listen to me talk. I didn't really grow up in an environment where everyone talks about how they're feeling all the time, so I'm not very good at it... Plus I know if I did talk to a doctor about it, I'd be put on medication, which I hate. I don't like the idea of being on something that messes with how I think. I feel like I'm not me anymore. And if I am completely honest about how I just don't see a point in going on, I don't see what will stop them from sending me back to the hospital. And I refuse to end up back there.

I told him that I can fix this on my own. That it's all mental, and I just need to find the strength to deal with it. But I'm giving myself a time limit of a week or two. If I get to that point and I still feel the same, I'm just going to give up altogether. Since we both use reddit regularly he suggested I post here and see what happens. I don't really know what I'm expecting, but I've seen some other posts on here get good feedback, so I guess it's worth a shot. So, anyone got any ideas, besides therapy and/or medication?",11,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e5tlq/my_story/,1289704268

They told me I'm the only friend they have talked to right after cutting, and has confided a lot with me that no one else knows. 

I still need your help. I was just wondering from other depressed people, what can your friends to do help you?? My friend goes to counseling, has tried taking drugs before to help (trying new ones recently), and is overall pretty open with their depression and has accepted it well. 

Sometimes I wonder if they really say what will help them though. My friend is incredibly selfless and would not want to put me in a weird situation or anything. So, I want to know from a third party (you) what else can I do to help my friend?? I hang out with them anytime they feel especially depressed, that seems to be just about all they've said I can do to help. 

Can I do anything else?? What would you want your friends to do??

e5xri,depression,deltorro20,Wonderfull opportunities. Lack of will to live.,"I don't know how to write it, but i need another chance of relief...
It has all started when my father died (I was about to turn 12, he commited suicide, to be more accurate). From what my mother has told me, he always had mental problems. I was always a shy boy, the kind that would play alone with his toys and live in his own world. I have shut the doors to my room, and let the computer addiction drain the pain of the loss. The internet was with me for another 3-4 years, it felt so good, the addiction took complete control of me to the point that it was the only thing on my mind. I wasn't going out anywhere for those years, and I say ANYWHERE(except school), 24/7 in front of the god damn monitor in my room, only going out to pee. When I finally realized of my social disabilities I tried to fix them by drinking. I was going out with people only to drink, it was the only chance for me to socialize, since alcohol was always way more attractive than people which I thought were fake lying bastards in my point of view. Partying and having fun was always foreign to me, I was never able to have a normal conversation with people since I don't know anything. I don't have any kind of general knowledge that all of them had and have. I was trying to be excessive with alcohol, but it turned out it's not so fun when you're depressed and like everything in my life, it got boring and pointless. Apathy was leading my life, nothing gave me any happiness, I was just laying there and crying every night like a vegetable. In the meantime I've met (she had met me, to be more exact...) a wonderful girl, the most beatuiful flower that I have seen to date. I always thought of her as an angel that has come to guard me from the bullshit of the world. Very bright, intelligent, 120% into life, the girl that would go to a bar by herself and have fun. With a life knowledge that I will ever have. She has loved me for 3 years, but I was so stubborn and resistant to any kind of close contact that she couldn't get to me. Finally we are together for almost a year now, I've gone through my fobias to the point were I could do it... and now we're apart, gone to college to different cities... I have been seeing a psychologist about a year ago, that perscribed me pills that somehow stopped me from crying. But the thoughts have stayed, I feel like a freak everywhere I go, I'm afraid of going literally anywhere, the only thing I enjoy right now is sleep and taking a crap. I see my girl like every 2-3 weeks, which has made it a little pointless to me right now. I can't have normal conversations with people, I stay at home all the time, like I've always did. Now the point is that sociolizing wouldn't be a problem if only I were at least 1% intelligent or had any interests. But I don't, it takes time till I get a joke, or a problem, I think slowly and can't even eat, I lose wieght so how am I suppose to even study?
The only thing that is stopping me from doing harm to myself is harming my mother... She has lost her father and her husband in the same way. I always had what I wanted, money has never been a problem. I'm a spoilt kid, with neverending fear of everything that surrounds me. I would read books, I would study, I would do ANYTHING but what's the point? I can't remember anything I've watched for the past years or anything I've read, I don't concentrate on anything. Never done anything in my life, now I wake up everyday and think of a way to cut the pain, but I can't cause I would put my mother in and endless whirl of misery. But I don't want to live... I was about to put this in SW but i read it and thought that it only looks like some guys is whining about his life, but doesn't have actual problems... well I can't even describe how I feel but I'm going to put it here anyway. I'm 19 and don't want to live, the depression is eating me since I can remember.

e603e,depression,oepoeht,"Never thought I'd do this, but here I am","(If you think this is a rant about girl problems, it's not, please read onwards)

I'm turning 18 next month, realizing I've never had sex, nor have I made out with a girl ever. I have plenty of friends, including girl ones, and I've had tons of opportunities (one sitting in my lap and actually telling me she's interested), I don't know what the hell is wrong with me

When I was about 13 years old I fell in love with a girl who didn't like me back (Don't worry, it's not going to turn into a teenage sad about girls thread), and I completely embarassed myself with teen depression, acting like a complete retard, seeking sympathy all over the place. As I grew out of it, I realized how fucking stupid I was, and ever since I've been so reluctant to share whatever problems I have that it's just been bottling up the last 5 years. I even have some really close friends who've shared stuff like this with me, but I can't tell them I feel bad.

It's really hard to cope with all this on my own and I feel like the biggest burden when I do it. I put on a charade every day at school, at parties etc, I come home, I kill time at the computer reluctant to go to school the next day, but I still do. My grades are getting worse and worse, I can barely keep up in Physics and Math at all now, I don't even have anything to do at home, I just sit here bored, listening to music and browsing reddit.

I also like to think a lot about things, and that on its own makes it really hard to see things seriously. I'm really interested in astronomy, biology, religion 8well, I'm an atheist, but you get it) and physics (which doesn't require calculations at my interest level), and know close to what's possible to know about the universe. I tend to space out completely, and when pondering the extreme size of the universe, the extreme minisculity of atoms, the humongous void that is space and quantum physics I just feel so insignificant.

I also tend to space out when I think about time, how it's flowing right at this second and I can't stop it. I honestly think I'm going insane for real sometimes, and I can't make myself tell anyone. My parents love me, and I know I could tell them, but I would be such a grave disappointment to them, my mom would probably cry and all, I can't handle to tell them that, thinking about going to some kind of psychiatrist when I move out.

Anyways, I jsut wanted to share this anonymously with someone, I'd love input, and AMA if you want.

TL;DR I was a whining moron when I was a kid which led to bottling up feelings later in life, disappointed in myself and everything, cynical as hell, think I'm going actually insane with all the crazy thoughts swirling around in my head.",14,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e603e/never_thought_id_do_this_but_here_i_am/,1289759803
e61pn,depression,giant_mushy_friend,"Tips from a stranger on Omegle; Also, a request to find an old comment here explaining how to really help depressed people","A lot of thanks are hereby sent to the stranger on Omegle, a student of psychology, who tried a lot to help me out of my depression and gave a few useful suggestions too. Some of the things he suggested were:    
* Running every day for about half an hour, taking breaks of jogging when necessary - the increased cardiac rate will supposedly help the body generate happy chemicals and help set a positive mood    
* Taking meals six times a day instead of the usual three or so    
* Setting a fixed sleep schedule and sticking to it as much as possible
     
I haven't tried these yet, but have a feeling at least the first one will surely help. The third one will also be of help, but it isn't very much under my control - when depression strikes, it's not easy to put myself to sleep, no matter what I try. 

Now, unfortunately, he did not have a very good understanding of the basics of depression, especially for a psychology major (who, in his own words, had ""studied"" and ""understood"" depression). He kept telling me how ""grateful"" I should be even to be alive, how I have eyes to read this and even that is a great thing, blah blah. When I said those things don't mean shit when my basic instinct to live has been sapped out, he just said I just lacked gratitude. He also kept saying depression is the choice people make and I can just as easily choose out of it. And of course, the usual ""snap out of it"" and think positively stuff.     

The fact that such misconceptions about depression exist even among psychology majors was quite disheartening to me. I then remembered reading a good explanation of how depression works here on Reddit a few days ago (which I wanted to bestof, but forgot. Damn me!). I searched for it but couldn't remember anything except that it was a comment on a post here at r/depression (or much less probably, on r/suicidewatch), and it was a direct reply to what was the first comment under the ""best"" sorting. I realize this isn't a lot of details, but in case you know which comment I mean, please provide a link. It would be very useful to send to others with such misconceptions. It very eloquently described how, for people in depression, failure and doom *are* the reality, and to help them (us!) you can't start by denying it, but have to work gradually up from there. It was much better put than that though.

I've always had social anxiety. I'm not depressed, but I typically get very uncomfortable in situations like parties. I realize this is not at all uncommon, but it's caused me to seriously overindulge on drinking too many times. But last night I tried xanax for the first time (illegally, given to me by a friend who take it before drinking) before going to a party. Once it kicked in, I realized its effects are exactly what I needed, and proceeded to have a great time without drinking at all.

I feel like I have a legitimate need to be prescribed to it, however I would probably only take it on the weekends for parties and the like, and I feel like that's basically recreational use. To be clear, it would be a substitute for drinking/other drugs. I guess my question is would doctors see that as recreational use?

I've never been on any medications and have gotten by just fine. I have friends and I get out of the house on weekends (I don't think I need to see a therapist about anything), but xanax allows me to overcome my social anxiety and actually enjoy myself socializing and meeting new people.

I have a decent job as a civil servant and make an ok salary working as a computer programmer.  But I don't consider myself that good at what I do.  I know enough to get by where I am, so I guess that's good enough.
I have my own house and vehicle (no car payment), and my own dog.  With a few positive changes things could be alright for me.

Now this is where the depressing stuff starts....  I will probably need to include a TLDR somewhere near the bottom.  I have always felt like an outsider.  It has been this way for about as long as I can remember.  Even as a young child I can still remember a specific moment as myself on the outside of the group looking in.  I've always found it extremely hard to make friends and socialize with other people.  This probably comes from being an only child.  I feel like this factor along with not having a close knit family has been the catalyst for what I am today.

In a way it seems like I'm blaming my parents, which I really don't want to do.  My parents got divorced when I was 8 years old.  I know most of the blame rests firmly on myself for the decisions I've made.  It just seems like it didn't have to be this hard.  

We all need our own support system to get by because life certainly isn't easy.  This seems to be notably absent in my life.  As of right now I count myself having zero friends.  That's right absolutely none.  No girlfriend nothing.  Of course I get along well enough with the guys at work, but most of them have families/kids/wifes/lives etc.  We don't really do anything outside of work.  Sad note:  Since living in my new house for over year, only one person has been over that I know and used to consider a friend.

I never seem to go anywhere any more.  It would be nice to be able to go to a friend's house or something... anything really.  Sometimes I feel like I just have to get out or I will go crazy, but there just doesn't seem to be any where to go :/  So  I probably just end up sitting here browsing the net killing time till the next fruitless day.  Reddit's really good for that.

My life consists of going to work during the week for 8 hours coming home maybe play some video games, eat, browse reddit, walk my dog and then sleep.  During the weekend it's pretty much the same.  I don't really even get any enjoyment out of video games any more either.  The weekend holds no special meaning for me and is actually even more depressing than the regular week since I know other people are out having fun.

I've gotten really good at just kind of sitting and staring into space.  I should probably include that in my Okcupid profile.... or maybe not.  Sometimes I just sleep to pass the time.  You can't feel depressed when you're asleep, but then eventually I wake up and it starts all over again.  I've probably been depressed my whole life, but only majorly so for the past 3 years.  

I've been to a counselor which didn't really help.  It actually made me more depressed going and we eventually parted ways since she didn't think it was helping me.  I haven't been on antidepressants either, since I tried one and the side effects were a major bitch much noticeably the nausea which is already a big enough deal to me without even taking the medication.

I've always had sort of a queasy stomach.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux a long time ago, but I don't think that's quite accurate.  I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with me.  A lot of it is probably nerves/anxiety about all the bullshit in my life.  But maybe there is something that could help me who knows....  I hate medication and try to avoit it.  You can see it's been doing me a lot of good.

So I've avoided counseling/therapy, medication, and philanthropy;  these seem to be the 3 main things people suggest to get out of depression.  I can't really find anything good I want to do for other people.  I tried looking a while back, but my indecision eventually got the better of me.  

For a long time I've been caught up with the idea of having a girlfriend and actually had a couple but they just didn't seem to be the ""one"".  My anxiety usually kills most of the chances I have to strike up conversation with anyone new.  I stopped trying long ago, when my inability to act made me feel physically and mentally like complete shit.  

There have been a few people in my life which I thought that I really connected with but for some reason or other things just weren't meant to be.  One of them I tried to remain friends with, switching back and forth from trying to be friends with to pushing away....  I will say boyfriends were the root cause of failure in two cases.  

In the past year I've pushed two people away when I just couldn't take it any more.  They just didn't seem to be good friends.... Then others just leave of their own accord.  I don't really believe in having friends that you don't regularly see or talk to and/or do things with.  That just seems fucking pointless to me.  I'm not one for building up the huge ass list of facebook friends. 

I've tried the online dating thing in the past with limited success, but now that is just another thing that doesn't seem possible for me.  I feel like some kind of post traumatic stress disorder veteran now when it comes to things like that. I'm shell shocked and can't even begin to type a message or revise my profiles.   I can't type messages with the idea nagging in mind at every word that what I type will be something to ultimately lead to failure.  You see I've tried so many times in the past and now all the things that don't work seem to leave nothing left.

It just makes me sad now to even browse other profiles.  There seem to be genuinely wonderful people out there that I think I would get along great with up until I never hear anything back from them and am ignored forever.  So now like everything else I don't even try.  I like to believe that the world and people are genuinely good, but I continue to be proven otherwise.

Back when I was in my early college days I had a much easier time at just writing whatever the fuck I wanted in my profile and messages.  Because back then I wasn't as ""scarred"" as I am now.  The world of online dating was a clean slate as far as I was concerned.  Back then I could be that cool guitar playing guy that didn't about anything (words purposely left out).  So I was able to meet a few people and maybe just chat online.... But at least it was something and got me by.

Well I feel like I've typed enough for now... At least something to get me started.  Plus I need to go walk my dog.  I may type some more when I get back.

TLDR;  28 year old male only child shell shocked from cruel world looking for other like minded redditors to build some kind of support system and get back into the world.  It's a plus if you're around the same age as me and are up for chatting online.  However, any one is welcome.  Also, AMA.  I'll be back in a little while.  

Sorry if my writing is a little too stream of conscientiousness... in other words jumping all over the fucking place. ",13,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6639/so_i_guess_its_finally_time_i_told_my_story/,1289789177
e6690,depression,dnemer,I want to cry but I cannot,"For the past few months I have been feeling numb.  I have been clinically depressed for longer but lately I am feeling numb.  I am in a constant state of mellowness or occasionally anxiety prone sadness.  Yet I cannot really get myself to cry.  I tried watching sad movies, reading sad stories, thinking about sad thoughts, thinking about dying, thinking about sad things happening in world.  But I cannot cry.  I want to cry because I am in this constant state of no feeling, and all I really want to feel those feelings again. the beauty of crying is that it is rejuvenating and it clears your heart and the mind.  It is a comfort, and there is reason that people need to cry sometimes.  However, I am having a hard time to feel something of that emotional strength.   there are other feelings that I wish to feel again too.  But I miss crying the most.  A good cry really is what I need now.  If I could pick anything I would want to cry most over, it  would be something that is heart warming, like the first 10 minutes of the movie UP, type of feeling that would make you cry.  I want to feel that so very much. please would you help me?",7,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6690/i_want_to_cry_but_i_cannot/,1289789850

I'm 21, I have no job, no money, I live with my parents, I dropped out of college, I rarely see the few friends that I do have and I feel like I'm stuck.  

When I lost my job four months ago, I had a little bit of money saved up, so I wasn't worried about it at the time, but now my bank account is over drawn.  I have no idea what to do about that.  I've put in several applications at local stores, and haven't gotten any calls back.  I have no idea what to do for employment.  I had an idea about two months ago, that I'd join the Army.  I thought that they'd be able to take me in, and I'd have something to work for and something to be proud of.  They told me I'm about 15 pounds over weight, and I wouldn't be able to go anywhere until I lost that.  I've been trying to lose the weight, since that seems like the only avenue worth going down at this point, but between my lack of knowledge about being physically fit, my mom continuing to feed me unhealthy food (and I'm a total momma's boy. That doesn't really help with the self esteem, either), and my lack of motivation, that's not going anywhere either.  College, at this point isn't much of an option.  Since I've dropped too many classes, my GPA is too low to apply for any assistance, and I think putting myself in debt is a pretty bad idea at this point.  I have a few friends, but I don't see them much.  They like to go out and drink, and have a good time when they're not at work.  That's all well and good, but drinking for me just leads to self loathing, and nobody likes to be around me.

So if you've made it this far, Reddit, wat do?  I know my situation doesn't sound that bad, and I realize that.  I hate that I feel so down about myself.  There are so many people that are so much worse off, so why should I have the right to complain about my situation?",17,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6agu/can_you_guys_help_me_raise_my_self_esteem/,1289810589
e6ak5,depression,pfffffftlife,What do I do when the society around me is the cause of my feeling like shit?,"Recently, I've become extremely depressed reading up on politics and the current state of the U.S.  And I can't stop reading up on it either, because I hope each day that at least some good news comes, but it never does.  Don't ask, don't tell isn't being repealed; net neutrality, the one bastion of free speech left, is under threat; politics has become so partisan that it's more about proving the other side wrong than, say, finding the best solution for creating new jobs and improving the economy.  As a result (more for the last point), we're going to crash and burn and bring the rest of the world down with us, and there's nothing I can see realistically happening that would stop it.

I mean, how am I supposed to stay optimistic about life when the people in charge are so fucking retarded, and nothing significant is getting done?  Am I supposed to just ignore it and wait for the inevitable to happen?  I would join a political movement, but I can't see any actually make a difference.  Even the Tea Party, who I already disagree with on so many levels, are being hijacked by the same kind of people they're protesting against.

I've always tried to remain optimistic, but what am I supposed to do when the world around me isn't giving me any rational reasons to?  I realize this might seem shallow compared to other users' run ins with depression, but this has been affecting me a lot lately, and I don't know what to do.

It seems trivial, nothing seems to go my way, and it's like a day out of the year when you're reminded how little you matter to people--one day out of the year when people are forced to be nice to you, to do things for you, etc etc.

I really haven't enjoyed my birthdays since I was about 11. My family didn't have much, we were living in a hotel at the time (where my dad was a chef), barely getting by, and the only thing I wanted was a Gameboy with a few games (which I knew we couldn't afford). Long story short, that's what my parents got--I was in tears because I was so happy. I sat there and played it all night in the hotel lobby (I haven't had a birthday party with kids my age since about age 8, which may be a factor in me disliking my birthday).

I had a mental breakdown last year when I turned 21..it was like a midlife crisis for me. I was ashamed of myself because I hadn't accomplished anything compared to others my age.

I'm also having deeply depressing thoughts today, and I don't know how to get rid of them. It's been the worst fucking birthday I've had so far, and it's not even halfway over.

e6lih,depression,yuppp,Hi Reddit. Can I tell you a secret?,"I'm depressed. Really depressed.

I'm 21 years old, and since the beginning of middle school I've felt this way to some degree. None of my friends or my family suspect I'm anything other than happy.

I've lived a pretty privileged life. My family is upper/middle class. We live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood in a nice little city, surrounded by nice people. 

I go to a prestigious University that I don't feel like I deserve to be in. I got in largely because my father works here, and my brother graduated with honors. I am not doing poorly, but I seriously do not feel as though I'm learning anything at all. All I do is coast through classes putting forth whatever the bare minimum effort required to get a B of some sort is (usually very little effort). Every morning I wake up disgusted in myself. I'm wasting around $50,000 of my parents money every year so that I can dick around in classes easier than I should be taking and get blackout drunk off of four lokos 3 days a week. 

I'm personable, athletic, friendly, nice, and a virgin. I have horrendous taste in women. The last 3 crushes I've had have had boyfriends. One of them fucked my best friend in the room next to me while I tried to fall asleep. My current crush is dating someone that told her she's not worth his time. I haven't had a girlfriend in my entire life. Sometimes I lie in bed for hours imagining what it would be like to share it with someone I love.

The truth is I'm absolutely terrified of rejection. Terrified that I'll take a really advanced class, try really hard, and do poorly. Terrified that I'll finally get the courage to tell Anna(name changed, current crush) that she should dump her tool of a boyfriend and go out with me instead and be told she just wants to be friends.

I know that I have no reason to feel the way I do. My life really isn't that bad. I'm lonely, but so are lots of people. My family is very stable, my parents love me, I have good friends who look out for me. I'm smart, athletic, and attend one of the best schools in the country. All of these things just make me feel even worse, because despite them all I don't want to exist anymore. I wistfully daydream of masked bandits charging into lecture, and heroically restraining them at the cost of my own life. Or pushing a little girl to safety and being obliterated by the train that would have killed her. Or just falling and breaking my neck. 

Sorry for rambling. I honestly don't know what the purpose of this post is. Maybe I thought writing would make me feel better about myself.",19,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6lih/hi_reddit_can_i_tell_you_a_secret/,1289857396
e6m1b,depression,Zombification,I Think I need some more help assessing my mental health,"I'm sorry this is so long.

After reading reading a lot of posts and seeing such positive feed back I figured it was due time I opened up to any redditor who will listen and try to understand what I've been dealing with...

It started when I was around 15-16, I was at my best friends'(of at the time just about 14 years or so) house I used to go there a lot growing up, it was her, her dad, and I all just relaxing and playing mario kart on her N64 in her basement innocent enough right? My friend Pat decided to go grab some drinks from upstairs, so she ran off to get those while I stayed downstairs with her dad, we made small talk and joked a little before he started complimenting me on my body telling me I ""grew up beautifully"" while caressing my inner thighs lightly running his fingers over my 'no mans land' I was needless to say extremely creeped out, but panicked and wasn't sure exactly what to do, so I got up told my friend I was sick and walked out. I never had a good relationship with either of my parents so I just tried really hard to repress the memory but I found it only made things worse for me, I began having trouble sleeping and when I did sleep I started having vivid nightmares about what had happened. I became depressed and angry at the world. I stopped going to classes because I just felt like it was pointless I hated everything I was learning because I felt like it wasn't going to help me.
I started hiding in the girls bathroom because I had nowhere to go during school hours. 

After maybe a week or so of this I was found by a teacher an taken to my counselor. He began asking me why I wasn't going to class to which I responded with ""I hate this stupid place.."" constantly fiddling with my fingers and looking down. It was true too I hated that place.. with such passion. He didn't think much of it at the time and told me what I had to do to avoid expulsion. It made me angry but I ended up going back to my classes and doing my work. But without the motivation or drive to do things it was somewhat pointless for me to even try. I was only good at English because I liked writing poetry, it was my way of venting my way of secretly writing about everything I was feeling. 

When I turned 16 I met a guy at a metal show at a local venue in my town. We'll call him Ryan.. he was 25 at the time, before him I was never really interested in anyone and kept to myself a lot ( I barely had any girl friends, let alone boy friends) Ryan was different and I learned that more and more as we became closer and hung out more. He had so many similarities to myself and I was sure he would understand what I was going through, But before I had the chance to tell him about what had happened to me in the past he sent me an email saying that he should have never gotten involved with me and told me I was a mistake. Needless to say I was shattered.. I thought I had finally found someone to expressed my pain to and possibly get some help. But just because he was gone didn't mean the mutual friends we made together were as well. I knew a lot of bad people at this point in my life. Lots of drug dealers and a few dudes in gangs, these were the people who introduced me to cocaine. They said that it would make all the pain I felt go away. Being stupid and desperate I began snorting, the rush I was getting was like nothing I had ever felt before. I started to figure ""eh whatever.. no ones gonna care if I live or die"" so I continued snorting cocaine for about a year, but after I decided it was finally time to lay off the coke, I began to feel something.. I can't describe it in any other word but dead. Emotionally dead. I couldn't feel anything and it scared the hell out of me. I wasn't sure what was happening but I knew I wanted to feel something again. I waited a few weeks hoping that this painful nothingness would pass while trying to deal with all the negativity going on in my life. Nothing happened if anything I felt worse about my life. So I began take copious amounts of over the counter drugs hoping to OD and end all the numbness. I still remember walking to my counselors office all fucked up after taking 19 or so extra strength benadryll and pretty much told him what was going on. Thats when they finally got me some help.. some half ass'd help but help none the less in the form of a suicide watch counselor that my school paid for for me. I began seeing my new counselor every week for an hour talking about myself but not really getting any advice about what I should do to get better Instead my counselor thought it would be best to call my mother and tell her I was pretty much just crazy. I get home from school and both my mom and dad are there, they sit me down in our parlor and tell me how disappointed they are that I'm putting them through this... No words of comfort, no ""we'll get you any kind of help you need"".. they sat me there and said ""why are you putting us through this? we're so disappointed in you"" as if this was my fault. Like I asked to be put through this self agony everyday. I didn't know what to say so I just got up and went to my room. Hearing their words only made me feel worse and more empty and numb inside, and at this point all I wanted was pain, so I began abusing myself with one of my old baseball bats along with continuing my over the counter drug binging(just not as often nor as much) I beat the hell out of myself to feel alive then I would take benadryll to fall asleep and feel nothing. My endless loop. I did this until I was about 18.. I managed to graduate high school after I decided that maybe if I finish and impress my parents everything would get better, but at this point my family was so distant from each other it went unnoticed, in fact they didn't even come to my graduation ceremony, just picked me up afterwards. 

After high school was when I started dating my first serious boyfriend a 19 year old we'll call Roach. The first few months of our relationship were great I felt truly happy like I had everything I needed but I guess i should have known better. 6 months into our relationship I found he was cheating on me.. With 6 different girls. When I found out I was in such shock and I tried really hard to convince myself it wasn't true but the evidence I was presented said otherwise... I stayed anyway for another 4 months before I realized that staying was making me seem like a psycho girlfriend because i never trusted a word he said and all his friends honestly thought I was just nuts. I ended it with him and began getting harassed by his family and friends because of what he did to me. They began calling me names like a slut, a whore, nigger, skank, you know all those things people will say to you to try and break your spirit. I tried to not let it bother me and for awhile it was working but the more time went on the more i slowly convinced myself that I had ruined my relationship and that it was my fault he started cheating. 

After all that I found I hated being alone and had to think of what I can do to fix this new void in my chest, I became very promiscuous and would meet guys in various ways to feel something emotionally. I didn't care about anything, I just wanted that pleasure of feeling desired again. After a few months of doing this and living on my own after being told by my mother I'm not welcome at home anymore I was running out of money and needed to pay rent.. I'm sure you all know where this is going... I began selling my body while actively looking for a job so I could pay my rent and my bills. At first I thought I could do it because the money was pretty decent and I could pay for my rent and everything else and still have enough left over to by myself a little something. But the more men I met the harder it became considering that most of the men I met were aged from between 35 and 55. I'm out of this business now and am happy to be free but because of it I have developed a severe case of PTSD and what I'm told is mania. I can no longer look people directly in the eye for more then a second without feeling like they're laughing at me or know about what I've been going through in the past. It's killing me inside and I have been having suicidal thoughts again, my mind tells me its time to give up and let go of life. I'll spend days on my own debating whether or not today will be the day I end it all. I know mentally I need help putting the pieces of my life back together but the depression I've been dealing with is preventing me from seeking it. Something inside me just tells me I'd be better off dead. 



I'm probably missing a ton of details, and frankly I don't even know if it all makes sense I just wrote it as I remember it, so please any advice would be great.

e6mdw,depression,TheWorldisTough,How did I get here?,"Regular Redditor. Alt account. Twenty year old male.

In August everything was fine. I had a girlfriend, a car and a job waiting for me in the big city. I packed up and moved out of state to follow my dream and start my career.

Here I sit. No job, no car, no girlfriend, no food. I feel completely alone here. Things starting getting rough quickly after I moved away. Soon after I got to this city the job I had fell through. I want to work in a field that is ridiculously hard to get into, so this job falling through was a huge blow. 

So, I decided to get a part time job. I was working at a cafe in town and things were okay. I was making enough money to pay my rent and still had time to search for a job in my field. But then my car broke down. To have the job I want to have, you pretty much need a car, so I put my career on hold and continued to work at the cafe full time until I could fix my car.

Somewhere along the way, the girl I was with decided she didn't want to come be with me, and instead is moving to another city, even further away. The least of my problems now, but it's still hard not having her to at least talk to.

After two weeks of working at this cafe, I come into work one day and see that everything is gone, and there are people there changing the locks. (the cafe was inside of a hotel. The man running the cafe was renting the location from the man that owned the hotel). I asked somebody at the hotel what was going on and they said that Bill (cafe manager) owed the hotel owner money and was not paying up. Also, Bill skipped town and nobody in this city has heard or seen from him in weeks. He's not returning any of my calls, texts or emails. He still owes me money.

What makes the problem worse is that I had put my car in the shop a few days before, assuming I was going to make money to get it back. Even worse, the mechanic fixed my car and told me it's $200 more than he had estimated when I gave it to him. I have nowhere near enough money to get my car back, and they're going to charge a holding fee worsening my situation.

I have no job, my career is on hold, I have no money and feel miserable all day. I can't find another part time job, although I search all day. I'm going to have to pay rent next month and don't know where I can get a paycheck. I'm going to lose my car soon if I can't pay the mechanic back. I don't know what to do. My Mom sends as much money as she can for food but she has little to spare.

I have to start paying my student loans back in January. I haven't even made enough money in one month that would equal that payment.

I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but I definitely wish I would just die and end all of this. I'm starting to lose hope here. Is my luck really that bad or am I just incredibly bad at life?

Edit: Thanks to everyone for your kind words and advice. Saying this did make me feel a bit better, although it brought all these emotions back to the surface. I'm just too depressed to to find any sort of temporary happiness.

e6o0d,depression,[deleted],does being constantly asked if you're going to hurt yourself or are suicidal just kinda re-enforce those thoughts?,"every time i see my therapist or pcp or talk to someone about my depression, the question of harming myself inevitably comes up in some form or other, and my reaction is usually ""i think about not living a lot, but not actually ending my life, but now that you mention it...""

i'm beginning to wonder if my shit life actually appears worse than i think and the help (pcp, shrink, family etc) i'm getting might not actually be enough to bring me back from the brink.  like, if so many other people are *that* worried about me, maybe i should be too?

i realized last week that i had enough high powered meds of different flavors on hand that a handful and some bourbon would put me to sleep forever.

going to see red neck half of my family over thanksgiving where guns are literally going to be ever present (range, hunting, and ""home protection""=loaded guns in every closet), and the thought of how easy it would be was crystal clear.

i don't *think* i'm a threat to myself, but so many professionals, friends, and family seem to think it's worth concern to elicit a ""no, i'm not suicidal"" every time we talk, that maybe i'm just ignoring the obvious?  and i'm becoming a little concerned that it may actually be  *causing* some of the suicidal ideation?  or just correlated and things are going downhill?

thanks for any comfort or experiences or anything else.  i won't see my therapist until wednesday and this just isn't something i'd bring up with my family, because, you know, it'd worry them and shit. :(

I'm going through a rough patch--to sum it all up, my job sucks, my social life is almost non-existent, and I'm having a terrible time getting motivated to change anything.  I don't look forward to anything.

I've been going to a therapist for a year.  One thing that he's pushing really hard is ""letting emotion out"".  My few friends sometimes call me a robot because I show almost no emotion, good or bad.  I think that's what my coping mechanism has been for years: get through the day, ignore all the negative feelings, and hope that tomorrow is better.  

The problem is, I can't let anything out.  I've tried to cry, listened to depressing music, thought about all of the bad things in my life, beaten myself up (emotionally) for not being able to deal with this... but nothing is changing.  I don't know how else to express emotion.  All I really want to do at this point is bottle everything back up, and hope that things get better.  

I don't know if I even have a specific question, but if anyone has any advice or similar experiences, I'd appreciate it.  

Thanks for reading.  ",16,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6ojx/letting_it_all_out_doesnt_seem_to_be_working_ideas/,1289868444
e6qyc,depression,KGtrout,Scared and going to college,"Every positive step in my life has been made out of fear. I choose to seek help for my depression because I was afraid of what my mother would do if I hurt myself. I tried to do well in school out of fear that I would not be able to survive without a decent education. I choose to abstain from drugs because I feared that I would lose myself to them. I choose to adopt a happy hopeful attitude because I was scared to face my peers as the miserable wretch that I am.

Now I'm a High School Senior, I've never had a insignificant other, and I'm going to see a psychiatrist every week. Sometimes I feel absolutely miserable and guilty that I can't get over my problems. I'm doing a half ass job of everything I do because I just don't care anymore. I find my self just spending hours inside my room, just doing nothing at all. Other days I am a happy and out going. I'm getting angry at people who don't deserve it, and I just feel guilty about things I have no control over.



I'm scared off telling my friends about this because they believe me to be funny and light hearted. I've tried talking to other kids in my school who have admitted to having depression, but I always stop talking to them because I feel like I have no right to feel so miserable when they actually have a hard life. 

I'm not really sure what to do, I can't seem to make myself try anymore, and I'm acting like an asshole to people who I am trying to be friendly to. 

I'm scared about going away to college, and I'm scared about staying home and living with my parents for the rest of my life. 

I don't think I've ever been able to make an emotional connection with anyone, because I make a joke out of everything. 

I'm scared that I'm going to end up miserable and alone. I just wanted to know if anyone could relate, maybe offer some advice. I'd really appreciate it.",7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6qyc/scared_and_going_to_college/,1289878016
e6tjy,depression,doublefuck,I'm in a really bad place and I don't know what to do,"I've been depressed for almost seven years. When middle school started, I immediately had zero friends, and I was singled out as the weird girl. Nobody talked to me except to make fun of me, usually in groups that would corner me and pretend to perform exorcisms on me because I wasn't Christian. I coped by turning off my emotions, so that nobody would see me cry. This quickly evolved into depression.

Since then I've been almost completely numb. The highest my mood ever goes is ""meh"", and the only real emotions I can feel are anger and the occasional deranged fear of a panic attack. I laugh and smile and act sympathetic at all the right times in conversation, but they're just reflexes. Usually I can keep a lid on my depression. I may feel awful, but I can still get my shit together, appreciate that I'm not starving in some third world country, and do the things I have to do. But lately I just keep slipping; I can't manage more than a day or two of acting normal before my mood falls so low that I can't stop crying, and I have to pretend to be sick in bed so that nobody will see me. 

My parents have always given me the least emotional attention of my siblings, but it's starting to get to me in a terrible way. I told them I was depressed exactly 13 months ago today, and neither of them have done anything but give me superficial offers of support. When I try to take them up on those offers, they more or less tell me that I'm a whiny bitch. They constantly call me lazy and a bullshitter for always saying I'm sick. And now they've started yelling at me for every little thing. If I raise my voice slightly or disagree and don't immediately concede the point, they start shouting, telling me that I'm the cause of their health problems. They just badger me while I repeat that I haven't done anything wrong, and I feel like I'm back in middle school.

I can't talk to the one person who usually listens to me, because things have finally started going well for him, and I don't want to drag him down. I can only sleep for a few hours at a time before I wake up panicking. I average one meal a day, and I always feel sick to my stomach afterward. All I want to do is cry and hit something. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't see an end to this.",18,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e6tjy/im_in_a_really_bad_place_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,1289888412

e74va,depression,wesdxc,I just need someone to talk to,"My first time ever posting on Reddit and I hate it has to be for this reason... but I'm completely lost.

Recently (the past month or two) I have been feeling very low and in the last 3 weeks or so things have just got worse and worse. I have been through quite a bit in the last 6 months including ending a 4 year relationship, moving out of my parents house into a house of 7 other people and meeting, falling for and breaking up with a new guy. It gets quite complicated.

I am 19 years old, female, and have been on and off the pill since I was around 16 (I have currently been off it for about 3 weeks). When taking the pill in the past I have experienced feeling down, general bad moods/mood swings and have tried 4 different pills, none of which really seemed to change that. I am no longer sure that my feelings are a result of being on the pill. 

I was with my boyfriend for 4 years, since I was 15 so we essentially grew up together. We were/are very close and I will always value him as a good friend. However I met someone around 6 months ago that made me doubt everything in that relationship, I cheated (kind of) and ended up breaking up with my boyfriend and started seeing this new guy a few weeks later. It was a very stressful situation for me and the past summer was pretty horrendous as I was completely torn between two guys. It was very much an emotional rollercoaster, but when I broke up with my boyfriend I felt huge relief. I felt so good when I started seeing the new guy.

About a month later he decides we should just be friends. I was back on the pill at this point and had been treating him very unfairly. I was crying a lot, being irrational, expecting too much from him. I was behaving in a way I had never behaved towards my previous boyfriend and I blamed the pill. I came off the pill immediately but him breaking up with me completely destroyed me emotionally. 

I'm still crying every single day. Up until last week I had completely lost my appetite, I've lost weight, I feel empty, I can't motivate myself to do anything, I don't care about anything. I'm losing friends because I just won't interact with people. I don't want to. I've had feelings associated with depression before but this is much worse. I feel helpless and like I have no-one to turn to.

I suppose an important detail would be that the guy who broke up with me recently is also one of my housemates. Meaning I see him almost every day. This isn't entirely a problem because we are still close (closer than just friends, even though that's what he says he wants) and he is willing to be there for me. He is the only person I live with who I have expressed these feelings to but he has no idea what he's supposed to do to help. I still have very strong feelings for him and he often gives me the impression that he still cares too. There is a possibility we will get back together at some point but for as long as I'm feeling like this I don't think it's likely. I would definitely say he has been giving me mixed signals about this situation though. As I said, it gets complicated. 

I don't know what I'm asking for by posting this. I guess I just need to unload everything. I suppose I'm also wondering if anyone thinks this could still be something to do with being on the pill? And of course, how can I help myself. I can't keep going on every day like this.",7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e74va/i_just_need_someone_to_talk_to/,1289938373

I'm in a shitty situation.  I'm 22 and I live at home with my mom.  Ive dealt with extreme depression since I was about 14.  At 16 I dropped out, though before that I was ""home schooled""(laid in bed), and got my GED, which is basically all Ive accomplished since then.  I pretty much didn't go to high school.  I have no job, and my car is about to fall apart.  I have 0 friends.  Not ""boohoo no one likes me"", I mean I literally have no friends.  On top of all that my mom is a sociopath.  Not the cool movie kind.  The manipulative drug addicted kind.  I'm not going to go into, because frankly its shameful, but shes a huge factor in why I'm so fucked up.  And I'm stuck here.

That's my situation.  Basically I need to start fixing this or I'm done.  I feel like this is a huge task now and if I let it get any worse there's no way Ill be able to deal with it.  And the only reason I'm not ending it is because I still (technically) have options, but that is looking less and less likely.

I do have some things going for me.  Speaking honestly, I'm pretty smart ( I mean my ability to learn and think, not my ability to keep my life in order, lol ).  I took the asvab(armed services vocational something-or-other) about a year ago and got a 98(out of 99) even though I pretty much taught myself everything I know.  Also, people aren't able to tell really how fucked up my life is by looking at me or talking to me.  I can even appear well put together and like I actually have friends.

So I need a plan.  Step 1 is get on medication, but I don't have any money or insurance so I have no idea what to do there.  Any advice would be really fucking appreciated. ",5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e75zo/first_step/,1289942168

I tried the technique where you write your negative thoughts and name the distortion and then write a rational response.  But what I wrote I couldn't think of anything to respond with.

I was dating a girl for 6 years, only person I had ever been serious with (same goes for her).  We had started living together while I was in graduate school, we were both far away from home and it made sense.  After a while it seemed our relationship just wasn't what it used to be.  Around the same time I was finishing up my degree and going through job offers and doing interviews.  I finally accepted a job across the country.  I decided that was a good time to talk to her about how I had been feeling about us, and that I wanted to move alone.  It was terrible, she was a mess, I remained stoic through most of it.  She moved back home just before I moved to my new job.

I was so busy moving and learning my new job for the first 2-3 weeks after the breakup, that I didn't have anytime to feel anything.  I would work, then eat dinner and sleep but I knew I missed having someone around.  We kept in touch, she tried to keep busy to keep her mind off of things.  4 weeks after the breakup she flew several hundred miles to go see a friend of MINE.  They then started dating...4 weeks after the end of our 6 year relationship.

I was devastated, I knew I initiated the break up, but I wasn't prepared for this.  During the break up, she told me it would take her months to get over me, and here she was with my ""friend"" a month later.

It's now been roughly 4.5 months, and I realize that I'm still in love with her, and I wish I had never moved without her.  I have not spoken to her in 3 months, and she has not tried to contact me.  Many of my ""friends"" abandoned me after the breakup, a few taking my ex out for what I would define as dates immediately after the break up.

I've never been as depressed as I am at this point in my life.  Everything I do still reminds me of her, and I dream of her.  At the same time, I don't think I could ever even try and take someone back that could move on so quickly.  She obviously didn't have feelings that were too strong if she could forget them in 4 weeks.  So I'm stuck wishing I had her back, while simultaneously being revolted by the thought of having her back.

It's been getting steadily worse, most nights when I finally get to sleep I silently hope that I never wake up again.  I feel simultaneously emotionless and yet overcome with emotions I can't comprehend.  I suppose I just needed to get this out, I don't care if anyone responds.

e7wca,depression,anon-11-17-2010,I don't know why,"TL;DR: despite an excellent apparent life, I’m mostly filled with misery and intermittent thoughts of suicide. Why?

I have an extremely comfortable life. I have no financial problems, no substance abuse problems. I have caring parents. I have done well in school and I am now about half way to a PhD, which, actually has a chance of completion despite my mental problems.

I cannot think of a definition under which my apparent life can be considered bad and yet, for almost 10 years now, I have been under what I would guess to be depression, getting worse in the recent years. I don’t remember the last day in which I didn’t wish for death in some form or another. I fantasize of cars swerving into me, of fatal lighting strikes, or various other improbable life-ending events. I’ve also been vaguely looking into and thinking about suicide on occasion, though I know I’m too cowardly to do it, not to mention not wanting to hurt my parents.

It seems my days are more and more disengaged from past interests, creativity, progress. It has got to a point that there are days during which I don’t even bother to go to school, and spend the entire day distracting myself with things of no consequence, internet, games, etc. I’ve become quite lazy. I have trouble getting out of bed and often trouble sleeping as well.

My situation doesn’t make sense to me, given the very favorable life I have here. There are some things which I speculate might be the cause of my depression, though in all cases, they might as well be effects, not the causes:

- I have no ability to make friends. I have realized this sometime ago and at times have exerted directed effort into this, thinking it might be responsible or at least related for my depression. I have trouble feeling a part of any social group, and never really succeeded in any of this.

- I can’t seem to make romantic emotional connections, though I have no problem with physical intimacy and had over the years several amazing “relations” in this regard. In none of those cases, however, was I able to develop any sort of romantic feelings. Also, the only relations I have ever been able to achieve were due to online dating systems, never stemming from real world interactions.

- I have very very poor self-esteem. I am, however, perfectly capable of reasoning about what I am, in a vaguely statistical sense, and recognizing that in fact I’m quite above average in some aspects. This, strangely, doesn’t help my self-esteem (or not enough).

I suppose there are other issues that might be mentioned but this has already gotten too long. Reading over it now, I expect it to be ridiculed. I have read a few posts on this subreddit, about people having real problems. Asking for help in my situation seems terribly insensitive to people with real issues.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e7wca/i_dont_know_why/,1290051766

e7z45,depression,depression22,I feel myself climbing out of this hole,"Hi everyone...I just thought it might make some people feel better to hear a success story. I can slowly (over the past couple months)feel myself getting better. I started getting therapy, but also made a few changes....

-I was quite angry with my mom for a while, who psychologically/verbally abused me for my whole childhood (up to 20 y/o)and just recently made peace with her. She knows how I feel about it all, that I've been depressed, and actually really seems to get it and wants to help me.

-I let my dad/stepmom know how I've been feeling instead of hiding it.

-I realized alot of my problems were stemming from vanity (body dysmorphia, feeling like I didn't have enough friends or romantic relationships)and resolved to take charge instead of pitying myself.

-I am making a real effort to learn how to be a more relaxed person, I started taking tai chi.

For a long time, 2 years in fact, I seriously felt like I would never be happy again. I attempted suicide once and thought about it almost every day for months. The thought that I could ever see myself pulling out was inconceivable. 

I am not out of the woods yet. I am sure I will feel horrible again soon enough. But I am finally feeling progress and it is amazing.

I just want you all to know no matter how bad you feel, I have absolutely been there - I think that for most of my 22 years of life I have been depressed to at least some extent.

e82rg,depression,throwacunt,I've spiralled again.,"I've been depressed on and off since 2004, but since late last year I've been very bad and as this year has progressed I've gradually gotten worse. Last year at New Years I set myself the goal to clean up my life and get out of this depression once and for all, but clearly that hasn't happened which has only made me more depressed than I was before.

My depression is stemming from a few factors, some I can control &amp; others that I can't.

1) I'm incredibly socially awkward. I get very nervous around people, especially women. I don't know why this happens, but I just do. I've tried everything I can possibly think of to bring myself out of this, but it just hasn't worked. As a result, I'm ""forever alone"".

2) Stemming from 1), I'm madly in love with a good friend of mine and I don't have the balls to tell her how I feel for fear of her rejecting me or it ruining my friendship. I get different signals from her, and everyone I've ever mentioned this to has basically told me to harden up and go for it, but I just can't bring myself to go there. So, as a result, I'm very depressed.

3) I don't have anyone to talk about my feelings with. So that's why I'm posting here. I know it's kind of pathetic and all, but the truth is that I really don't have a lot of friends. This has been a big source of depression for me for a long time and recently I've turned to alcohol as a way to deal with it. I'm not drunk 24/7, but being a college student I've been absolutely sloshed about twice a week.

4) Stemming from the alcohol use in 3), I recently made out with a friend of mine's ex-girlfriend. He's my best friend in the whole wide world, and I'm afraid I pissed him off even though he said he's fine with it. In my slight defence, we were both very drunk and it's never ever something I'd do sober. But now I'm really worried about what he thinks of me.

I know it's a long post and I really don't expect anyone to help me. Recently I've been waking up in the morning and just laying there for hours on end thinking about what it'd be like if I wasn't alive.

e8e46,depression,mybrotherwasrad,So Reddit...I've spent the past year growing into an awesome person...,"But it seems that when I'm here visiting my son the depression I've fought so hard against just returns. I haven't seen him for a whole year, and I've gotten the chance to finally spend a whole month with him. 

I've gone to counseling, I've gotten a new girlfriend, a new exciting location (Tokyo!) and I've come to terms with lots of issues regarding my father and some of the troubles from my past. In fact I reflect quite often and realize I'm a very different person from who I used to be.

Until I got here. Around my son I'm fine. But around my (soon to be) ex wife I get into old habits. She pushes so many buttons and even when I feel I've told her so she just continues to push me over the edge. 

Today for instance, we argued over whether or not I told her I was leaving Sunday with our son to visit my family, or if I was leaving Monday. Seriously. She can't concede that maaayyybe she doesn't remember me telling her. It's just so absolute that I'm wrong. And then I blew up. I started yelling and jumping to conclusions. When I realized what was going on I heard her out, but she's already shut me out because I turned into a raging caveman.

I immediately felt the guilt and hatred for my old self coming back. She's the whole reason why I'm fighting to be a better person...I was a horrible lying cheating husband, and when she left she ended up with nothing. 

I don't know who I am at the moment. I've apologized for blowing up but I feel very strongly that she just refuses to listen to me. It's fine for her to cut me off every mid sentence when I'm explaining something...I know I used to do the same thing, and I get how it feels, but I just feel like I can never do right again. 

I'm sitting in my hotel room, and I don't know what to do. I feel like I've failed so much on so many levels, and that no matter how hard I try I'm still just going to be that guy.

e8svl,depression,oiyiou123,"Mom, what's a hobo?","After being laid-off from my job in January 2009, my young children and I have ""relocated"" 3 times while I looked for work, moving from relative to relative.  We went from a typical middle-class American existence - I was a hardworking, well-educated executive with a long stable career, a beautiful home, excellent credit, great schools, beloved pets, with wonderful friends and neighbors, and earning well over $100k a year (and even had a million dollar life insurance policy!)  

I am now broke, my savings almost completely depleted and I now share a tiny spare room with my 2 kids. I am on the cusp of being a complete financial burden to my relatives ... and I wake up in the middle of the night, every night, in a cold sweat, so ashamed that I wasn't able to prevent this from happening and terrifed at the prospect of the inevitable poverty and hardships my kids are about to face.

I have all but given up hope that I will ever find work in my field again.  My industry evolves faster than most and my experience, as well as my references, are now considered old and irrelevant.  I have tried to keep up with skills and training on my own, but it is extremely expensive to do so (and unfortunately not something the government will help out with - despite my many requests).  I therefore started applying to all types of jobs last year, skilled and unskilled, and would gladly accept a job flipping burgers, waitressing, cleaning houses, sorting mail...  

But no one wants to hire me.  Even though I apply to about a hundred positions every month, I have only had 18 interviews in the past year and a half... and I have yet to receive a job offer.  When I turn up at an interview, I usually see a mix of confusion and embarrassment in people's eyes  - why is someone like me (in many ways very much like themselves, or more likely, their parents) applying for this type of work?  I suppose it's so much easier (and less frightening) for people to believe that there must be something terribly wrong with me rather than to accept that there is something terribly wrong with America. 

In just a few weeks I will join the illustrious ranks of the 99ers: millions of well-educated, accomplished professionals with years of hard work and innumerable sacrifices behind them, but who are still unable to find work after 99 weeks of searching.  

With the House and Senate continually blocking unemployment benefits to those who have been out of work for LESS THAN 99 weeks, the really long term unemployed (those who have been without work for longer than 99 weeks) gave up hope months ago of ever receiving more help in the form of a TIER 5 extension of benefits.

America's attempt at tough love is, I fear, very much misguided.  When no one will hire you and all help is also removed, you really don't have many options left.  When hope is destroyed, you are left with despair.  I don't see a future for myself anymore and I really don't want to become a burden to my already financially stretched relatives.  

The term ""hobos"" has begun to resurface in popular culture, usually in the form of jokes in kids’ shows.  When my 8 year old asked me what the word meant, I had to hide my face and the tears in my eyes as I started explaining it to him.  Up until then I really hadn't realized that that is exactly what we were becoming...  And I would rather die than see that happen to my kids (I do still have that life insurance policy after all)

Long story short, I've been getting really down lately. 
Short story long, I feel like i've blasted the last 5 years of my life out of an airlock into space. I procrastinated on going to school. I spent two and a half years focusing on a painfully unhealthy relationship which ended up costing me a really decent job because I didn't know how to tell her 'No' (there was more too it, some office politics came into play.)
I ended up moving back in with my parents at age 25. It was supposed to be temporary, but I fell in love with a girl that I thought was the one i'd spend the rest of my life with, and ended up working myself back into deeper debt, right before she dumped me. The depression that she caused has been with me for the last 5 months. 

I know now that she wasn't the one for me, but I can't stop missing her. And since I had a problem getting a grip on my emotions, i ended up losing my most recent job. 

So here I am, 10K in debt. My parents don't know just how rough a situation i'm in, and I can't ask them for the 500 bucks a month I need for minimum payments on my credit cards. I'm so ashamed of spending all that money on a girl that I can't even tell them why i'm in such a rough shape. 

The economy has made it painfully difficult to find a job in this town, and I can't even afford to move somewhere else. I'm turning 27 in a few months and I feel like i'm running out of time to actually make my life worthwhile.

I feel so alone right now, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

e8x6g,depression,DieAntwoord,I'm slowly getting worse and worse.,"Hey,

I've never really been an overly happy person, but for most of my life I was doing ok. Since a couple of years though (i'm 24 now btw), I've just gradually been slipping. My highs get shorter and rarer, and I have a hard time really enjoying anything I do. At best, I get a slight feeling of fulfillment that fades quickly. My days have become grey and meaningless, and appointments or social functions feel like chores. I still have friends, but my love live and academic prospects have been gradually declining as I can't bring myself to put in any significant effort (slight ADD doesn't help here either). I am a few credits shy of graduating, but I cannot seem to focus and write my thesis.

At this point, I feel like I'm just sinking away slowly, and I can't seem to stop it. Every day is slightly worse than the previous one. I've tried meds and several therapists. My family thinks I'm like a car that needs to be fixed and they have a completely misguided idea of how I really feel, despite my best efforts to explain.  Nothing works, I just keep gradually sliding down into a sea of negativity and inertia. At this point, I feel like I have no more fight in me, and I'm very close to halting my efforts and just letting myself go completely.

 I've been trying to get better using every way I know how for the better part of 2 years, and nothing I have done seems to have had any effect. I'm not yet suicidal, but this feeling of being powerless and unhappy without even knowing why is slowly getting me there.

e98p0,depression,depressedmdtobe,Med school life is depressing me. How do I deal with this?,"I'm in medical school in Ohio, and I know it's quite common to feel depressed during these years. I know all the things I can do in theory to try to pull myself out of this depression, but I feel like so much of it is outside of my control.

To have some context: I am part of an accelerated program. I spent two years in college, and was exclusively friends with the people in the same program. Now, in medical school, it seems like it’s the same way, the people in the program are only friends with each other, and no one else in the class. The main reason for this is that we are almost all underage, and so can't interact with the rest of the class in the main setting they all hang out in: bars. There isn't really much else to do in this area of Ohio. Additionally, the other medical students all know about the program, and most of them have a bias against the students in the program, for one reason or another. 

Talking to the upper years in the program, it seems that medical school will continue in this way: all of them hang out only with the other people in the program. At most, there are a few people who have an outside friend or two. This wouldn’t necessarily be bad, but the people in this program are honestly some of the worst people I’ve ever met. During the college years, everyone was on their best behaviors.  But by now, everyone’s true sides have come out, and I feel like there are only about 3 people who have any qualities that make them good friends. My encounters with everyone else have shown me how manipulative, untrustworthy, and uncaring the girls are. The guys are not very social, and spend most of their time playing video games. 

Seeing my ex-boyfriend everyday is the clincher. He was stubborn, cold, and unemotionless for the last few months of our relationship. No matter how much I tried to work things out with him, he never understood or respected what I was feeling, and was always convinced he was right. During the end of our relationship, he would say awful things about me and to me, and just treated me horribly and with no respect. The sad part is, the guys, and even a few of the girls “took his side” in the breakup. 

I don’t know how to start rebuilding my life. I was together with my ex for so long, so much of my life revolved around him. I’m glad I have a few good girlfriends to lean on, but they have been friends much longer than I’ve been friends with them, and so I sometimes feel like an outsider with them too. I can’t get over the fact of how such a great guy turns into such a mean person. I have never met people who were so (for lack of a better word) horrible before. I don’t know how to get out and make new friends and meet new guys in this setting. I’ve begun to see that reality is, these are the people I have to spend the next 4 years of my life with. Feeling so hurt and lonely is impacting my studies, which in turn, makes me feel more depressed . I don’t know how I can survive like this for 4 more years.

I could really use your help, Reddit.

e99vs,depression,[deleted],Hi /r/depression,"This serves the primary purpose of an introduction, but still serves other purposes. 

I'm an 18 year old male and a college freshman. I struggle with anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depression, stress, and self esteem issues. on the non clinical side of things I am sometimes misanthropic and sometimes I stereotype certain groups, especially men. 

Recently I've become more suicidal than ever, but it's still very uncommon and thus it lacks the regularity while I lack the assuredness to even get close to doing so. 

I've also been diagnosed with ADD, social anxiety, MDD (which both my therapist and I disagree with, my depression isn't that bad), and NVLD, whose strongest symptom I exhibit is fear of change, new situations, etc. Despite my aforementioned misanthropy and stereotyping, i'm neither antisocial nor socially inept (in my opinion). I'm fine interacting in short social situations with people I know little about, such as people in a new class after a month, but otherwise I get incredibly anxious. Just today I was going to smoke with someone from my CS intro class, and even got to the door, but I was topped anxious and ended up leaving while hiding as they manifested around the complex, performing mundane tasks. I don't have a license yet, so I'm waiting to get picked up. 

This experience has made me want to self mutilate more than I have ever wanted to, in recent memory, but I've never even enjoyed cutting, so don't fret about any non mental damage caused by the actions.  

In short, I help to get more out of this sub than I do out of therapp, because I can barely divulge without such indubitable anonymity, or I can only divulge to someone who I have infallible trust in. ",16,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e99vs/hi_rdepression/,1290294040

e9efs,depression,fadingaway_girl,Nowhere left to go,"I'm in my mid-twenties.

I have suffered from depression, severe OCD (not the cleaning or checking kind, but self-harm for pleasure), and impulse control disorder for most of my life.  It got worse when puberty hit.

I basically spent the last half of my teenage years chasing boys, getting drunk and high, throwing away my academic future and generally creating a mess for myself.  I was not liked in my peer group, though I wanted their acceptance so much I hung out with them anyway.  I was bullied relentlessly. 

I then met somebody else, moved away after high school, worked minimum wage jobs and took college classes here and there until years later I realized he wasn't for me, and that my life was going nowhere.

Now I live with my parents who to this day do not understand my depression, I have anxiety attacks when they try to ""talk"" with me because it brings back horrible memories of them screaming at me.  So I try to avoid them as much as possible even though I live in their home, and they are constantly threatening to kick me out on the street because I don't interact with them enough, even though I am terrified of their verbal abuse (one of them is my step father, I have great relations with my real father). All I do is keep to myself.

I have lost all my friends, my best friend included, who skipped town without telling me.  So much for a friendship that had spanned more than a decade. :(

I feel like I have nothing.  Colors are dull, I have no more joy or excitement or anything to look forward to in life.  I sleep to get away from the pain of my past, the monotony of my present.  I have no job, I want to get my Bachelor's but it's going to take a few more years and means I'll have to live here in this hell home for longer. I feel completely lost and alone and just want to end it all.  I have been nothing but a burden, I have nothing to show for myself, I'm broke and all alone.  I don't feel like my life is worth living anymore.  90% of the time I am thinking about suicide.

I guess that's why I wrote this.",4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9efs/nowhere_left_to_go/,1290320734
e9eqb,depression,fruckstrated,How do I fix myself? help,"Hello

This is a throwaway account. But I need some advice.
I know the source of my depression and I am caught in a catch 22.

Every day I feel a deep grief, melancholy and longing similar to how a parent feels after they have lost a child. Repeatedly going through the 
stages of denial, anger and grief.

I feel that I have lost something important -and I dont exactly know what it is.

I feel like my soul, or the vibrance of life and magnetism was lost, or somehow it was killed as I reached highschool.

I was not bullied - I was made fun of but I could stand up to it; I once was a trouble-making, outspoken kid who had friends.

But for more than 12 years now, any scathing verbal criticism or harsh tone directed towards me triggers a manic episode or symptoms similar to a panic attack. Also, any themes of romantic couples and expressions of sexual liberation in the media or in real life can trigger a manic rage.

I want to be able to like people and I want to be able to relate and socialize with people. Maybe it is this fear of criticism? 

I first need a likable personality.
I do not feel camaraderie or companionship with anyone.

I feel like the part of my brain that controls social intelligence is permanently damaged or undeveloped because I always feel like a confused child in social situations.

I payed 1200 dollars for a blind dating service and after six months so far, I have made no progress at all. Every single date ends the same. The most recent one I had went terribly wrong and left me on the verge of a manic episode - something that I haven't had in a long time. All the other dates feels like a damn job interview and I do not enjoy it - I feel awkward, but I need to somehow learn how to socialize so I force myself into these situations.

Every time I tried to reach out and develop honest companionship in college I was only to be stabbed in the back or figuratively have a hand put in my face. 

I recently moved out of my parent's house because I thankfully hold a steady job. Honestly, my job is the only thing that prevents me from destroying myself. I need a social safety net because I feel like my life is easily disposable. I'm simply a means to an end for society to extract my labor for all it is worth - and society does not allow me to reap any of the social 'rewards' that is supposed to come with it because my personality/genes was deemed despicable and incompatible.

 That is probably why my personality/soul needed to be killed by my subconscious mind. I have to mask myself and suffocate my personality to fit in to the mold. If you do not express the likes and interests of the mold - you are treated as an inconvenience to society. You are merely tolerated for your labor contribution.

 Now that I'm by myself, the feeling of loneliness is amplified and any violent,crazy, far-fetched fantasies of destruction that I would never act upon are hammering more frequently on the walls of my mind and don't know how much I can hold it in much longer.

I exercise 5 times a week. I have done heavy weightlifting/body building for 9 years and have taken up martial arts. I joined crossfit clubs where we have group workouts.

The effects of endorphins dont last very long and go back to feeling misanthropic and melancholic right after leaving the gym.

I'm not going to gamble my savings on a professional who might be even crazier than I.

What I want to know is, how can I develop my personality and develop a positive vibe? 

Imagining if I was another person observing myself from an objective and unbaised view, I would detect that my 'vibe' is one that repels people because it screams: ""Stay away from me - dont bother me- I am not here and dont exist"".",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9eqb/how_do_i_fix_myself_help/,1290322636
e9f03,depression,RiskyThrowaway,Moving Forward,"I am a 21 year old, male, college student. My girlfriend of six years visited me last week. She seemed stressed and sick, as she went to the bathroom multiple times where it sounded like she was throwing up. She laid next to me and cried for twenty minutes before saying anything. Eventually she said, ""I'm sorry, but I can't eat or sleep and I'm throwing up because I'm afraid of how much you'll hate me... I'm not in love with you anymore and I love someone else."" She hadn't cheated on me, she loved someone else. What followed was nearly a days worth of crying and the two of us talking it all out. My, now ex, g/f and I still really care for eachother, but she's just not sure if she loves me anymore.

She said she was not going to act on her feelings with this other guy. My ex stated that she doesn't even know if *that* is how she truly feels. Now, she's with him despite what was said. I know she lied because it would probably be incredibly painful to tell me the truth to my face. At this moment, I feel completely lost with my life. I'm the type of person who plans everything out twenty years in advance. I save my money, I write mission statements of my goals, I even keep clean schedules of all my plans. My ex acted the same, we were in such balance, and I thought that we completed each other emotionally and physically.

I feel so ridiculous and naive. My future feels so uncertain and I don't even know the point of continuing with my life-plans. Instead of working on research papers for my college I just curl up in a blanket on the floor and stare at the ceiling. I cry myself to sleep, twisting, turning, and retching at the thought of my ex's new man, kissing and touching her. The very idea of them being intimate makes me sick.

How do I rid myself of these terrible feelings? I wish I could rip them out of my body and end this self-loathing and depression. How do I begin to move forward? ",8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9f03/moving_forward/,1290324792
e9g5t,depression,toomuchangst,Realized just how shitty this year has been,"Between brutally coming to terms with being an imperfect human being and terrible partner and leaving my SO of several years because of it, moving away from my support network, drug problems, and a lot of professional failure this year (although luckily I'm still employed), and things still going shitty with no motivation on the horizon... it just makes me want to break down and cry.  I feel like I'll never be happy again, I'll never be able to look myself in the mirror with respect or pride at my accomplishments.  I only see my failures.  I'm sure it's a self-perpetuating cycle.  I lock myself in my room all day, avoid contact with people, I've called in sick when I can't manage to get out of bed.  And the shocking part to me was realizing I've thought about suicide every single day for the past couple months...

e9k3x,depression,ScotchBeatsZoloft,I wish I could believe the 'It gets better' line.,"It's taken me a long time to post this on a lame alt account but fuck it.

I've been 'diagnosed' with manic depression for the last 13 years. But my side dishes are what make life incredibly fun. Schizo-effective disorder, Social anxiety and OCD.

I've been on every anti-depressant/anti-psychotic you can name all bundled with a supersized lithium dosage. 

I've been threatened with a trip to the nuthouse (that was a fun day!), told to join 'social' groups that involve being lectured by a college-fresh kid whose rehabilitation skills involve having everyone play catch in a fucking circle, and got so sick of what my anti-depressants did to me that I turned into an alcoholic.

I know for some it gets better, but not for all.

I stopped taking my anti-depressants years ago because like in the movies, being a zombie isn't fun. I didn't work for 6 years because I needed to sleep at 2 in the afternoon. Also I was a paranoid idiot who just didn't like people. I've had 3 jobs in 13 years, and despite being good at all of them I was fucked over by a boss or a coworker for a reason not pertaining to skill or my condition.

Ugh, I need to stop typing or this may get really pathetic. I'm not trying to bring a downer on the positive advice in this subreddit, but it doesn't get better for everyone.

e9maj,depression,ZenKeys88,DAE dislike going on vacation because they know at some point their depression will catch up to them?,"I'm on a weekend trip to see some family, and last night I was laying awake for hours, just consumed by depression. I won't go into the details on that since most of us know what it feels like. But I find that on vacation it is especially awful since you can't do any of the things you might normally do to get it to go away. I couldn't have gone for a snack, I couldn't go for a drive, play music, smoke, talk to some friends online or on the phone, so I had nothing I could do but lay there and be depressed.

I can't be the only one who experiences this whenever they go on holiday.

e9t2w,depression,sorta_down,Not *really* depressed but...,"I don't think depressed is how I would describe myself, but I've felt kinda down for the last couple weeks for no reason in particular. No breakups, no major life changes, no major failures, no glaring flaws or feeling of inadequacy. Basically, I have no objective complains about my life. In fact, from a purely objective standpoint I have a lot going for me.

I don't know exactly how to describe what I mean, it's really just an overarching feeling that something isn't 'right.' Whenever I find myself with free time, few things strike me as truly satisfying. I have plenty of hobbies/interests that I could do, but none of them seem to fit the bill. Similarly, I have plenty of people I *could* call up and hang out with, but I often don't feel like hanging out with anyone. The closest way I can describe this is that feeling when you thumb through a collection of movies, all of which are decent, but none of them seem to be appealing at that moment. Essentially, the passion and desire from all those things in my life is seemingly eluding me.

I'm trying really hard to not drag my friends down with me. Lately I find myself much more quiet and lethargic around them for no real reason; my usual wit and energy escapes me and I find myself emotionally and mentally distant from the group. I do my best to pass it off as being tired or just a mood because I don't have a solution to offer them and don't want to be a useless whiner. This of course leads to nights out where I don't really enjoy myself, so I've been [deliberately] excluding myself/declining invitations to go out more and more.

On the plus side, I'm perfectly functional. I sleep fine, eat well, get plenty of exercise, and have continued to do well in school/work. I don't mope around destructively or anything, I just feel generally unsatisfied. This isn't the first time I've felt this way though. I find that I get into moods like this maybe once a year, often around this time of the year. It usually goes away on it's own after a few months, where I seemingly ""snap out of it"" and return to my normal self. I don't think it's Bipolar since the mood swings aren't dramatic enough, but I have considered it could be Seasonal Affective Disorder.

Anyway, I apologize for the long rant. I don't really know what to ask for or expect anything, but I guess it's good to put my thoughts down on writing.

e9vpe,depression,growingupishard,The wind has been knocked out of me.,"My boyfriend broke up with me recently. The circumstances are shitty, he is in mourning over the recent loss of a family member and the way he grieves is by locking himself in his room for days at a time. This wouldn't be so bad if we didn't live together and I didn't have to walk by his room wishing that I could come inside and tell him about my day. 

I care about this person immensely. I'm a painfully awkward girl, I test people's patience by how aloof I can be. I have been in abusive relationships before because people without anyone else to date end up dating me. This boy was different. He was kind, smart, introspective, and above all * patient*. He is creative, talented, and clever. He is a treasure of a human being and he is in immense pain. I want to reach out to him but he wont let me. 

When I try to tell him that I'm still here and I still care about him and that I will see him through this hardship, he shrugs me off. I can tell that he thinks I'm trying to get back with him, I'm not. I just want him to know that he still has a friend and not to lock me out forever.

And on to the part about me. I've been through break-ups before, shitty, nasty break-ups. Break-ups where the other person moves to Alaska (no seriously, *Alaska*) to get away.  I've never experienced a type of hurt like this one. I feel like my partner is gone, I feel like someone has died in my life. I want my friend back, and I want to see him happy whether he dates me or not. I want him to watch the futurama christmas special with me. Thats all, I don't need him to be in love with me. I just wish he knew how much I value our friendship and how much I want him to be happy simply because he deserves to be happy. There is suddenly a gaping whole in my life, all I want is my friend back.

This is a throw-away account. Growing up *is* hard.

I turned 19 this summer but I haven't lived at home in almost two years. I always considered myself to be an independent, mature person. I moved out young, 17 going on 40. I was so fucking wrong. I feel like such a child and I have the strangest urge to be treated like one. To be taken care of like one. I see adults in public that are roughly my parents age and wish they could take me in like some stranded orphan. I just want some kind of compassion to balance out all this hurt.

So what do I do reddit? For him? For myself? How can I reconcile my feelings of hurt and rejection with my concern for his health and well-being? My friends say ""fuck him, he dumped you."" I can't do that, he doesn't deserve that. I got fired from my dream job this summer and he was there for me completely, I want to show him the same compassion but he won't let me.

i get really sad at times. i don't know what causes it, at times it's something stupid like my father accidentally drinking my cup of tea because he thought it was his glass. 
i lock myself in my room and i start to think about my existence and my thoughts pile on top of each other and run a million miles an hour. i get scared and lonely and sad. i become a horrible version of myself, i feel suicidal and i cut myself and i don't know why, i honestly don't. as i'm doing it i think 'why am i doing this? what's wrong with me?'
i feel so stupid the whole time it's happening, i think that i'm making mountains out of molehills, i think that i'm such an idiot for feeling so helpless when there are worse things to be crying about. most of the time i think it's probably teenage hormones and that i'll grow out of it but nowadays it feels like it'll never go away. 
i have good days. i have lots of good days where i'm happy and everyone is just lovely to me and i appreciate everything about the world. i'm happy with who i am, i've accepted my looks and my body. the people i know treat me with love and affection. and most of the time i am working towards becoming a better me. i'm usually optimistic and i am grateful for everything that has happened to me, which is why i feel so stupid when i'm crying and whining about feeling sad when i know i have it easier than most people.
those days where i just feel so worthless.... i don't know how to get rid of them. and i feel so bad when i realize that those moments where i'm bleeding and feeling pathetic and so disconnected from the world and everyone around me, those moments make me feel real. when i'm feeling okay and i'm having a good day and i hear bad news about someone i love or something bad happens to me...i just don't feel it. i say 'i'll be okay' a lot, as if alluding that at that moment i'm going through a terrifying ordeal, when i'm not. 
and i don't know why i don't feel sad then. it makes me feel like a robot, like i'm not feeling things i know i should feel.
i don't know how to fix this, how to stop feeling so bad in such a short time and being okay the next day, how to stop consciously telling myself that 'this will never last' whenever i have a good day because i know that sometime soon i will feel depressed again and everything that i've been working towards, every second spent saying 'you're okay, you're not bad looking, you've got a good outlook on life, you'll have a good future' is shattered and broken in a matter of hours and when it's finished i have to start over again. 
i don't even know if it'll stop.
please help me, please tell me these will stop... tell me it's just hormones or brain chemicals or something like that because even though that means there really is something wrong with me, i'll know there is someway of fixing it.

eaaac,depression,LadyRamona,therapy going nowhere and there's a lot at stake.,"Hi. I don't know what I hope to get out of this. 
I've been depressed, or at least prone to depression, since I was a kid. My feelings are easily hurt, and in the last few years I've been on the verge of tears for basically nothing. Everything I was taught about how life is or should be has turned out to be figments of rose colored glasses imaginations. What a fucking disappointment. I just started going to a counseling place about 6 months ago and they've guinea pigged me on different antidepressants and antipsychotics- I was never diagnosed psychotic, but they gave me antipsychotics anyway. In fact, I don't even know what I have been diagnosed with. I stopped taking the antipsychotics against medical advice. Naturally the prescribing doctor is pissed that I have half a mind left to make my own choices with. My counselor fell asleep for about 3 seconds today while I was talking. I am fed the fuck up with my life and everything about it. I put so much faith into counseling fixing my mind. I'm not getting any advice, and furthermore I don't even remember what the guy even says to me, because I feel like I'm defending myself the whole time, because I'm being misunderstood. I'm always being misunderstood. 
I wanted to get into counseling after my brother died in 1996. Instead, my parents drank and pretty much left my sister and I to deal with our own feelings. I tried to commit suicide and instead of getting me help mom told me to get over myself. Disappointment. I threw myself into finding someone to love me. obsessively disappointing. Oh and medicating away my feelings too, with drugs rather than alcohol. I've smoked weed for 12 years now and I have no confidence that I have remained unscathed. I quit for a while and didn't feel any smarter or more capable. I am fairly certain that I've fucked up my head permanently. I am not smoking pot anymore, I have this thing about not letting substances control me. At least I have that going for me, otherwise I'd be god knows where doing whatever to get whatever.
Back to the misconception on my part that counseling would fix me. I have held this belief ever since I was probably about 13 or so, and I have never been able to go since cost is a prohibitive. I'm 27 now. And on medicaid. After the first few visits, I could tell this was a big waste of time. I don't have any faith that these people want to see me healed. They just want to schedule me for next week. Another fucking disappointment in life.
My husband is no help. (Another fucking disappointment in life.) He doesn't really have feelings, (that's his words not mine) and doesn't understand depression or anything else that's wrong with me. And he's part of that. Our sex life sucks and he's a porn addict. So instead of making love, all we've ever done is fuck, (again his words) and all the times I've caught him masturbating just makes me see red- I've always been the one to initiate sex and most of the time he turns me down. Likely because he's already satisfied himself. I have a password on the only computer in the house because of his passion for porn, and as I've learned quite recently chatting with strangers with his aol account. I can't trust him and I hate that. He's supposed to be helping me stand, not making me crumble further. (The counselor says that since the porn started before the marriage, that it's pretty much a moot point. thanks asshole.) So today I turned on the xbox to find something on netflix for our 2 year old to watch and I find under recently watched some sleazy stuff... even though I know he's never going to stop, it kills me inside every time I find something like this. How does one accept that life is constant and total disappointment, without completely ruining this beautiful 2 year old's life in the long run... He needs me to be something, and I feel like nothing. I have no education, no ambition; I'm going to continue getting my heart broken by my husband, and parenthood has already shown me that I've got a long hard road of disappointment ahead of me in that department as well. 
TL; DR: My life sucks and I have resigned myself to this fate.

eaan0,depression,tsuentsu,Just can't get a friend,"
Sorry for a self-focused rant, but I just need any sort of feedback, and you strangers(friends) are the only possibility for that.

I really don't know how I keep going on.  My life oscillates between quite depressed and thoroughly medicore if not lame.  I literally have nothing going for me -- things could be worse, but that doesn't make my current situation a positive one.  I'm a 21 year old grad student living by myself, and I'm basically by myself in every way, no good friends and essentially none at all (I moved away from what few friends I did have).  I'm gay, and I've never had a relationship -- and I'm not even sure I would be able to completely work with my partner's needs.  Of course, that is a non-issue because zero people, boy or girl, have ever been attracted to me, even though I would actually consider myself rather attractive -- that's probably the main difference between when I tried to commit suicide and now.
   After I attempted suicide, I guess I kind of learned that if I die then I will definitely never experience anything positive -- but living my life now is quite negative, and there's really no foreseeable change for 5-7 years (doing my degree) and even thereafter.  I tried to branch out a little and go to a few clubs, but I am intrinsically introverted (fight it as I try) and it is displeasurable to be around people who don't show any interest in becoming friends with a stranger (me).
   I definitely don't have the temprement to go to clubs, and if I did, I don't think those are the kind of guys I want to meet anyway.  I really enjoy video games and television (though I have too many responsibilities as a grad student to play enough to bring me happiness that way), so I still have some passions that I can talk about (although I dread the day that my gaming interests from 4 years ago become completely unknown to people I talk to).
   
So what advice is there for someone who can't find a friend much less a boyfriend within 3 standard deviations from my comfort zone?  Apparently I'm not good enough to be a partner, and I'm not interesting enough to be a friend.  I myself am comfortable with trying to message people I think might be good friends, but people tend to not respond well to complete strangers wanting to be friends -- especially if they live happy, social lives already.  I was really hoping that things might get better when I moved to a whole new place for grad school, but it really, really isn't getting better (in spite of my attempts).",6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eaan0/just_cant_get_a_friend/,1290479838

eac10,depression,SadfaceCaramelSauce,How do you combat the holiday blues?,"So it's the official start of the holiday season now and I'm totally depressed. My boyfriend and I were supposed to spend Thanksgiving together with my family but we broke up (or rather, *I* broke up with *him* because the LDR wasn't working and had no end date) and plans were changed. I'm now spending an entire extra week with my family and it's crippling. I miss my ex now more than ever and the house seems so empty with just my parents around. My parents who, after 25 years of marriage, have devolved from independent and talented people into passive-aggressive, codependent neoconservatives. My parents who also don't believe that depression or prolonged periods of sadness is an actual problem. (I'm Bipolar II but in a totally depressed state right now)


Staying here has been a total drag too, because we're way out in the suburbs where there's no public transit so I'm marooned at home, surrounded by drama and photos of myself all over the house when I was 25 pounds lighter and infinitely happier. I have a gym membership where I live, but no access to weights or anything here.

While I'll only be here for another week it's been hard to keep my head up. I miss my ex terribly, feel repulsive and there's just something about being back at home that makes my 24-year-old self revert to an angsty teenager. I feel like everything about myself is wrong when I am at home and there's not one redeeming thing about me. I've been trying to sleep as much as possible. I feel so repulsive right now and it's challenging for me to see good things in life. If I had access to public transit I'd go volunteer somewhere this week but I'm unsure how to cheer myself up when my options are this limited.

eavsg,depression,ragnar444,Sleeping too much and mainly during the day. Awake at night. Zero productivity. ,"This may sound stupid to you, but I am wondering if am a depressed and need to see a MD. 

These are my symptoms:
1. I am sleeping way to much (most of the time until 1 pm)
2. I don't fall asleep before 4 am due to not feeling sleepy. 
3. During the last weeks I tried going to bed at normal times -&gt; it DOES not help, I am lying awake for hours.
4. I have like 5 different alarm clocks. I ninja-switch them off in the morning and go back to sleep. 

This drives me insane. Think about it, If you wake up at 1, you take a shower, have lunch, attend to daily business until 5 pm. 
It's insane, the whole business day is over and you're just getting started. 

For me this is always happening when I have no fixed schedule. I am a university student and don't have to attend any lectures at the moment (long story). 
But I DO have things to do. And I can't get any of this shit done when my only productive phase is when other people relax or go to bed. 

Interestingly, if I HAVE to be somewhere, if I meet someone, if I have an appointment, I magically wake and get up appropriatly. But if there is no pressure I am sleeping in.

Any advice from anyone?

eavv5,depression,[deleted],glimpses of hope,"I've dealt with depression for at least the last 10 years (I'm a 21yo male), been on every class of antidepressant except maoi's, and even had ECT. I have never found counselors to help. I try to goto the gym 5 days a week. I'd like to go back to school, but never have energy, Ive had every test imaginable for this, with no results, besides low testosterone, which I refuse to take TST (androgel) because its only going to make it worse in the long run, not to mention its fucken expensive. The doctor has no clue why this is low either, and I know its not normal for someone my age. Along with this, I have extreme cognitive fog, much like being high, drunk, and extremely tired, times a billion, and never goes away.
Back on topic, my depression goes from bad to worse, usually I'm in a blah mood, and apathetic towards everything, and I dont seem to be able to feel anger anymore. Some days I'll feel happier than others, trying to plan out leaving everything and traveling to other countries, which is entirely possible, I have no friends/relationships I'm leaving, and no other commitments besides a depressing job. I always hit a wall planning an income method, and usually give up at that point. Besides those bursts of 'happiness', I feel so trapped, useless, and alone. I used to do quite well in school, even got into a good engineering college, which I dropped out of due to depression and then got ECT.
Since then, I got a shitty, and useless associates degree, I'd like to go farther, but I fear the same thing will happen, everything will just pile on and I'll snap again.
Some nights I think about suicide a lot, 3 years ago I drank myself to the hospital one night I suppose it was a miracle or some shit that someone found me and I survived, with a bac that abnormally high.
Now whenever I think about suicide, I always remind myself, a way out will be I can leave the country someday. 
But this only helps to remove the initial feeling, not the depression.

I need some help with direction, motivation, anything, I have 0 support, if I ever mention or a friend ever finds out I deal with anxiety and depression, they tend to shy away from me.

eazxk,depression,inquilinekea,Post-breakup depression - what should I do?,"i've finally corrected all my thinking and reconciled myself with the notion that there's a very high chance that my ex (of 7 months) will probably never talk to me again and that i must prepare to live a life without her. She has already refused contact with me for 6 months, and I've pretty much been emotionally broken for that same period of time. There has been one phase of improvement (mostly since I got more information and accordingly corrected my thought patterns), but the improving has finally stagnated. 

My problem is, that I think I've lost my capacity to enjoy things. I simply don't enjoy anything anymore. Occasionally, I can try to find things to laugh at, but those things are usually only temporary sources of laughter. They're not even sustainable sources of laughter (or enjoyment), since almost all of them involve trolling to one extent or another. I have some problems with energy/concentration, but my Adderall for ADD helps with them. But it's still difficult for me to maintain the attention span to do most other things.

Yes, I do have friends, and yes, I do talk to people. The problem is that talking to people doesn't make me feel any less lonely anymore. Sometimes it makes me temporarily feel better. I know that the world is interesting, that I have friends to talk to, that there are so many things I can do. And my past 12-year old self would be SO happy if he could exchange spots with me. But in the end, I just get bored with everything so quickly. Sometimes I can briefly find things to laugh at. But those are only funny for a short time. 

So that's what I'm trying to find a solution for. Maybe it sounds like depression - I don't know. It's not full head-on clinical depression, but since I'm frequently sad despite correcting all my destructive thought patterns, I don't know what it is anymore.

So maybe I'm trying to find the best meds for that. But I'm very skeptical of SSRIs because they're no better than placebo for mild-moderate depression. I have no sources for weed or other psychedelics. therapy might not even work because i've corrected my thinking (and even convinced myself that i probably will eventually land someone, simply because i'm super-exceptional at advertising myself online and that the chances will improve as I get older). but it's not helping me feel any better.

The problem is, I probably don't even qualify for a diagnosis. Here are the symptoms of dysthymia:

""""To be diagnosed, an adult must experience 2 or more of the following symptoms for at least two years:[5]

    Feelings of hopelessness
    Insomnia or hypersomnia
    Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions
    Poor appetite or overeating
    Low energy or fatigue
    Low self-esteem
    Low sex drive
    Irritability [1]""""

But I have none of those other than irritability. My main problem is simply that I'm still lonely and sad. And I'm starting to lose my motivation. And it's persisting, even though I've changed my thinking. I know that I have things better off than most people, and I'm a hyper-rational person who reads LessWrong and Overcoming Bias, but it's not going to help if I've lost my capacity for enjoying things.

eb8i3,depression,reallyanon,a torrent of emotions.,"Long post, kind of off-my-chestish but it's more related to depression.

I slept late today, since I didn't have to go into work until 1 pm, so I let myself drift in and out of sleep in the morning. I had an incredibly pleasant dream about my first girlfriend, who I met in high school in 2004, and upon waking up I feel like shit because I miss her so much. We broke up in 2008 or so. Is it any wonder that I prefer sleep to real life? While I have had many nightmares (nuclear holocaust being a perennial ""favorite"" of my subconscious), sleep tends to be a time when I can forget the horrors of real life and actually enjoy myself to some extent. 

It's similar to driving around in a place with no cell phone reception... totally cut off from anything bad, no chance of ANYONE giving me bad news... which is all I really seem to get.

I've always struggled with depression, and that's part of why it ended with my ex (and even why it began, I think she was attracted to me because I seemed like a tortured intellectual.) I loved her, at the time, and I tried to show her that, though I was never a good boyfriend, really. (In general, I'm not a good person, really.)

I've had a few short-term girlfriends since her, but I've never met anyone who made me feel like she did. Being fat and unattractive, it's difficult to meet women of any kind. I don't even know if I have much of a personality-- I believe that I am defined mostly by my depression, and even though I was overcoming it for a long time, I have no idea who I'd really be without it. 

So I come to the idea of loneliness... I have a few friends who I see sporadically, and I care about them, but they don't seem too interested in me, really. Girlfriends tend to take up their time, it seems. I am trying to convince myself that being alone almost constantly isn't so bad, but it's tough when it's constant and unending. But God, do I miss her. I miss having someone to help support me and for me to help support.

I feel like I have too many issues to deal with-- emotionally, mentally, personally, socially, physically, financially, and scholarly, and I have nothing positive that really balances that out. 

I want to give up, as I feel like I am going to buckle under the pressure anyway, and I really resent having been born into this world. I used to feel like I was so strong for having lived for this long with such personal pain, but now my strength has been sapped. I don't know what to do.

ebfbu,depression,hcsad,lonely and it feels like everyone around me is doing more than I am,"Even though I do have many friends, including some very close ones, I constantly feel alone. I feel ancillary, if that makes sense. People have these core groups they associate with and hang out with all the time. I just have individuals that I see sometimes. 

And most of my closest friends live nowhere near me so it's a struggle to see them. I mostly talk to them online. And even when I do do things with them, it feels as if it's more restrained. I rarely get invited to things and I don't have large networks of acquaintances that I can hang around when none of my closer friends are around. I try to contact people, even people I only know tenuously and nobody ever responds. It's a struggle every weekend night to find someone to hang out with. And that doesn't even consider the fact that I'm the one doing all the work all of the time. 

I have meeting and interacting with people I don't know so well and conversations dry up pretty quickly. I don't know how to perpetuate normal chitchat. Unless I'm talking about something substantial I can't keep up. 

I feel like most people don't contact me because I have some kind of emotional blockage system preventing people from really contacting me. So I'm not essential. I'm invisible.

Which doesn't even say much for my lack of skills with women. I guess I'm awkward and quiet. I don't know how to approach people and nobody ever approaches me. I have only had one girlfriend and it ended rather disastrously. I saw another girl about a year later for about a month but she ended up not feeling the same way I guess. 

After the first relationship I felt incredibly suicidal. I couldn't move. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. It felt better to drink, play video games and watch TV. 

I was finally happy when I met this second girl. It felt like I had finally got the kind of girl I had always been chasing but never attained. I thought everything was going to finally get better and then it just crashed and burned. I'm always so afraid that it's because I'm so quiet and awkward that it makes them feel uncomfortable. Now since I've known her her extremely successful life makes me even more miserable because I feel inadequate. I feel like a failure and that I can never achieve where she is and that I will never change.

I feel stuck and that because I will never change there's no point in going on because I will never have the motivation to get what I want. And it just scares me that because I will never change or get what I want then I should just end it.

ebhlt,depression,localover,Am I depending to much on my relationship to cope with my depression/anxiety issues?,"Throwaway, SO is a reddit user. I've had depression and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) issues since jr. highschool which have gotten progressively more severe in the past 5 years or so, given some highs and some lows. I'm about to turn 25. I can definitely say there have been some experiences in the past few years that have contributed to my issues (rejection from some one I thought was ""the one"", substance abuse, failing certain goals I had for school and where I wanted to be in life etc.), but probably one of the BEST things that has happened to me was getting together with my boyfriend almost 3 years ago.  In our ""honeymoon"" stage, I can honestly say that was the happiest I've ever been that I can remember, aside from early childhood maybe, love definitely is a drug. Though the new exciting ""honeymoon"" stage may be over, my feelings for him have only gotten stronger, he really is the one thing that makes me happy.  We spend time together everyday, if not all day together, we even recently began working with each other.  We get along great, and do everything together, we're best friends.  Being around him makes me happy, we make each other laugh, I feel safe and I don't concentrate on the bad thoughts in my head as much....
Here is where my concern comes in, while our relationship has grown progressively over the past few years, my issues with GAD and depression have gotten severely worse due to other circumstances in my life that were initially unrelated to our relationship.  I'm beginning to notice that I often feel anxious when I'm not with him, or as cheesy as this sounds, incomplete, but almost in an unhealthy way.  I have never been a clingy person, and in past relationships I've always been the one to want my own time and space, and have historically been more content being alone.  Always considered my self to be pretty independent, especially in a tomboy sort of way, ""don't need a man for anything"" mentality.  Now I just want to be with him all the time, and I've even gotten appalled at myself when I've realized I've felt the need for him to accompany me or assist me with things which in the past I would have easily accomplished by myself.  I'm also concerned because we both come from the same circle of close friends which we have isolated ourselves from, we used to hang out with friends every week, now we seldom do, we usually just stay in.  I've never wanted to be one of those couples, and I've never wanted to be some one who loses their identity in their relationship but sometimes I feel like I am. Everything about our relationship is perfect except for the fact that I think I depend on it to much for my happiness, I think I've let the relationship take up too much of my life I guess, I don't see friends as much and don't do certain hobbies that made me happy, like painting, because he makes me happy so I give all that energy to the relationship.  Now I get anxiety and get depressed when I think about the neglect in other areas of my life due to my focus on my relationship...so my source of happiness and escape (my relationship) is now contributing to the things I'm trying to escape from.

He's been acting kind of depressed for the last week, and I came home from university today to find him still in bed. He told me being awake felt wrong and was generally pretty angry at me for talking to him when he was trying to sleep - he'd been in bed about 20 hours by that point, it's about six hours later now. I told him I was worried about him, he said he'd make a shrink appointment to get me to go away, and then he pointedly rolled over and hid under the covers.

What do you suggest I do to help him, and help myself not get dragged into the depression lifestyle? I'm lucky enough to have very few classes tomorrow. My game plan is to make an awesome breakfast tomorrow morning and drag him kicking and screaming out of bed to eat it, then offer to work out or hang out for a bit.

* I don't have any close friends I can truly trust. I don't know anyone who I can have an intimate conversation with, anyone who I know cares about me just as much as I should care about myself
* never had a girlfriend
* never kissed or held hands with anyone (virgin)
* my parents are poor and so am I
* I have a terrible relationship with both of my brothers; I don't even talk to them
* no meaningful relationships with extended family
* I'm ugly. I've even been told this a few times in my life. I have crooked teeth which need braces. Pale skin
* I don't like looking at my face because it makes me sad when I think about how unattractive I am
* I'm socially awkward. Never been to a bar, club, or dance
* I don't drink or smoke so it's hard to socialize with people
* I have terrible clothes
* I'm in paralyzing debt from school, from which I may never escape
* I have never been out of the country so I have absolutely no traveling experience, which is embarrassing 

What really depresses me is the relationship issues. I don't know what mutual affection feels like -- I don't know what it feels like to have a girl look longingly it my eyes and know that I feel exactly the same way. I sometimes think ""i'm only 23.. I have plenty of time to find someone. Love happens when you least expect it."" But I thought that at 18, then 19, 20, 21... I feel deep sorrow when I see a nice couple my age and realize I haven't experienced that. I feel like my potential is flying past me and that I wasn't born to experience this world. I've missed out on so much that will never come back to me because of my age.

Sometimes to pick myself up, I attempt to count the good things in my life. One of those would be my health, but I feel even that is slowly slipping away because of the depression. I'm losing weight because of the sadness and it's slowly killing me. Even when I think happy thoughts, I think about my teeth, which is something that enters my mind everyday. I think about what my life would be like with nice ones, like what if that was the key?

I also think constantly about what my life would be like without any debt, even with all other issues present. I would totally just drop my things and leave this life behind. But it seems there is no room for re-invention given my current circumstances.

I'm constantly having problems with explaining people how I feel, because I seem to be slow paced or not give a fuck about anything.

ebqgk,depression,senae,I can't seem to make myself do anything.,"I'm on my second month of SSRIs and I feel like they've stopped working. I have to write 1000 words about biofuels (which I completely and totally don't want to do), I have a test in less then 2 hours I should be studying for, and I probably have a 4+ hour C assignment due on friday that I haven't even looked at yet. I don't want to attend class, and I spend more time sitting on the bus then actually learning.

I decided to change schools because I felt trapped in the middle of no where, but after spending the summer working for my parents I ended up starting the year without a parttime job. I still don't have one, so I've been living at home, a 90 minute bus ride away from school and any theoretical friends I might have made. (And when my parents heard that I was starting to look for a job in September they scolded me for not looking for one over the summer.)

Which brings me to my next problem, I can't talk to people. I try, but I get so caught up in my own anxiety that if there's 2 strangers within earshot I can't think. Thanks to this I know literally 2 people in my school, and I've only talked to one of them outside of class (very briefly, about class). I'm pretty sure this is where most of my problems come from. The only person I've had a conversation with *this month* is my 8-year-old niece. My friends from 2 years ago are all scattered about, and I only see any of them (including my best friend that I'm head-over-heels in love with) once every 2 months or so.

I wake up every day and I try to tell myself that I'll actually do something productive- homework or exercise, normally- but I know that I can't do it. I think about talking to someone at school, but even while I think it I know that I'd never be able to. I'm absolutely, completely in love with my best friend, and I know that she doesn't feel the same way (even though, at the same time, I don't *actually* know). 

I don't know how to get better. That's what I've been trying to do all year but I feel like I'm spinning my wheels in the mud.

ebyxc,depression,seanm27,Has anyone had any luck with non-Rx solutions to depression?,"I'm a 28 year old male who has been severely depressed for a few years now.  I was always an anxious and depressed person but personal problems in my life really pushed it over the top for the last 4-5 years.  It is now to the point that I have trouble getting myself to do anything, I have not felt joy in so long I can hardly remember what it is like.  I fake smile and fake laugh my way through each day.  I feel catatonic.

Anyway, my doctor recommended Wellbutrin, which on the face of it seems like a possible solution except that I am worried it will make me more anxious (or possibly even cause panic attacks), and I would have to quit drinking.  I have cut back on my drinking in the last year but it is still something that I like to do with the few friends that I rarely see.  I feel that losing alcohol would be a significant impediment to my already crappy social life.

So has anyone had any good results from meditation, exercise, jogging, or anything else that I could do?  I know these things are *supposed* to help but I have never personally met someone  who claims it helped them.

ebzmr,depression,FantasticFantasy,Broken Shards Of A Man,"Hello, 

Where to start? .. I have had bouts of depression from a early age, around 8 or so, from what I can remember, but it may have been before that too. 

I'm (male) 25 years old now, I've gone through a few moment of planning how I would commit suicide, I could not do anything, partly out of fear, partly thinking I would just cause heartache for others too. 

Restrictions of doing things by parents, low school grades, failing and almost getting close to being kicked out of college, for low attendance, being fired from work, and now .. over 2 years out of work, unemployed. No friends, hardly speak to anyone including family (I live at home and stay in my room most of the time), no female friend in my life (although I came close a few times), procrastination, feeling of nothing or not being bothered, putting on weight (about 2 stones - 28 pounds), social anxiety and low confidence. 

I just want, at times some interactions, deeper than just small talk with someone, someone to love, hug, maybe dance with.

I have researched some, over the years, on self-help, a little psychology, depression, social anxiety. It seems that knowing what to do, is not helping, which also makes me guilty, as I feel I should be doing something. But there are times where I can't even feel, or show emotion, I rarely do, right now.. is a rare moment, a few tears fell.

If your looking for a point to this post, I don't know what it is yet, I thought about posting a few weeks back, but I didn't, I didn't know how to put it, but I'm not bothering about that now. 

The thing is, I know what would probably be said, go to the gym, get out more, and whatever else, I'm a little tired to try list them. 

I cannot get myself to do them, I've thought whether that is my procrastination, depression, laziness, maybe something else or a mixture of them. 

So I'm not really asking what to do, actually I don't know what I'm asking for, or if I'm asking for anything. I guess at the very least I'm looking for attention (there goes my commentary on myself ha).


Here's something I wrote, maybe someone will like it, I'm not exactly a poet, but ... well but nothing, here it is:

&gt; You reap what you sow, Whether or not you know. 

&gt; What's molded is not forever so, But will you let it go? 

&gt; I'm the broken pieces of glass,

&gt; Broken shards of a man who knew, but cowered 

&gt; Knowledge is not power, power is what you do.


That's all I'm up to typing about this for now. Bye. 

This all sounds a little silly now when I read it back.

ec9cg,depression,jasher,My best friend [f] is leaving m behind... kinda,"Ok so he thing is, I was always lonely. My obsessive nature didn't allow me to engage a relationshi with any girl that isn't conservative enough to make me feel secure.

Then, one day, I've found that kinda girl, she was a bit of a late bloomer in EVERYTHING. I was her first bf, her first kiss and her first lover [I'm 23, and she is 21 lol]. Anyway, I have always been suffering what many people have called borderline or light bipolar, however unconfirmed [I have a bipolar, and a schizofrenic in my family on both sides...]. Anyway, my history involves me raging over many girls and relationships, me having racing thoughts or obsession with someone caring for me and seeing me for what I really am. Whenever a girl would start to criticise on my conduct I'd start to fall in defense and negate everything she says, even if I think eventualy that she is right. 

I seem to be unable to get out of this aggressive reaction spree towards people who care for me but express disapproval. I always shout at them, and they can't understand, or won't accpet that I am struggling with emotons that are somehow beyond my control.

Anyway, this girl I've met, we broke up and ended up being friends/fuckbuddies anyhow, since we're in the same class in college. However, I constantly feel as if I am 'the bitch' here, agreeing to everything she wants. 

I have a problem both with getting my shit together and this quasi-relationship working. The worst thing is that I keep arguaing with my close ones on days when I feel like if I'm several different people at once, or over the course of the entire day, and I don't know how to handle my own reactions and emotions, and hence am unable to maintain relationships with people.

ecdt4,depression,powerlessfriend,How do I help bring my best friend back from the edge?,"Reddit,

My 23 y/o best friend is slipping away and I have no idea how I can help pull him back from the edge.

The background story is a novel unto itself, but the most condensed version I can provide: he was my best friend in high school and then we had a falling out.  I was crushed by said falling out but too stubborn to let him ""win"" so, like stupid teenagers do, I prolonged pointlessness.  We were horrible to each other behind our backs and feelings were hurt and related friendships tested etc etc.  We ended up going to the same college but didn't see each other much.  As I started growing up a bit as I progressed in college, I made it a point to try righting my past wrongs and apologizing for assholish behavior.  Eventually I apologized to him and decided I wanted to try to renew our friendship because it was really special to me and, if I don't outright have feelings for him (fucked up I know), I just found I couldn't stop caring about him no matter how much we'd both moved on to new social situations.

Anyway, we became decently close again but it's not like before and probably won't ever be.  But he had changed a lot since we were previously friends.  He became a pothead and while I'm far from a prude and 420-friendly myself, I mean the kind of annoying pothead who defines himself by that term and pretty much solely concerns himself with weed and talking about weed, etc etc.  Even still, he takes so much pride in being a stoner even though, at times, I fear he is nothing but a stoner.  I don't give a shit about recreational drug use, but his weed habit has more or less rendered him useless.

I didn't put together until a little while ago that he does that because he's a total escapist and doesn't want to face reality.  Because he fucked around so much in college and made such a point of not giving a shit about anyone or anything, he did not pass all courses require to graduate and still cannot pass some basic courses.  As a result, he feels really stupid and worthless and powerless and just further attempts to escape instead of seeking help or a tutor or professor and continues to fail and continues to hate himself for it.  Vicious cycle.

This has been slowly getting worse for a while now, to the point where now he insists on being alone 24/7.  I've tried being there for him with every ounce of sincerity I possess, I've called and written him and left him four years' worth of e-mails and try to do everything in my power to be a good friend even though truthfully he's not a very good friend to me.  He used to be such a happy kid and now all he talks about his how he thinks his parents will outlive him and how he wishes he wasn't alive, even though he says he doesn't have the guts to kill himself.  I did get him to promise, at least, that he would call me if he ever even thought about it and talk things through with me.

Against everyone's advice, I'm trying to save him.  But I don't know how.  Everyone reminds me of how hurt I got last time I got close to him, and they're probably right.  But I feel like...if I don't save him, nobody will, you know?  His parents are useless.  His friends have mostly moved on because they paid attention in college, otherwise all he has left are the kinds of fuck-ups falling out into rehab.  He doesn't have anyone left but me and he doesn't seem to want my help.  But I'm the only one, I think, who can help him.

All he does now is stay in his room all day, get high and avoid human contact.  He's convinced there is no point to his life because he's worthless and cannot get a degree.  He's accumulating a ton of debt by staying in these courses he has no intention of trying to pass, which depresses him more I feel.  When I try to suggest jobs and such, he seems to think everything is beneath him and he would rather kill himself than take any of the numerous jobs I've had through the years (my parents have made me work, and work hard, since 15...his parents have never attempted to set any boundaries or parent him even once thus he has zero work ethic and thinks jobs like retail positions are degrading or something, which of course makes me feel bad when considered how many of those positions I've had even though I'm a college graduate.)

So I know it's a fucked-up, and this is a story that takes six years to tell, but I'm scared to death that I'm the only one left to help and no one else can or will.  I love my friend, I really do, but on the same hand I realize I shouldn't or shouldn't get involved because he doesn't really seem to care about me or check up on me or anything of that nature and I'm just setting myself up for failure by staying close to him.  I actually tried to ""break up"" a few weeks ago and stay friendly but cut off all possible contact, but that didn't take because in being friendly and asking how things were, I stumbled upon this whole short-of-suicide mess.

How do I help him?  I have no idea anymore.  I spend too much of my time worrying about it, too.  I was in tears when he was hinting at suicide, and it kills me to know he's all alone and avoiding everyone else.  What should I do?  Again, I know it's a long story, so more details are available.

TL;DR My friend stays in his room all day getting high and thinks about dying, doesn't want to talk to anyone, thinks his life is over at 23 years old.  I have no idea how to help.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ecdt4/how_do_i_help_bring_my_best_friend_back_from_the/,1290840347

ecjef,depression,Rog3rThat,Feeling like a failure all my life,"Just some things I want to get off my chest. I come from a family of 4 brothers. When I was 8 I took part in an admissions test for my nation’s accelerated learning program, which will last till the end of high school. Only the top 0.1% make of the nation’s cohort make it in, and it’s similar to an IQ test. Out of my siblings, I was the only one who didn’t make it. 

Needless to say, my parents were disappointed and it all went downhill from there. Whatever I do is never good enough. Now I am 21 years old, and have no confidence or self-esteem. I dropped out of school twice, while my brothers represent the country or school in maths, science or sports competitions. 2 of my brothers had straight As for Os and A levels, and had scholarship offers from the nation’s top universities and organizations. My eldest is getting 1st-class from the nation’s number one college.

As you can see, I am like the black sheep. It doesn’t help that I am the shortest, making me feel like the runt of the litter. Some days I am able to laugh it off, to joke thinking it will be better, but sometimes I just cry myself to sleep feeling like a weakling.

I want to shake off the feeling, but everytime I do it comes back after a while. It seems that for the rest of my life I will forever be the weakest, and I wish I didn’t had so much pressure from my environment growing up. The future seems so bleak… how can I stop feeling so terrible?

Tl;dr  Constantly outshined by brothers, now an adult with no confidence. How to stop feeling so shitty?

Normally I could deal with emotional issues, but the events that were going on in my life was starting to affect my job--so I gave in.

During the time I as on celexa, I noticed I as kinda cold to people.  In May, I got rid of the main source of my depression (wife).

Now the interesting part was in June and July I started to notice that my previous fears stopped being apparent.  I no longer felt afraid of heights (bridges, leaning against windows in a tall building, climbing things I would not have normally.)

Also, I had a drowning experience when I was 11 that turned me off from deep/untamed water for all of my adult life--this summer I had no reservations about going into ponds, swimming in the canals, all the icky stuff.

I also stopped driving as much, specially at night because I felt myself not caring about how fast I would go on the highway, etc.

I never cried in High School or anything, knew I was happy, and was always the one who brought all my friends together. 
I was really lucky (though it's unlucky now, to adjust to not being around them) to have 10+ friends that I clicked PERFECTLY with, in high school and before.



I know so many others feel this way, and then I know so many are in worse positions than mine and it just makes me feel worse.

I seem to have all the symptoms that I find of depression, except that I'm extremely afraid of going crazy. I am scared to go to sleep at night because my mind starts to wander and I feel like I'm crazy. 
The issue with not being able to or wanting to go to sleep at night is that I, (besides getting sick and even more tired) can not go to morning classes.
I'm considering taking next semester off but I'm worried about ending up stuck in a worse spot than I am now.

All my problems are just this infinite loop that I seem to make up in my head - all my imagination now just works against me because I've been feeling like this.
This is the part that kills me:  Thoughts that scare me, that enter my head and I can't get them out, are thoughts of the future.. of me thinking about suicide, of something terrible happening to me in the future, of me being stuck like this.
I'm not suicidal or self-destructive, but the thought of being like that scares me, and then I feel crazy. And I try to explain this to my friends/family they think I'm suicidal and then I just feel awful.
Does that make sense? 

I know it's not good to say 'I don't deserve to feel badly, people have it worse'.. the reason I mention it is because I'm not really sure what's wrong.. and so I can't figure out how to fix it.


A good portion of my best friends throughout my life have been depressed and all have had traumatizing experiences with counselors/psychologists, and hated anti-depressants. So my views on those are not good.. at all. 

Should they be?
Is/was anyone else in this position and can offer any advice, or point me to a good site?

I feel my main problem is that there are things I want to do, longboarding, stuff with computers, slacklining and other things. I really enjoy doing those activities, and I have many opportunities to do so. Hell, I helped start a local community of longboarders less than a year ago. I don't know why I don't do things I like anymore, i just don't. It feels like days go so fast but weeks go so slow. Because of my issues with time, I'm about to fail 2, maybe 3 of my 4 classes. I pay for my school, food, internet, gas and most of my car insurance, but no rent, utilities or cellphone bills. I live in a converted 2 car garage behind a house my mom owns, so she worked out a deal where the tenants pay for my minimal utilities, and she lowers the price but she still makes money on it.

I work ""part time"" (hard for me to call it part time when I've been getting ~35 hours a week) at a job I enjoy. I get to make people happy every single day at work. Work is really the only thing I do well. I'm doing poorly in school, but I'm never late for work and I'm very good at my job. It's been a sort of dream of mine to work on a rollercoaster after playing rct for years and watching TLC and Discovery when I was a child and watching in awe at how things worked. I make 7.50 an hour, and only 25% of my money goes towards bills (was 50% before people moved in and started paying rent). In the two months I've had the job I've purchased some nice things (htc evo, used ps3 and gt5) but I always manage never even save 20 dollars per paycheck. Other than the two expensive things which are honestly a very small part of what I spend, I spend my money on food and snacks.

Ugh, I feel like nothing's coherent in this.

I feel like I need to get out of where I'm living. I'm going to be skipping this upcoming semester of school. I'm hoping to save 2 hundred a month and see if I can move to washington where my aunt owns a store. I don't talk to her much but I think if I explained the situation to her then she would let me stay with her for a short while to get things sorted out. I've looked it up online, and a greyhound costs 121 dollars to get there if I book early enough. I know my parents wouldn't mind keeping my things for me while I get things sorted up there, and I could sell what I don't need, such as my monitor, and computer so I can buy a laptop.

I feel out of place in the state I'm in. I've lived in moderate sized towns and large metro areas here, nothing really feels right. I think moving to washington and into a more liberal area will help. And experiencing mountains and landscaping instead of abysmal flat land everywhere might be the change I need.

I'm not going to reread anything I've written, If I do I might just erase it. I've done so before. I'm 19 by the way. I'm sure a lot of this doesnt really fit together too well, or as well as I had hoped but it's good enough.",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ed3j5/i_keep_failing_classes_and_i_keep_over_spending/,1290996874

Then, my recently miserable self messed up some things, and it went on a downward spiral from there, every hour to come was worse than the one before. Then I ended up in my bathroom, shouting and crying at the mirror, filled with so much disgust and disappointment towards the reflection I saw in it. I wanted to beat the living crap out of him and straighten him up. And the helplessness made my anger even worse.

edn2s,depression,enken90,My way out,"I was never really diagnosed as a clinically depressed person, so I don't know if I can relate with it, but I know that I can relate with a lot of the feelings a depressed person goes through. I want to share this because I think I can offer some advice to people who are feeling depressed and because I want to get my thoughts down on ""paper"" for the first time since I started getting better.

A little background information about me: I am a 20 year old male. I come from a textbook middle class home, my parents are both very supportive and loving, I have never been bullied in school or anything like that, always gotten good grades in school and I have always had a relatively big social circle. My school preformances echo that of a lot of other stereotypical redditors; ""The boy is brilliant but extremely lazy"" was usually how my teachers described me. I am currently studying math, planning to get a finance related job. 

As you can see, my upbringing and background doesn't really hold a fertile ground for psychological issues. I guess I've never been a jolly type, but definitely not depressed either, until this year. 

I think everything was trigged by my renewed affection for an old flame of mine. I quickly realized that I would never be able to pursue a relationship with this particular girl and it made me feel really under the weather. Then, some time during this summer, something snapped completely. Suddenly, every second of every day was filled with sadness. I could be doing something mundane like eating dinner or going to the store and suddenly feel the urge to just lay down and cry. I stopped eating normally, I couldn't sleep well, I started obsessing about my failures in life, never giving them a moments rest. I'm not going to lie, I truly and deeply hated myself. I woke up every morning and couldn't stand being me. 

The next logical step for me then was to stop being me. I became self destructive. I stopped going to school, I stopped socializing. I went days without any human contact even though I live in an appartment shared with 7 other people. I slept 13 hours a day and was still dead tired when I finally got out of bed. I failed out of one of my classes and didn't even care. I started punishing myself physically and mentally by starving myself and telling myself over and over what a failure I was. Telling myself that I'm going to die alone because I'm shy and awkward and have a bad stutter. I spent two months doing nothing but this. No schoolwork, no partying, just hurting myself physically and mentally all day. 

I was hauled into this spiral of self destruction during the summer and it continued until mid october. As quickly as I had fell into this, I managed to snap out for a moment. I realized that if I wasn't a failure already, I was on a very dark path to becoming one. I started reading about really successful people, particularly Arnold Schwarzenegger amazed me. He had against all odds made it big in 3 remotely different and remotely difficult professions (bodybuilding, acting, and a political career). I watched the bodybuilding documentary centered around him called ""pumping iron"" and was inspired by his machine like, hard-working mentality. I started lifting weights myself and discovered that I felt a little better during my training sessions. It was a way to distract myself from my negative thoughts because I was so focused on getting the weights up one more time. 

I read more about bodybuilding and found out that my diet (even the one that didn't involve starving myself to death) completely sucked, and had sucked for quite a few years. I began to change it day by day and felt less sluggish than before. Soon I was back to only sleeping 6-7 hours per day. 

Nowadays I feel better than I have maybe in years. My life has gained back some of its purpose and I have gotten back some of my motivation and life goals. I've stopped being self-destructive and I've stopped avoiding people. I used to believe that people hated me or avoided me, and I've realized now that maybe I wasn't as good at hiding my inner self as I thought I was and that people avoided me for that reason. I'm getting more positive feedback from people now than I have in a long time, and it helps me continue to build my life up again. 

I also want to give some advices to people who maybe are depressed or are on their way to depression, because I know how you feel and I know that it's the most horrible experience I've been through, and no one deserves to experience it. 

**My staple routines for fighting depression or negative thoughts:**

**Have a natural sleep cycle** - This is definitely number one for me. I hated getting up late because I considered it a failure. If I got up late, my day was already ruined because I had to punish myself for it. It also shortens the time you can spend with other people!

**Excercise** - If you don't wanna lift weights or get into bodybuilding you can try to do some cardio or jogging or whatever. Just try to be physically active. Your mind has to focus at least partially on your body when you're active, and that means less time to focus on negative thoughts.

**Balanced diet** - My diet really sucked for years on end because I was a clueless student who used to get every meal made by my mother. These days I eat a big breakfast and usually 5 meals a day with a balanced intake of protein, carbs and fats. If you have no clue about nutrition, there are tons of forums out there dedicated to it. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a subreddit about it too.

**Socialize** - Avoiding people made me crazier than I had to be. At the end of the day, humans are social creatures and additionally, if you are a self hater like me, you really don't enjoy your own company. ",2,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/edn2s/my_way_out/,1291080111

About 4 months ago I got a prescription for Paroxetine, and while it's helping, I don't feel quite where I should. I'm terrified of posting this, letting anyone see what I'm feeling. I've erased this about 8 times and probably will again before committing to posting or giving up. My parents are very understanding, but I'm not sure how to communicate to my boyfriend that this is more serious than he understands. I am almost failing the majority of my classes, because it hurts too much to think many days, and I'd rather do anything else, like discover Reddit and browse for 7 hours straight. Honestly, I think I just need to tell someone all this, I have plenty of people to go to, but I know that it hurts them to see me in pain. God I'm rambling.

edoio,depression,Throwaway_3318,How to start getting help? Do I go public?,"Hey folks, I've been lurking for a while, I apologize in advance if this is a repeated set of questions.

I've gone from being a funny, creative hard worker to a sad, dull slacker.  It's just a matter of time before work gets backed up to the point of no return.  I can't see things doing anything other than spiraling down.  Suicide keeps creeping into my mind - why not punch my own time-card while I'm still fairly (44) young and healthy?

I have health insurance, anything I've tried to do myself clearly hasn't worked. Seems like the next step is obvious.

So; 

Who do I call first? Family doctor?

Who do I tell?  Who at work needs to know?  I'm not telling our HR guy at the local office - I'll deal with the home office if I have to.

Some friends and co-workers have begun to notice I'm unraveling.  Tell a white lie or come clean?  As soon as I tell anyone at work, word will get out - I have no illusions about that.

I'm not ashamed about seeking help.  I just want to keep my friends and job if possible.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

edxy8,depression,Anomolies,Need advice regarding meds and treatment resistant depression.,"A bit of background: I'm 19, have been miserable for as long as I can remember, and was diagnosed with clinical depression two years ago. Since that diagnosis, I've been in therapy and seeing psychiatrists (the first one was an awful fit). Through this treatment I've been on various drugs, with all of them either not working at all, having side effects that outweighed the marginal benefits, or quickly leveling off and leaving me where I started while still taking them. It's gotten to the point of my psychiatrist having me try Abilify (which I see as hail mary), which of course didn't work because it's an awful drug. I was told to stop taking said Abilify if it didn't start helping and to start a trial of Provigil instead. This is in addition to Welbutrin.  
  
  
Anyway, I have been feeling like absolute shit lately. Sleeping 13+ hours a day, not being able to focus on looming school deadlines, regular thinking of suicide. Worse than usual for me. Yesterday I started the Provigil. I'm awake and alert now, I was able to focus and get a ton of work done on a paper that has been stumping me, and most importantly I feel *good.* This is the first med I've taken that I see as actively helping. But it's expensive. Like $600 for a month expensive. As a student with a part time job, I can't afford that. My parents have been helping with all the mental illness related bills and they don't want to foot that bill. There's no generic equivalent either.     
  
  
Tl;dr the one med that has helped in two years of treatment is too expensive, I have one week of feeling normal before it runs out.

edyrx,depression,sinkingboat,"I'm on a sinking boat, and it's name is depression.","I feel like I am on a sinking ship. I feel like I'm going to drown and there is nothing I can do to save myself. I have no flotation device, no flare...I'm blaring a mayday over the airwaves and no one can hear me. I'm feeling as if there is no hope, and the only option is to suffer.

It's hard to be a logical person with depression. I feel like I have two aspects to myself. There is the logical, external version of me, and the emotional internal version of me. Logically, I know I have no reason to be depressed. Logically, I know I am not worthless, I know this is not hopeless, I know that this is just something I'm going through and it may pass. The thing is, I can't get my emotional side to match up with that. Even though I know things logically, I do not feel them internally. I'm struggling to be normal, struggling to keep my head above water, but I'm failing constantly. I can't shake the thoughts or feelings I have. I want so badly to be different, but I just can't translate that want into a tangible action. 

Lately, I've contemplated suicide...which I have never done before. I've had depression for the better part of my life. Sometimes treated, mostly untreated, and truth be told, I have a hard time caring. It seems as though there is no point to life. If I'm here to fuck around for 80 years and just be miserable...well...I don't want to do that. I've spent at least 10 years with depression, and all of my life being unhappy. I don't think I could go on for much longer. It's not that I want to die, it's just that I don't want to live. I see how committing suicide would be a little hard for some people like my mom and brother, who would more than likely be pretty upset. I feel like committing suicide isn't actually worth all the shit I'd have to do...but nonetheless, I'd rather be dead. What is going to come of all of this? Nothing. I get to be just like everyone else, still searching for a reason to be happy into my old age. Why deal with depression your whole life? At what point do you say enough is enough?

I'm half of a person. Depression has stolen my life from me. I'm taking responsibility for my own actions - it's nobody's fault other than mine that I developed depression and I'm now suffering. I know that depression isn't just some magical force that controls my life, and that my actions contribute the most to my life...but even then, I still feel like the depression has stolen something from me. It has, really. It's taken away the hope of a better tomorrow. It's taken away all of my dreams, it's taken my willpower, my self worth, everything. I feel nothing. I'm an empty shell. I can physically feel the emptiness. My stomach does not exist, my heart is not there...I'm just a bunch of meat and bone and nothing more than that.

I'm in a relationship and I don't even know why. I have no ability to feel. I see him, I love him...but I feel dead. I can't feel any love from him. I want to feel it, but I don't have the capacity. I crave more love, more affection...I want someone to told me and tell me I'm beautiful and that it will all be okay...but I can't get what I crave. Why even be with someone like me? What's the point? Of course you don't want to be affectionate with the person who is unresponsive. But my god, it doesn't mean to stop trying. I feel like I am begging and pleading, and I am being laughed at. I might feel better if he was more loving...at least for a little while. I'm so lonely I can barely breathe. I feel like I am a toy, like I am just something to fuck with and laugh it. I feel like he is standing on a rescue boat, watching me sink...watching me drown, and he is laughing. Throw me a line...do anything...I need you more than you will ever know. To him, I'm just some bitch to fuck when she's happy. If she's not happy, then screw that. I'm worth it to play house with, but not worth it to marry. I'm worth it to toy with, to lie to. ""Maybe we will marry"", ""but I have been saying no for years"", ""probably before you're 30"", ""never, accept it."" People love to fuck with me, to see my squirm. Even my own boyfriend would rather toy than me instead of being an actual caring human being. I'm worthy of a half-hearted ""I love you"", and not worth any real expression of emotion and support. I need real support, and I am coming up short. I know, he would be if I was more receptive...but for fuck's sake, I am depressed, what is not understood about that?! There is only so much I can do. I want to make it better, I really do, so much...but I just can't. I want him to understand. I need him to try because I have no way to keep my head above water. Clearly, I'm just an idiot. I mean, it's true, I'm a loser. I have a boyfriend of nearly 4 years who won't do anything to even humor me. I'm sitting, spilling my heart to the damn internet, hoping someone will really hear my words and will understand, and possibly throw me that line I so desperately need.
I am uttlerly alone. There are billions of people, but I'm still alone. I feel like I am screaming for help and people are looking right through me. I'm like the invisible bitch no one should care about. These feelings I have never go away. When I wake up, when I shower, when I make a sandwich, when I drive my car, when I go to school, when I watch TV, when I fall asleep....these feelings haunt me. I don't get to truly rest, and I don't know true happiness.

Thanks for reading my wall of text, and I hope you know it is grealy appreciated. It's nice to know that someone, somewhere out there, will read my post and will understand. I know this text was the overemotional writing of a depressed person, and these are just my feelings. I guess, maybe, that reality is much different.

ee1sv,depression,[deleted],"What's your ""depressed"" playlist?","Not to be a Debbie Downer, but what music do you listen to when you're depressed?  What songs describe how you feel inside when you can't find the words to describe it?  Are there any specific lines in the songs that speak the most to you? Music is a huge part of my life, it gets me through the bad times and entertains me in the good times.  Even though listening to my ""depressed"" playlist probably doesn't help with the depression, it at least gives me the feeling that I'm not alone and that other people also feel the way I do.

Here's a few songs that mean a lot to me, I'll try to post more as the day goes by, but I have to go to class in a bit.  

**Yellow Angels - Senses Fail**
 - The character in this song is having a car wreck.  Time is slowed down tremendously and the person realizes how much there is left to live for even though the beauty of the wreck is enticing to just let go.

**The Priest and the Matador - Senses Fail**

ee33q,depression,saywhat1081,Depression-only side of Bipolar?,"Hi all, my brother committed suicide (was bipolar) at age 32 back in the beginning of August.

Understandably the last few months have been horrible to say the least, and even though I have never been to a therapist or psychiatrist before, I have sought out professional help since then to help sort out my range of emotions. My general practioner for a long time had prescribed me Wellbutrin to help with my self-diagnosed bouts of depression, but upon hearing about my family history of bipolar depression (I have a parent and grandparent with the disorder - undiagnosed and self-medicating - in addition to my brother who had the disease), the psychiatrist determined that I have the depression-side of bipolar (different receptors than your typical unipolar depression, which is why the Wellbutrin wasn't helping, and why other typical SSRI's or AD's wouldn't have helped either).

Alas, he prescribed me Lamictal (Lamotrigine) to help with my depression, and said that most people who are bipolar never have a manic episode. I was too dazed with this ""bipolar"" diagnosis to ask him more questions, so I guess that's why I'm asking you guys.

Am I considered bipolar if I've never been manic? (He wrote down ""depression"" in my chart.) Or is it common for those diagnosed as bipolar to have never been manic? I'm sure I've had bouts of hypomania but definitely have never been manic (with psychotic breaks like my brother had). I've also never even contemplated suicide or been close to that point on the depression side. Does this sound like cyclothymia?

Anyway, I'll be seeing him again in 3 weeks and my therapist weekly until then, but was just curious in the meantime. Thanks in advance!",19,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ee33q/depressiononly_side_of_bipolar/,1291149190
ee7hl,depression,bernardvanburen,I just want to talk to a real live person.,"I am not doing so great. It became painfully obvious this thanksgiving when I couldn't hold a conversation with *anybody.* I ducked away into empty rooms just to avoid people. 

I've been lying. Saying I've had this job when I haven't yet. I might get it soon but its looking more and more unlikely. I've wasted so much time. I've been unemployed for more than six months now. I put all my eggs in this one basket (and its not even a great basket) and wasted other opportunities I could have had. 

I started lying just so I could get them off my back. But now I feel like they know that really I've just spent the last three months in this room I rent. I haven't left in three days. I feel like such a pest when I call to inquire about jobs I've applied for and interviewed for but nobody gives me a response. I know in actual reality I'm not doing anything unreasonable but in my head I've been obsessing about what to do next. Its really stressing me out. 

I wish there was a support group I could go to. I'm worried about my health too. Not just my mental health but I'm to afraid to go the doctor. And I know any pills they prescribe won't help if I don't take them. I feel so unattractive but I can't even afford a haircut. I don't even know where to start with all my worries. 

I do know that I don't feel comfortable reaching out to people I know. I feel I've already sabotaged my relationships too much just by not keeping in touch regularly. I know I wouldn't want to be called out of the blue for an old friend to complain all their problems to me. So why would I do that to them? 

I wear a thin mask that everything is ok but really under the surface I am just barely hanging on.",13,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ee7hl/i_just_want_to_talk_to_a_real_live_person/,1291164666
ee87v,depression,dnemer,"Why am I So Desperate? Please Help me, my life is falling apart.","I feel like the only reason I want to have a girlfriend is because I feel so lonely and depressed all the time.  I keep falling in love with every pretty girl I meet in college.  But I am really shy and medically depressed.  i suffer from panic attacks and that is connected to my depression which i have had for the past 2-3 years.   

I have come to the realization that finding ""love"" would not make me feel better and that I would never meet anyone if I continue to have low self-esteem and self-confidence in myself.  

All I want to do is learn simply to be happy on my own.  I want to have self-confidence and to have ""thick skin"" so I would no longer get hurt by what little things people say that make me feel socially awkward.  

How can I learn to find happiness when your alone.  I do not have many friends and I have trouble meeting new people.  I just want to forget about aspects like relationships and love and be happy alone.  

i am done wishing for self-confidence and positive attention.  It only makes me feel worse.  All I want to do is forget about it all, get that weight off my shoulders, and just love myself.  I do not know what that means or feels like but I suppose it is the best way to solving my life problem.

All I want is to be happy because I am worried that my college is going to advise me to take a ""Leave of Absense"" due to the fact that the school psychologists and teachers believe that I am on the verge of turning suicidal or something that I would be a danger to myself.  I do not know if I agree with them and I do not want to leave college after my first semester of my first year.  So I really need help.  I do not want to go back home.  It would be the ultimate failure for me.

eebx9,depression,throwawy10,"Weird thoughts, are these from depression?","So I have a history of depression which just sort of died down but never really went away, and I've always had problems with *getting things done*.  It's been the main concern in my life (I'm a college student now), this lack of discipline (which I'm sure is partially if not wholly due to depression).  I can't even get the things I want to do done (classic depression).

But lately I've been getting some more extreme symptoms, and I want to get your guys' take on it.  I want to know if you guys think it's just stronger depression, or if it's some other psychological disorder.  Because I feel like I'm losing my mind and a part of me is actually afraid that I WILL lose my mind.

So lately I've been getting these weird flashes of, um, ""lack of free will"".  It's sort of a weird almost meditative thing but it's really freaking me out.  It's like, my mind gets so overwhelmed with confusion, confused thoughts, and clouded perspectives that I'm almost disassociated and unconscious.  Like I'm just watching myself from a camera, but I'm no longer myself.

I can best sum it up with a couple of metaphors.

#1) I've been feeling like a rock, as far as motivation is concerned.  A rock can only be moved by something external, it can't move on its own.  Similarly, I feel like my actions are only guided by strong external forces (when I'm forced to do something), but I can't make decisions or do actions by myself.  I've lost any sort of internal driving force.  But more than that, the idea of an internal driving force is starting to seem impossible and illogical to me.  Like every action I do has to just be a reaction to the outside world.  I can't make myself do anything I want to do.
#2) It's like I'm no longer me, I'm just watching a character of me in a movie.  When I have to make a decision (whether I'm going to go to the gym or not), I can hope that the character will decide to do it.  I can ROOT for him.  But in the end, I have no control over whether it happens or not.  It just does, or it doesn't.

I'm worried because it feels like I'm losing my grip on reality as well as ""self"".",6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eebx9/weird_thoughts_are_these_from_depression/,1291181346

ef9iz,depression,is_anybody_out_there,"Reddit, I don't give a fuck about anything, Can anyone help me?","Reddit I think I am depressed, lately the monotony of the life I've been living has really stripped away the passion and emotion out of my life.  I've been working 40+ hours, 6 days a week, as assistant manager of grocery department at a grocery store then going to classes for 3 hours a day, 4 days out of those 6.  I feel so trapped, every single thing I do I say to myself, ""Whats the point?""  Even as I type this I have no motivation to let the world know my situation but I'm doing it anyways.  

Every fucking day is awful monotony. I wake up at some ungodly hour (usually around 6 or 7 am) 6 days a week and rush to work, then my boss usually greets me with a ""This is everything you've been doing wrong"" speech, I always smile and nod and then contemplate jumping into the trash compactor, usually more than once a day. I spend the next 9 hours pissed off doing hard work. Once I finally punch out I have about 30 seconds to smile and breathe before I get in my car, and drive 45 minutes to my local community college, sit through a 90 minute class that I don't give a single fuck about and drive home. For those doing the math, I leave my house before 7am and arrive back after 9pm most days. 

I have no real social life to speak of, because of my lack of available time, or the fact all my real friends are off at college. Even when I arrive home I am greeted by a houseful of 5 other people which, quite frankly, I don't like very much. They are my family and I know they love me but I can't be bothered to talk to them anymore.  They bother the fuck out of me every single day, always when I want nothing more than peace and quite, something I don't see more than once a week if I'm lucky. My only quite time is when I smoke weed late at night, which is literally the only thing I have to look forward to every day.  I think I am a drug addict.  Its not the drug you use but how you use it.  I've been smoking for almost 4 years but the last 3 months have been getting progressivly bad.  I started off getting high at home and playing xbox, watching tv, and jamming to tunes, I loved it.  I liked getting high more by myself because I wanted to do what I wanted to do.  Then it turned into a habit, I'd always blaze before bed.  The past 3 months I have been getting high for no purpose other than to escape reality for as long as I can during my night. I vape weed until my head spins and I do nothing but lie face first on my floor and drool.  Literally.  I sometimes couple that with a beer and some nicotine and really spin hard.  Then like clockwork I wake up in the morning on my floor pissed off that I woke up.  Then my first thought is always ""Man only 14 more hours until I can rip the vape and lose myself again.  *sigh*

Between the hours of 12am and 6 am, my only hours to sleep, I am awaken on average of 2 times a night by a crying 5 month old. I have no girlfriend, I don't have my own car, I don't have any ambition in school, I don't have the funds to support myself or move out of my house, I don't have time to pursue hobbies, nor go out and try to meet women. I don't feel depressed in a traditional sense and never have, because I am not feeling sad and I never cry, but I think about killing myself often like its no big deal. Like ""If I had a gun right now I'd shoot myself without a second thought, what do I have to lose?"" I have thought about talking with a psychologist, but do not have the time nor the motivation.  I always look forward to my days off but didn't even get out of bed today, leading me to ask for help. 

Coupling my current living situation with the fact that I am very introverted and have moderate social anxiety, I don't see an end in sight.  I have dreams and things I want to do but I feel like my feet are on sticky fly paper at the moment, and I'm making no progress.  I feel like I can easily get a girl if I wanted to, I have a few that want me, but I don't wanna drag them down with me, that'd really be quite selfish.",7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ef9iz/reddit_i_dont_give_a_fuck_about_anything_can/,1291328681

efq3x,depression,hive_mind,Is happiness a lie?,"I'm 17 years old, and I've been struggling with depression for about a month. I've had anxiety about death, as an atheist, ever since I was in middle school. Watching documentaries about cosmology, evolution, and science in general convinced me that life is meaningless. I used to have panic attacks infrequently as I tried to go to sleep, but they would pass fairly quickly. They basically consisted of fear about my parent's death, and then fear about my own death. I know it's irrational to fear something as remote as heat death, but the inevitability of everything said to me that humans, and consciousness is just a consequence of evolution. I usually pissed myself and then fell asleep at some point. I always assumed growing up or time would give me some answer/closure. A couple months ago, after graduating high school, a friend offered me some marijuana. At first, it was a wonderful experience, but after a couple months, I started losing my appetite and becoming dependent on cannabis to function normally. One day, I had a complete breakdown and I began crying and crying, as I was overwhelmed with thoughts about the meaningless of life, how everything is completely arbitrary and there is no reason why; it just is this way. I called my mother and asked her to pick me up from college (she thought it had something to do with my grandfather's death, which happened about 2 months ago). On the way home, she tried to comfort me and tell me that there is meaning in life. She is a Hindu, but she is very open-minded. Nonetheless, in our conversation the obstacle we kept bumping against was that she believed consciousness cannot be destroyed, whereas I believe and am terrified of the fact that consciousness can be created and destroyed. She took very good care of me, suggesting books that might help me change my outlook towards life. I tried many things, but none of them seemed to help me deal with the inevitability of death. I have debilitating panic attacks that prevent me from leaving bed or even eating, as there is no purpose to life. I believe that consciousness is something that is simply a result of evolution, and that one day, my consciousness will cease to exist, and any actions I take mean nothing simply because there is no such thing as meaning. I tried to look at myself objectively, and why I was not happy. Happy people, I think, are happy because they believe that in the future there is more happiness. But at some point, there ceases to be a future for people, and that, I think, is what is preventing me from being happy. It doesn't matter whether or not I learn to be happy, because nothing matters. Many atheists say that they find meaning in life despite their belief in god, but that just seems like another lie that they tell themselves. I don't wish to offend anybody, but that is simply the only thing that I can think right now.

efqj0,depression,messy_jen,The Worst Year of My Life,"Dear Reddit

2010 sucked so hard. I am amazed I'm even still functioning at all. Some days I'm kinda not.

In January our house burnt down. Early morning fire, we were asleep, everyone got out except me - I was trapped. Took forever for the firemen to arrive because we lived way out in BFE. I was nearly unconscious by the time they got me out. We lost everything. Most horrific ordeal of my life, up to that point.

In July my husband died. I came home at about 12:45 pm and found him dead, still sitting up in his computer chair. A Reddit window was open....along with a few others. Autopsy showed heart failure from atheroscleroptic coronary artery disease (clogged arteries). He was 45 years old.

The past 4 months have been a nightmarish blur. Sometimes I forget he's gone and I grab my phone to send him a text, or think, ""I need to call and tell him...."" I want to talk to him; there are so many things I want to tell him, so many things on Reddit I see and think, ""He would have loved this."" Half of our conversations started with, ""Hey did you see that post on Reddit about..."" I go back and read old emails we sent to each other and I both laugh and cry.  I miss him so fucking bad that can't stand it at times and I think I will go insane from the feeling.

Sometimes I think I'm ready to give dating a try just to have someone to talk to and hang out with, but then something inside of me shrivels up in revulsion and screams NOOO.  My husband was a brilliant, genius of a man who could hold an indepth conversation on everything from the physics involved in the LHC to how to make toast. His pursuit for knowledge was endless. When I consider other men, all I can think of is, they're all morons compared to him. 

I know this sounds corny but, he was my rock. When I'd get flighty or have ridiculous ideas, he'd sit here and listen, with a certain ""Jen's got another crazy idea!"" gleam in his eye and a half-cocked smile, and then calmly and rationally talk me down and explain to me why this or that would not work or was a bad idea. Or, if it were a good idea, I could see the wheels turning in his head and he'd say, ""you know...we could to (this or that)..."" and we'd sit up for hours hatching new, brilliant plans for taking over the world. This is going to sound really arrogant, but here it is - when we started getting serious after dating, he told me that he'd dated a lot of girls but was waiting to find one as intelligent as him to mix dna with and have a kid. We got pregnant 4 months later. We had 15 years of shared history, inside jokes,  catch phrases and body language. All gone. Just POOF... gone. I now understand when someone says they feel empty inside. I feel like a zombie, like every day it's a struggle just to drag my ass out of bed and throw my robe on.

I am blessed with a wonderful family, and three good kids and for that I am thankful. But they're not him. And when they piss me off at times...who do I have to talk to about it? No one. I don't really have many friends because I was content to hang out with him 24/7. He was my best friend, my soulmate.

Lately I've been having some pretty horrific nightmares, about him and about the fire. I have a new house, thanks to the insurance money, and I wake up in the middle of the night, absolutely positive the house is on fire. I can feel the heat, smell the smoke, and my vision is clouded, and I'm overcome with an insane feeling of GOTTA GET THE HELL OUT!!! It takes a minute or two before I realize it's not real. I'm absolutely paranoid about the furnace, cooking, even lighting a candle. And fuck campfires. The smell makes me nauseous.

The dreams I have about him are just as bad as the fire dreams and far more upsetting. I wake up crying, often.

I would never consider killing myself, but I feel like if I keeled over dead, that'd be fine with me. I don't believe in god or heaven or hell, but I keep thinking that if I knew he was somewhere waiting on me, I'd much rather be there with him than here. 

Everyone tells me, ""OMG you are so strong!!!"" Fuck that. I am tired of being strong. And they don't know what's going on in my head, how miserably sad I am and how tired I am of *just surviving*.

I had a first appointment with a psychologist two days ago. It was preliminary stuff and I gave her a brief overview. Even she was speechless when I told her what has happened to me this year. She said based on what she's heard so far, definitely major depressive disorder and PTSD. I go back in a week. I'm not real convinced it's going to help. At this point I don't think anything will.

Sorry for the lengthy post. Maybe someone here will read it and realize their life isn't so bad after all.

tl;dr - my house burned down and 6 months later my husband died. FML.

I was prescribed Effexor XR, and I'm continuing counseling, but I am a bit worried about the medication. I've never taken an antidepressant before, so I'm not completely sure what to expect. I have read some horror stories about the withdrawal symptoms, etc., but I know there are some good stories out there as well.

eg1i7,depression,Suprisemoose,Trying to figure out why I feel depressed...,"Have you ever realized that there is nothing you want, that you have gotten everything which you have desired. The very same things which you understood would bring happiness has brought you nothing but indifference. You have loved ones, family, any material item you could dream of and yet you remain unhappy, why? You see I have realized that I have tried to pretend that something specific is causing, what may or may not be depression. I might be projecting depression, self consciencly because I want attention, I need to know what ails me or I just can’t grasp a hold of life. It could be that I spend my Fridays by myself, but is there a reason I keep pushing away people who want to be friendly. I am that self conscience or conceded. Maybe my depression is derived from not having any true passion. Video games are fun, but I wouldn’t truly care if my Xbox broke, water polo is fun but it’s not really a passion nor can I think of a way to make it so. I tried guitar, skateboarding, video making, computers, photography, writing, and well I enjoyed each but never felt any desire to continue. I guess I just don’t know who I am. Am I a nerd? Am I awkward? Am I funny? A jerk? Invisible? Weird? Somewhat popular? I cant figure out who I am, its not like tv where you realize you have a passion or talent in something, I know I need to work at being what I want myself to be. Everyone says to be yourself, I don’t know what that is. You could say I’m lonely, I’m a pestimist or that I need to find something that I can relate to. One option to help myself that I thought would work would be getting a girlfriend. But after I thought of this I cant help but think even if I did ask a girl out/to a dance, who’s to say that it wasn’t a pity ‘yes’, because that I cant handle, but if it was a ‘no’ I would probably go spiraling down. This I guess is much like an inferiority complex. Maybe my problem is not that I don’t know what I want it’s that I don’t want to take the risk for fear of failure or worse undeserved success. I want to say I have the perfect life, which I should because I live in great house in a great neighborhood, in a beautiful town in the greatest part of the best state; I go to probably the most stunning highschools for miles around, with amazing teachers you can’t find anywhere else. My friends are great, at least I think they are, they always are nice and considerate, that’s not to say we don’t goof around and make fun of eachother, but they are amazing friends. I have a great family, who very rarely fight, we all truly love each other, I am blessed. We are very well off, I have never heard any talks of money trouble, in fact I’m typing this on my personal 2300 dollar macbook. I should be grateful, and I am but no matter how many times I count my blessings, I continue to feel depressed. I don’t know if my mind is pretending to be depressed because I want to be a part of things that I;m not and I use it as a crutch. Or maybe I am depressed, but I can’t think of any reason as to why or howi could be depressed, how is it that in the media everyone with depression is depicted as having a reason, bully, abusive family, poverty, or life trauma. I have never had to deal with any of this and yet im miserable. I try to change my lifestyle because I keep thinking that maybe that will kickstart my motivation to do well anything. I feel no desire anymore to go hang out with friends, not like I truly ever have though, I spend my time watching tv and messing around on the computer, doing absolutely nothing. Part of the reason im depressed is I know I should be happy but I can’t seem to make myself be happy at all. I have depression. But hey who’s gonna listen, everyone will. I’m surrounded by those who love me, and im sure that anyone of them would take time out of their day to listen and help, but what do I tell them exactly im depressed, but I cant tell you why. Youre probably thinking why my family and friends haven’t noticed my depression, well I don’t let my grade slip mostly because I want to please those that have given me so much, but I truly have no motivation at all anymore and if you looked closely at my grades you could tell that in fact that non motivation is actually showing. I find myself wondering that if I killed myself would people notice or care, even if they did would it be genuine or would it be so as to not be a jerk, in my imagination, which I thought I could control it seems that only those that were really close to me cared as well as others who begin crying for the attention, even if they don’t themselves. Sometimes it’s not even me killing myself sometimes it’s just I died of heart attack or something. Maybe the reason I never thought I was depressed was because I thought I was sad that I wasn’t popular, but maybe I was depressed because I’m lonely, some of my closest friends have stopped hanging out with me and my other friends aren’t really more than eat lunch with, copy homework friends. Right now I probably have two close real friends and five others. Maybe im just sad that life is passing me by while I waste time alone watching tv. I find myself pondering how much weight the ceiling lamp can hold, the height of my closet , the circumference of my head or what the principal would say on the announcements at school if I indeed went through with it, which I won’t seriously, but I get depressed each time I realize that Im thinking these things because I know it will hurt my family if I did it, and sadly that’s the only reason I can think of but its enough to prevent me from even seriously considering it. My family probably has no idea that I feel this, I act happy around them, but I rarely am truly happy. I don’t enjoy lying but again I don’t what else to do. Sleep is my safe haven, it’s just me and my thoughts, nothing else. I wish could sleep more, but since I feel no motivation to complete even the simplest of tasks I end up staying up late often, it may be leading to insomnia. I don’t know, you see ive looked up symptoms of depression and I might have it but then I go onthinking that oh wait maybe im just thinking that because I read it here, or im misinterpreting to make myself fit the mold.

eg1wk,depression,arorke123,friendships affected by depression/anxiety?,"i've never been in a real relationship so what i have real experience in are friendships, and i take them very seriously.

i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was young, and i never realized anything was really wrong until it had an affect on other people. i'll never forget being in 6th grade, on the phone with my best friend at the time who had been since 2nd grade, and she told me she didnt think we should be friends anymore because i was always complaining about everything. i knew what she was talking about. i was paranoid about everything and apparently i was a real negative 12 year old. i cried and tried to get her to change her mind, but that was it. i lost my first friend.

the rest of middle school was a blur and the friends i made then managed to embrace my weirdness, so i'll skip that time.

in high school i was in a special honors program where i was in the same classes everyday with about the same 20 people. this was for all four year, so inevitably a lot of us became close friends. somethign happened junior year which caused me to believe that all my friends were plotting against me- basically something was planned with a person that i wasnt friends with but they were, and i was conspicuously not invited. basically my group of friends were gunna all go to prom together as a group, meet somewhere first, then all go to that girls hosue afterwards. at the last minute it came to my attention that i wasnt invited to this, and none of my friends chose to talk that girl into letting me join them. long story short, my friends werent sticking up for me and sneaking around behind my back. i confronted them but they acted like they didnt know what i was tlaking about. whatever.

ever since then i was very paranoid about everything. i always assumed someone was talking about me behind my back, or that they were making plans without me, or that they were making fun of me right in front of my face if someone made an inside joke that i didnt understand. everyone in this group would talk about someone if they werent there. this made my paranoia even worse. i always thought somethign was up, or they were plotting against me behind my back, and my paranoia started to become noticeable to them. we did a lot of fun things together so i tried to believe that those good things made up for it all.

there were a lot of times where my friends were outright mean to me too.

they knew i was crazy. they knew about my anxiety and depression and how i went to therapy. a couple of my friends cut themselves so they were the ones that got sympathy.

if i was having a tough day with depression, and ti was noticeable, i was crying in school etc, my friends would just avoid me and not try to make me feel better.

finally, somthing happened back in may (the end of my college freshman year) that was the last straw and i decided to cut ties with these people. i couldnt stand being ""friends"" with them anymore because all they did was talk abotu each other behind their backs and iknew i was one of the victims.

i felt better after letting them go. i had other friends who were so much better and made me feel good about myself.

now i have new friends that i feel i cant open up to because im afraid theyll think im weird and try to avoid me liek the others did. right now i live with one of my friends (in theory) and she knows i take medication but i havent really talked ablout it much with her. i cant bring myself to talk to people about my problems, itll scare them away.

eg34n,depression,radeky,"2 friends have told me they're seriously depressed, even suicidal.  In 72 hours.","So,

I have 2 friends, both female, both around age 23 have both told me this week that they are potentially suicidal.  One, lets call her Bridget (not her name) told me Tuesday over dinner.  My other friend, lets call her Joanne (also not her name) told me tonight after we saw a movie together and after I asked her about what last monday night was about(I'll get to that later).

I'll try to keep this short, but I want to get some information out there to hopefully get some advice as to how to react/handle this.  Maybe this should go into Advice, but really its about dealing with friend's depression.

I have very few very close friends.  I am close to both of these friends and would have an extremely hard time coping with the loss of either one of them.

Both of them are having an extremely hard time making ends meet.  Bridget has told me that she might lose her job as new owners might soon take over her work.  Joanne told me that due to a past medical bill related to a hospital stay related to depression, her already miniscule wages are now about to be garnished.  I am less worried about ""Bridget"" since she has a family that has the ability to take her back in and support her if necessary, however it would require relocating back to Montana.

""Joanne"" I am seriously concerned about.  This conversation started because I asked her what happened last monday (we fooled around pretty seriously and we've dated before).  She told me that while she likes me, she doesn't want to drag me down into her shit.  Nor does she want to start a relationship if she thinks she'll be gone in a few months.  She's talked about suicide with me before, but she seems more insistent that she'll give up soon than ever before.  She believes that her life will never get better, that she's to fully blame for her lack of funds, lack of work, lack of friends, failed relationships, etc.  As we talked tonight, I tried to reassure her that its not all her fault.  I worked to remind her that not everything is her fault.  She's not being fired from jobs, just not finding new ones (no one is).  She's not being given hours because there aren't hours to give.  That she's already put herself through college (albeit with student loans) without support from her family.  She is still concerned that with the amount of debt she's accrued, it will take several years to dig herself out of it.. if she's even successful at all.  Most of the time I stood there and listened.  That was the best I could do.

I've dealt with depression myself, I've even tried to kill myself twice.  I always hated when people told me ""things will look up.  Things will get better.""  Or ""Dont kill yourself, you'll be missed.""  I do my best to stay away from that line of thinking and try to work on tangibles.  Things that I can point to and go, ""This.  This is why life is worth living.""  However, its extremely difficult to come up with those things and ensure that they won't backfire.

Thoughts?

TL;DR, Two friends have told me they're suicidal/severely depressed.  I believe it to be mostly situational.  I've been romantically involved with one.  I care about both a great deal.

2. Alien chestburster parasites. And all the flame-throwers were out of fuel.

3. Being picked up out of my home and forced to move somewhere else, leaving everything I love behind.

eg8yb,depression,[deleted],"Lazy, depressed, or a combination of both?","My boyfriend just started talking antidepressants but we're not sure of its effects at this point (started two days ago).

A reoccurring question I've been having is whether his state is due to a combination of apathy/laziness and/or depression. i.e. Did he become depressed and stop caring about the little things? I noticed he seldom does any chores around the house even though he's home most of the time.

I've done some reading regarding the issue and it seems that when you're depressed, nothing seems to be worth doing, then you end up feeling shitty about being ""lazy"" and exacerbating the depression.

He's also started smoking weed regularly. I'm ok with recreational use but it makes me uncomfortable to come home and he's high more often then not and lies about its use. We've discussed this, and I realize he feels shitty and pot makes him feel better, but it seems he's on the road to getting better (meds, talking, planning goals) but sabotaging it by using another drug to self-medicate. Prior to this he had used alcohol, which was much more detrimental. How is this in the short-term, long-term? 

I should also mention I started smoking cigs again when I learned of his depression. I feel responsible for him starting to smoke pot more. I wasn't strong enough to not smoke, which might make him think smoking something (pot) is an acceptable coping mechanism.

Someone could be telling me about themselves and I might be able to come up with some follow up questions to ask but my brain doesn't seem to work fast enough to come up with something else other then ""yeah"", ""right"", ""i see"" which causes the conversation to die quickly.

Not having ever been under any real depression myself, I feel like I really can't relate and I wish I knew what she was going through and thinking.  It doesn't help that I'm an introvert who's never felt comfortable asking for help for any reason.  I feel like anything I say is the wrong thing and will upset her more.  I tried asking if there was anything I could do or if there was anything she wanted to talk about and neither of those got a positive response.  I told her that I'm here for her earlier and that seemed to help a bit.  I know ""It will get better"" doesn't work, because right now is what's important. 

I've been trying to figure out the right thing to say for the past 4 years or so and I havn't gotten very far.  If I'm lucky, I'll be able to get her to talk about what's on her mind; otherwise I get general answers and she'll say that ""everything"" is wrong and I'll have a hard time figuring it out.

I used to solve this dissonance by cutting myself, bringing myself back to reality, bringing the experience out, there is no right idea of why I did it.  I haven't done this for years now, but the desire has not grown smaller in any way.  It is only momentum that keeps me from doing it, and thank goodness for that.  But, I just feel like tearing myself out of my body and I can't sate this need with anything but time and repeating the lie that I am OK.  

Whenever I talk to people and read people talking about their experiences with depression, I can never see this.  This unwieldy self-destructive insanity.  The duality of vibrant emotional innards and a cold, logical exterior. Am I misdiagnosed? Do other people feel this wildness inside them?  Am I inhuman?  Am I too human?  Can someone please tell me they too want to crawl under the table to hide from the abusive creature inside them?  Is everyone else's experience of depression so close to the dictionary definition of the word - a damper on their experience of everything around themselves?  Don't misunderstand; I, too, have moments of calm depression where I can make a simple mistake and berate myself and just curl up and cry.  But this feeling is different, almost, though not quite, negatively manic.  Am I the only who has any idea of what I am trying to communicate?  

Oh, I apologize for coming back here instead of going to my therapist.  But, for the first, these feelings are so impossible to communicate even in writing that I physically cannot do so in therapy.  And, for the second, I just need to hear that I am not the only one that feels this way.  I mustn't be, there are nearly seven billion people in the world, please tell me I am not that psychotically unique.  

Last time I spilled my guts on reddit I received a quickly deleted comment more or less suggesting the selfishness of taking up space with my ravings. (For all I know it was done with kind intentions, though my frame of mind the time did not help me to see it as such.) I truly do apologize for being so attention-grabbing, but I need it.  Damn, that is hard to say. Please forgive my need to be selfish and exhibitionist.  

In any case, tl;dr: Does anybody else feel passionately insane when depressed? Please?",22,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/egoyw/does_anybody_else_feel_passionately_insane_when/,1291584464
egthp,depression,epadafunk,Feeling depressed suddenly,"All of a sudden this evening I'm feeling many symptoms of depression that I haven't felt in a long time.  My eyes are heavy.  I feel like I want to do something, but everything I try becomes boring after less than 5 minutes.  My energy level has gone way down in a span of about an hour, and I feel like I'm where I was the last time I felt depressed (that was over a year ago, and lasted for a few months) but then it took months for the symptoms to develop.  I'm trying to think of what could have brought this on, and the only thing that stands out is my Christmas present shopping excursion earlier today.

I felt fine all morning, took a shower, procrastinated around a bit, and finally headed downtown to do some christmas shopping.  I found really great books for my mom and dad, and thought I had found great books for my secret santa giftee and my girlfriend.  My whole list, done!  Well, I get home and actually open up the books that I bought.  This is where the trouble started.  The books I got for my parents were great, but the book I got for my girlfriend, which I thought was going to be an interesting scientific exploration of the reasons people overshop (she's into that kind of thing) turns out to just be a self help book for compulsive over spenders.  There's 7 bucks wasted.  The last book I got for my secret santa giftee I thought was going to be an interesting history of Vermont, but I've since read a few pages of the introduction and have discovered that it's some dry tome about tourism in Vermont that I think will bore anyone out of their minds to read.  

These two things are the only bad things that have happened to me today, and I can't imagine that they explain how i'm feeling, though I can't imagine that anything else would, as my feelings started right after I realized that these purchases were not what I thought they were going to be.  

So, can anyone help me figure out what happened?  I'm sure you'll need more info to help me figure this out, so ask away and i'll do my best to answer.  

Thanks in advance!

egu15,depression,MasterPorky,I am insignificant. I am desolate. I am anonymous.,"Reddit, I feel very unimportant as of right now. I feel absolutely insignificant, to the point where I have absolutely no desire to do anything or be around human beings at all. My lights are off, and my computer's monitor is on its lowest brightness, and my ""Depression"" playlist is playing very softly right now (currently on Radiohead's Street Spirit). This family is too loud, too bright. They don't even bother coming up and checking on me anymore, knowing I'll be either asleep or too reclusive to come do anything. It's both relieving and depressing. I've been hauled up here all weekend, Friday night to this very moment, by choice. I leave my room only at the latest hours of night, when I know everyone else is asleep. Tomorrow it's off to school, the prime source of my feelings of insignificance. Off to make another excuse for that paper I didn't care to do because I don;t care whether it's done or not. It's my senior year of high school and I can't wait to get out. Get away from the girl who when I oh-so-confidently asked out last week said nothing. My friends, whom I consider to be close, never see me outside of school unless I make extensive plans. The friends who only call me over when they know I have weed. My friends. My ""friends"". What a joke. 

I feel like wearing a mask and covering myself with a veil. Never speaking again. Becoming invisible, anonymous. 

...I posted a Facebook status, simply saying ""Is There Anybody Out There?"", one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs and also a subtle cry for help. A girl I would consider one of my best friends replied, ""nope."" I know it was probably a joke, but I laughed at the irony of her answer and how well it indicated what I felt about her and everyone else.",8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/egu15/i_am_insignificant_i_am_desolate_i_am_anonymous/,1291606057
egu3t,depression,Theworldisfdup,I need help. ,"I can't take things anymore, although I think about suicide, I don't think I will ever do it.

Things have just been so terrible and I don't know how to fix them. I have been spiraling down for literally years, almost a decade (and I've yet to even turn 20). I didn't see things getting worse and worse every year, Ive just started to notice it more and more. Things started to get exponentially worse my junior year of high school. 

And now these past few months in college have been worse than ever. I've completely screwing up. My 3.7 GPA will probably be cut in half. 

Aside from my neglectful behavior with my responsibilities at school, my behavior with other responsibilities is hideous. I want to crawl under a rock and sleep forever. My anxiety causes me to freak out when things are messy but when I am really anxious and stressed, the depression (caused from my anxiety) makes me shutdown. I can barely take care of my room/clothes/apt. If it wasn't for my significant other, I don't know what I'd do. but even in terms of him, I feel like shit when I think about it. I treat him like complete crap sometimes. I go off on rants and have childish fits that I can't even control. I feel terrible and constantly think he is going to wake up one day and just tell me he can't take the crap and break up with me. He's the only thing keeping me sane and able to do things. 

I have been crying out for help and no one seems to be listening. I go to counseling but they only had room for me ONCE A MONTH! I need something for than that. After one visit (I have only been there twice, and this coming week will be my third time this semester), they told me I should take medication. I didn't feel very comfortable with their solutions. They were willing to give me medication after only seeing me for 40 minutes and they seemed fine with not having at least weekly updates about how the medication is working. 
I turned their offer down. 
It just made me more anxious and stressed to think that perhaps the medication would make me worse and push my depression and suicidal thoughts to the edge and when that would happen I would have no one to turn to for weeks and probably commit suicide during that time I have to spend waiting for a fucking counselor to talk to. 

I also have constant headaches, neck and upper-back pain that is exacerbated by almost everything I do. Trying to work out is just a nightmare. I thoroughly detest my doctors solution to take tylenol when I have those pains. It solves nothing, the pain is just back later. I've had blood work done and everything is normal so they say it has to do with my stress.

So after freaking out all day and being completely stressed and not wanted to do anything and not being able to focus on a single thought, I will try to go to sleep. First, I should point out I have no idea how to sleep unless I am utterly exhausted. If I am not just dead tired, my mind just rambles on (like it does all day, writing a book about my stresses and about all the things I am listing I need to do that will never get done.) and these rambles make it impossible for me to go to sleep quickly. Lately though, I have found out I fall asleep much quicker on my couch (ironic considering it is quite uncomfortable to sleep on compared to my bed). So to help fall asleep, I play back some story in my head that will keep it focused enough on one subject to let me pass out for some time.

But even once I sleep, I don't have the most pleasant sleep anyway. I literally dream about death all the time. I literally cannot remember the last time I had a happy dream. Just in the past couple weeks I've dreamed I was being shot in the head on more than one occasion. I dreamed I was blown up, bombed, gassed, poisoned, chased off a building, run over by a car, chased and killed by wild animals, and shot in various other places on my body. Those are just to name a few, there tend to be more than one thing happening to me throughout the night. Then, in there even more terrifying dreams, my family members and other people who mean a lot to me are being killed and dying for various reasons. 
I wake up sweating with my heart racing. My forehead is constantly in a tense position. I have fine lines from where the creases of my skin are.

What the hell do I do?? No one wants to listen. I try to get help and no one offers reasonable help. I cannot face my parents with this news. And its going to unfold quickly after my failure of this semester. What do I do? How do I help myself and how to I stop hurting my s/o? How do I face all my teachers and peers and the reality of what my life has become?",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/egu3t/i_need_help/,1291606381

eh2hz,depression,NotMadJustDepressed,I'd like some advice,"Hi there. I've been on medication for the last three years on and off. The depression usually starts around this time of year and I get new meds from the doc around Jan/Feb when I can't take it anymore. Then I ween myself off them by August.

This year I wanted to break that. I've been running which has beaten the effects of meds by miles but now I've hit a major injury. I've been out for 2 months and have months more rehab in front of me. And now the fear, the paranoia, the self-loathing and all the other things are hitting me hard.

So... I have half the meds from earlier this year and a prescription for another months worth. 

I don't know whether it's admitting defeat to start up on the meds again or if it's for the best until I can exercise again and up the serotonin levels.

Or is there a third way I can't think of in this state?

eh5w4,depression,ThereUsedtoBeHope,Every Year I Hate Myself More,"Things used to be bad in High School.  My parents were divorced and my mom was an alcoholic and my dad was always traveling so I just watched a lot of TV and played a lot of videogames with no real good friends.

Then I thought college would be better, but I ended up getting tons of anxiety, not knowing what I wanted to do or why I was there in the first place.  I also got sick very frequently getting bronchitis three times in one year which made it hard to get to classes and get all my work done.  I didn't meet very many people, or didn't meet many people who liked me.  I finally graduated with a major I have no interest in and with very few contacts or friends from college.  

I never know if I really have friends.  I don't think I do.  I know people, but they don't call me and don't seem to care if I am around or not.  I could be dead and I wouldn't have any impact on anyone's life.  It hurts because I like to be there for people and I love to talk and see people and I feel really good when it truly feels like someone enjoys my presence but that never seems to happen.  

I'm 26 and I've been single basically my whole life aside from some dates.  What makes it harder to deal with is I've always felt like I'm in decent shape (even if not necessarily attractive), I'm tall, I try to be informed and I think I'm intelligent but that generally doesn't seem to matter.  I think regardless of anything else the fact that I hate myself and the anxiety stands that.  

Also the older I get, the more horrible things I see and find out people have done.  It's like every year I hear more and more things that make me shocked at how horrible people can be.  Everything seems so bleak.  I just wish things were good and positive and awesome but darkness or stupidity seems to crawl from every corner.

I'm currently stuck north in the snow and cold and I hate it.  I would like to move but am worried I wouldn't be able to find a job if I did.  I lose a desire to go outside or do anything as I just want to be warm and free from physical and mental pain.

eh699,depression,depressedthrowaway2,So Damn Sad and Frustrated,"So, this is a throw away for reasons that will become obvious.

So almost a year and a half ago I started an LDR with a girl I met online.

Big mistake, I know everyone will say some crap about how stupid this is, but, it was after we had been talking on the phone for awhile, I knew she was a girl, what she looked like, we video chatted, etcetera.

Anyways, so basically I go to a boarding school, it's about 300 kids, I know most of them.

I am a 17 year old Senior, as a notice.

But basically, it's not like I'd get a date here anyways, because hockey is basically a religion here and I don't like it.

And I'm the only ""nerd"" on campus, there are other people who are way better at math and science then I am, I'm fairly decent at reading and writing. (This post aside but hey it's a semi/full-rant)

I mean, everyone wants someone with similar interests, and in terms of interests, I'm kind of a jack of all nerds, not really amazing knowledgeable about any particular thing, but I know a lot about various things.

Video Games, Comics, Anime/Manga, Books, D&amp;D, Writing Stories/Poetry, Acting, all that jazz.

I mean, my best friend here is the closest thing to a nerd as well, and I mean, unless I'm using ""nerd"", incorrectly, I'm not anti-social.
I always try to ask people whats wrong, cheer people up when they are sad, help others, and try to make friends with as many people as possible.
And I'm not ugly either, not really hot either, just kind of average.

So I don't really know how I would attract someone, or be able to win someone's heart here, nor would it really work out as different interests.

Anyways, so we've been dating awhile, recently though he hasn't called or talked as often (she just got into college) and has said
she has been having a tough time and lots of work, so I try to be understanding, but she almost never calls, and even agrees with me
that we don;t talk as much as we used to.

So now the other day she tells me she wants to (act as if we were just friends again) and talk about nerdy things as if we were friends, because she has ""lost the spark""
and isn't sure if she loves me any more, or why she did in the first place, now I still love her, but now I'm vibrating between two stances.

Either A: ""I love you so much that I'll keep on loving you until you love me back"" Then try to make it work

or B: ""I Love, and have for this past one and a half years, and now you all of a sudden don't love me? I still love you, but
I'm not going to stay in a relationship with someone I love but who doesn't love me back"" Then break-up. (Insert obligatory Delete from facebook, get a lawyer, hit the gym)



But that's not all.

In addition, my Dad is still looking for a job after two years, my Mom is going crazy.
And my brother is a dick, so I can't really rely/get support from my family.
Except maybe my dad.

Even still, no matter how hard I try at school, I never seem to be able to do well at anything, I have a 3.56, Gpa or just about
and yet it seems like no matter what I do, I'm never as good as anyone else, and maybe I shouldn't worry about that as this quarters grades won't be looked at until after I'm accepted or rejected
to college, but whatever.


Oh and on theater, our new director is really cool, he's new this year, and after working as stage manager past season (which was actual work, our director prides on trying to run our plays like professional ones)
And so basically this season I'm a puppeteer of the main villain in the musical, and my best friend is the voice.

Now I love my best friend to death, but I feel like when the play is over, I'll get no recognition of my effort for the play, as everyone will have heard his voice and he is more popular than I.
Let me get this straight, I don't hold it against my friend, he is awesome, it's just, even thought I don't do acting for the attention, it is nice to feel like people did appreciate your effort.
And as stage manager showed me, only really the cast appreciated it, which was nice, but still.

Oh, and in addition I keep trying to make friends online through various community sites, TvTropes, Reddit, Gaia.
But where-ever I go I almost Always get shit on, or end up as the ""butt monkey"" or get, ""GTFO the internet, faggot"", responses
and sure it's the internet, but I'd hope it's not the same everywhere.

Other than being down about that stuff with my girlfriend, family, college application pressure, lack of people to talk about nerdy things with

I'm really hoping I get come positive reinforcement, or some empathy comments. But that probably won't be the case.

Let's see, other than this, I feel all around skill-less and worthless, as it seems like no matter how much effort I put in, I get less, or very little out of things.

eh8al,depression,justgiraffes,I fucked up...,"This is going to need a bit of backstory. I've stayed on an extra year or university to get a masters, so most of my friends have left. Fresher's week I didn't meet anyone that I really connected with, until near the end where I meet this girl. We started talking but we were both busy with work, so it kind of drops off the radar. Around 4 weeks ago I broke down, somehow convinced myself she wasn't interested in me as a friend and I never really clicked with anyone else here. Term finished this weekend and there was a big party Friday; I end up dancing with her. I needed that badly; I was drowning my sorrows that night and she effectively stopped me.

Up until Saturday the last I heard she had a boyfriend so I didn't try anything. I was content with friendship. It's what need. Found out on Saturday they split up, so I tried dancing with her again that night, see where it went. Anyway, she seemed embarrassed to be with me in front of her friends (I don't know if this is true, but I can't seem to separate reality and my anxiety / paranoia anymore). So I got stupidly drunk; going to the bar every other song didn't help. I don't remember most of the night, but I got stopped by a bouncer from entering the club (He was DEFINITELY in the right, judging by the state of my room after the tantrum I seemed to have just before bed. Like a small child). I may have in the process stopped other people entering, but it's hazy at best. I can't really face anyone anymore and have been drinking since. Worst part is I just need a friend, but I felt like it was a catch 22 - Either I tried dancing with her on Saturday and compromise our friendship, as it always seems to be the case with me, or I don't and I regret not doing so.

ehkhx,depression,bookojob,Depressed BF bringing me down...,"Never even used reddit before being introduced to it by him, actually. However, I now find myself staring at the computer screen for a ridiculous number of hours each day. This is exactly the behavior that he exhibited while in his frequent depressive episodes.

My BF and I have been together for over a year and a half. We are about as committed to each other as two college kids can possibly be. Both of us go to a rather challenging school (fun goes to die there), but he recently had to take a leave of absence due to his depression and its effects on his academics. He left suddenly for Thanksgiving break and did not come back, nor did he inform me.

This is the latest development in the history of depression in our relationship. He was diagnosed shortly after we started dating, and this is probably the worst it's been yet. Because of the coincidence in time, I ended up associating his depression with our relationship. For the better part of a year, I felt solely responsible for the problems I had ""created"". His mother still feels this way about me, and it is difficult to shake the negativity.

BF refuses to see any kind of relationship or personal counselor. I had tried it a bit in the past, but didn't stick with it after departing for summer break. He maintains that he loves me, but often lashes out at the mention of therapy or his disorder, leaving me with no way to help him. Since his sudden departure, I have done little but cry and stare at the internet, and I am getting anxious about finals as I have managed to produce zero motivation to even open a book. With the impending dark and dreary winter, as well as a whole term without being able to see him (I am still very much in love with him and want to help him), I am worried about the deteriorating state of my own mental health.

Not sure if these are the signs of depression developing in me, or perhaps some sort of grieving process over a relationship that didn't get a chance to be happy and healthy.

TL;DR BF has been depressed during most of our relationship, wondering if I too am beginning to develop depression because of prolonged stress.",4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehkhx/depressed_bf_bringing_me_down/,1291714436

I don't have any friends and if I'm not at work, I'm just sitting at home watching cartoons. I probably don't need to describe to you guys what depression is. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half and we have a great relationship. But she doesn't seem as happy as she once was. She gives me reasons like school and family stuff to tell me why, but I can't help feeling I have at least a little bit to do with it. That my being unhappy so much does weigh her down at least a little bit. And I'm terrified of doing that to her. We've talked about it and she says I make her happy but I know that I affect her mood in a negative way more than I'd like.

Any advice someone can give me? To help not do this to her or to at least be able to deal with it better than punishing myself for it? I don't know if this happens in every relationship and I'm just being too hard on myself or if I'm really just not healthy enough to make her happy.

Thanks for any feedback.  ",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehnmv/im_scared_of_pulling_my_girlfriend_down_with_my/,1291731219

***

I’m screwing up my life, doing nothing, just sitting in bed.

This has been my life for the past few weeks. It got gradually worse, all the way up to my current state.

I just don’t even know what to think or what to say.

I just want to punch someone in the face.

Except not really. I don’t actually. But…

I barely have the will to type this.

What the fuck is wrong with me?

How did I manage to fall so far?

FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU

I’m just so…disappointed, ashamed of myself. I feel like I let everyone down, especially myself.

My parents. I let them down.

My grandparents.

My university, which has been so generous with financial aid. Guess they probably regret accepting me now.

I just don’t have the will to do schoolwork anymore. Social interactions pain me. I’m gonna sit alone and be a friendless loser.

How did I fall so far?

I just…don’t get it. Maybe I’m just not good enough. Maybe I just don’t care. I don’t deserve all the advantages I’ve had in this life.

I want to cry, but I can’t bring myself to. Not that I’m trying that hard.

Why should I want to cry? Real men don’t cry over things like this. If they must cry, they do so over something greater, something not under their control.

I’ve done this all to myself.

I feel sickened by myself. I’m not going to kill myself, because that would be far too messy for everyone involved and I’m too much of a pussy.

Also, I guess some inner part of me does have hope.

But I really, really, really need to change the ways I’m doing things.

Why don’t I? Because it’ll take effort. It might hurt. And I’m a huge pussy.

I need to be better than this.",15,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehoo7/reddit_im_a_huge_pussy/,1291734816
ehvef,depression,andtq,Where did you start on the path to treating your depression?,"I hit rock bottom a couple weeks ago and am really interested in pulling myself out of it; I know exactly what needs to be done, but can't seem to make myself do it. I sleep 14- 16 hours a day, have lost 15 lbs, am failing my last semester at school, and am ruining my relationships with people I care about. I'm uninterested in anything -- even my hygiene is slipping, which I never thought would happen. 

I'm taking Prozac, which seems to be working well enough -- but only when I can actually force myself to be awake. I bought a workbook on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but I only got 45 pages into it before I essentially gave up.

I have so much potential. I could take over the world if I wanted to -- and the ideal me would take advantage of every second of the day. But actual-me can't even get out of bed.

I'm a 20 y/o senior in college majoring in bioengineering and currently applying to graduate schools. I've been a pretty good student so far through college, getting a 3.51 gpa. But now, I'm facing a wall in that this first semester of my senior year has been atrociously difficult, where i've seriously overloaded myself. I've already failed one class, luckily i can retake it before i graduate with no real penalty. However, I'm seriously afraid of doing terribly in a fluid mechanics class that is a requirement for my major. If i dont pass/get a high enough grade to count for credit, I have to retake the class, except i'd have to stay for an extra semester. While im sure many people have had this problem in the past, its really bringing me down that its come to this. I'm meeting my professor who claims that ""there's a method to his madness of finals grades"" which makes me feel like i may come out okay in the end, but i really dont know. 

My semesters been killing me as i've rarely seen anyone, save my girlfriend, due to the fact that im either constantly working or studying. I've lost all my friends either due to this time commitment or due to graduation. My best friend went missing in october, I later found out he was hospitalized and is now staying in oregon with family, but I have no idea what actually happened to him as he's been on his family's schedule more than anything else. My grandmother, who played a big role in raising me as a kid passed away last week, and the stress and grief is really bringing me down.

I'm worried about repeating this fluid mechanics class as I feel that any hope for grad school will be thrown out the window once people find out why im sticking around undergrad for another semester. While there are worse things in life, its incredibly depressing that the one thing i've always wanted to do may become impossible for me to do. Not to mention the fact that my parents have no understanding when it comes to these matters. 

I'm going to cut this a bit short as I'm rambling, but I could really use some words of wisdom, pick-me-ups, anything that'll cheer me up as I wait tediously for my thursday meeting with my prof to, essentially, determine my fate. 

tl;dr - May have to stay an extra semester in college to repeat a class, could be a dream killer. was hoping for some kind words more than anything.",6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehvnb/feeling_down_could_use_some_words_of_wisdom/,1291756017

ehyuj,depression,iongantas,My story.,"Hello /r/depression.  I've written here before about a specific incident involving a job ""interview.""  This time I'm just writing more generally.

I have untreated clinical depression.  Some of this is probably genetic, as my mother has major depression and anxiety and was pretty much a non-person for most of my life until maybe five or six years ago.  Due to my life circumstances, I have no recourse for therapy or medication, and I feel pretty iffy about medication anyway, after seeing some of what my mom went through.

Actually, I think I could probably handle my depression on my own if it weren't for my life circumstances, but my depression probably has a large effect on keeping my life circumstances so bad.  Presently I have a crappy part time job at a grocery store with a dick boss.  I have no benefits, and I barely make enough to pay my part for household expenses.  I don't actually make enough to pay for half of our household expenses.

I have a partner who works in the same company, but at a different store.  It doesn't help me to know that he has one year's seniority on me but makes about three dollars more and hour, and is full time, and we both have the same position.

We are totally wrong for each other, but neither of us has any friends nor is able to live independently.  We don't have sex, for the most part, and I can't talk to him about anything at all.  He claims to listen but either has nothing to say about anything I bring up to him (aside from basic logistical concerns) or he responds with something totally off track of what I was trying to tell him.  So basically, I have no one to talk to about anything.

I have a bachelor's degree, a pretty useless one in Philosophy and Psychology, and I have some post-bac experience Art-&gt;Sculpture-&gt;metalwork-&gt;jewelrymaking.  I also did some work in a Master's program for architecture.  I had to drop out because I was unable to finish an important project for studio.  This happened for a number of reasons.  I was getting flak from my fellow students, I was getting flak from people in a social/gaming organization I was in.  My partner at the time (different one) was also getting flak from them, he had Asperger's and I was getting the short end from him as well.  And then I discovered WoW and was drowned in it for the week(spring break mind you) that I was supposed to be working on the project.  I also received no useful advice from the teacher of the studio on how the project should be done, and the project really was just unworkable at the scale they were asking.  I also didn't have adequate resources and was in a number of other binds due to situational factors that just made it basically impossible.

So I dropped out, and then a couple years later found out that they had ""adjusted"" my expenses so that I owed the school money on an already paid-for semester.  And I only found this out from getting calls from collection agencies.  So now I have no way of ever going back to school.  But that was later.

At the time I dropped out, I was pretty much devastated.  I've recovered very slightly since then, as I have since concocted new goals, but they seem very helpless, hopeless and undoable.

The partner at the time basically became very unsatisfied with me, and I wasn't able to find a job or anything, so he hooked us up with my current partner, and we were briefly a triad before he cheated on us and moved out, which was almost two years ago.

My vague goals now are to get into programming and ideally game programming, though this seems more futile the more I look into it.  I am also generally unable to focus and have a bunch of projects that I bounce between.  And due to my work schedule and low pay, I never have any energy, and I can't eat or exercise properly.

I have $70k+ in student loans that I can defer, but probably never pay off.  I have another smaller loan that can't be deferred, eats up my extra money when I have it, and isn't going away with any particular speed.

My family is of no help.  If I could just get a vaguely satisfying job that wasn't populated by morons and paid me enough to pay off my smaller loan and pay my own costs, I could probably get somewhere and cope with my depression.",6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehyuj/my_story/,1291767427
ehzwp,depression,StoneSpace,I'm sorry.,"I am a PhD student in a foreign country. They give me money, go figure, and I'm pretty comfortable. But I don't feel like I'm up to the task. I feel like I'll never get to know what I need to know to deserve to be able to do whatever I want and not be an actually productive member of society.

But then there are days when I realize all these theories are bullshit, mental masturbation that won't bring any good and won't really eventually help anyone, and I feel like I'm floating in a murky academic pond and just want to get out of here, to a better university, where my talents will finally be able to come out unaltered, with inspiration and passion, in a topic I know and feel is for the good of humanity.

But then I know this is just escapism, and I just can't quit another fucking PhD, no one will trust me again. That I am not in such a bad position and I'm just making myself feel bad, probably as an excuse to do nothing and coast on governmental goodwill as I've always done. I'm so fucking sorry. Fuck.

And you, girl. Don't know what I feel for you. Comes in waves. Don't know what you feel either. We're not together, officially, despite the two or three nights a week we spend in each other's beds, each other's arms. You say you'd feel guilty to see other people, so that we maybe should see each other less, so that we (read: I) would not be so hurt. But when I come over to your place and you wrap yourself around me at night I know that the feeling is right, even though they haven't blossomed fully.

I keep being nice to you, and am disappointed whenever you go out and I am not invited, when you see your cute coworker you told me about. I try to repress that disappointment, as I know you can do what you want, and I see other people anyway, obviously, so I should stop being such a whiny bitch. But repressing these feelings brings out this passive-aggressiveness which I absolutely despise in myself, and in the end I'm just manipulating you to feel sorry for not spending time with me. I know you'd rather be with someone more handsome, or talented, or whatever, at the very least who doesn't feel so fucking sorry for themselves for every insignificant fuckup. And anyway, I fucked it up by rejecting your (and my) initial feelings out of fear of I don't even fucking know what. I'm sorry. I care so much for you, but maybe I just want the self-reassurance that someone somewhere can care for me, and as such that my caring for you is just a manipulative egocentric trick that has everything to do with myself and nothing to do with you as a person, except that you are someone I feel could give me this affection and attention that I crave and become so horribly addicted to. I'm sorry.

And I am terribly afraid that rejecting these feelings of guilt, anguish, jealousy, will end up killing any feelings I have for you, and I will end up alone, again. And I'm afraid. I don't want to be alone.

Anything I ever do can be cast in egotistical terms, so I will never be able to know my true motivation. Isn't that fucking terrifying?",7,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehzwp/im_sorry/,1291771406
ei2qz,depression,mschoe,"My story in 1,930 words.","So, I'm a 16 year old, with some problems, but not some sob story. In a way you can kinda say I live the same life as anyone else. I don't know, I've always kinda been odd I guess. In elementary school, I was called a goth by this kid who no one understood, in grade 6. He never called me a goth in a bad term, just more of a statement. I remember two girls wanted to be his best friend, and he'd do whatever he could to ignore them. I didn't really care or notice him much. But everytime I was walking home and he saw me, he'd either wait or run up to keep walking with me. He left the year he came, and that same year, I lost my best friend to a new girl. In grade 7 I started becoming, more emotional I guess. I just cried practically every day. I don't know why. But there was always a reason, be it something that happened at school, or when my parents yelled at me. Near the end of the year my class went to a university for a few days. I really liked this one boy, let's call him Jason. Jason was best friends with another guy in my class who I just couldn't stand because of how rude he is. On the last day, we were going to go on a boat for a dance type thing. We all got ready, and then some of us girls found out that Jason's best friend, bet Jason and another guy money to dance with one girl and myself. The girl really liked the one boy, and I really liked Jason. But because that other boy bet them $10 each to fucking dance with us? And I know, a dance. Who cares. But when you were in a class of 20, who all practically grew up together. It was a big deal. Me and this girl got so upset. My teacher came over to me and kept saying, it will be alright, karma is a bitch, and it will come. It made me feel better, but every time I looked at Jason on the boat I kept crying. I had to sit on the top deck while everyone was downstairs inside because I couldn't stop crying. Sadly, I suck at staying mad at people, so I ended up forgiving Jason a few weeks later.
	By the time I was in grade 8, I was still emotional, crying a lot. There was a group of about 5 people who loved to pick on me, my ex-best friend, her new best friend, that boy who bet Jason, and two other boys. One day during science they actually started throwing stuff into my hair. I started bawling, and I had to run out of the room.
	Once ninth grade came, I already cut ties with practically every person from my old school except for about 4 or 5 people. I found new friends, got more confidence and I wasn't as emotional. By the end of the first semester I met a boy named Keith. Keith was one of those people who just always made me smile. He disappeared for a bit after a month of talking to him. I checked his facebook, and he claimed he was attempting suicide. He drank some sort of chemicals and ended up in the hospital. I was so worried, because a few days before it all happened he got his phone taken away. He texted me a week later saying, Sorry. Some stuff was going on. Are you okay? I was so worried, and he never really told me what happened, just that he was really sorry and he had some family issues. It pretty much went back to normal after a few weeks. Back then he used text me saying how much he liked me, or how much he wished we hung out more. So many times I'd wake up with my cell phone sitting on my pillow beside me with 5 unread texts, all from him saying goodnight because he knew I fell asleep. He used to always walk me home, and he was always too shy to ask me out in person. For some reason though, I always said no after the first time I said yes. Because he got his friend to ask me out for him, his friend got him confused after I said yes, so we never did. One day he was at camp with his family, and I was at my grandparents, he texted me saying how much he misses everyone, especially me. His younger brother even took his phone when he fell asleep to tell me how much he liked me. He meant so much to me. One day he admitted he cut. I was so upset and distraught. He even showed me them after I kept asking. But once he showed me, I couldn't look at him, I thought, ""How could someone do something so terrible to them self?""
	By the end of July I was going to Germany for a few weeks, I told him as a joke I was moving, but he believed me, for some reason I went moody and as a cruel joke kept it going, he was crying. I felt terrible afterwards. But I don't remember apologizing. When I left, we still talked on msn, and he would stay up until 3am just to talk to me because of the time difference. Though a week or so before I came home, we had a huge fight. It was 8 am for me, 2 am for him. He stayed up until 2 am, to message me, saying how much of a clingy bitch I was.
	He went away for a camp the week I came back, I was so glad because we still weren't talking. I knew the date he came back, so I was calm. Three days before I thought he was coming back, he called me. I guess I sounded harsh, our phone call was a total of 30 seconds. I started crying so much once he hung up.
	By October, Keith and I completely stopped talking. It was completely my fault though, but I wouldn't accept it. And convinced so many others it was his fault. He transferred to a different school that year, and found a girlfriend. I met a guy online named Luke though, I didn't mind as much. Luke was so nice and funny, he lived in a different province but would always text and call me. I always believed every word he said. But sadly he was suicidal. And would always bring it up, it was heart wrenching.
	One day I went on a school trip with two people, one friend and one boy from my elementary school. The boy brought up our elementary days. And I told him I hated them, he told me, my whole class thought I cut in grade 8 because I was always upset. I lied and told them I do cut and started in grade 9. I automatically questioned myself why I would say that. I guess it was Keith, or maybe my friends from elementary who cut to be a 'rebel'. I didn't cut, I didn't for a while. Well, until January. I don't remember if it was a fight between my family and I, or Luke. I felt the blade, and I winced. I didn't do it again for a while. I started again, I don't remember why, but I ended up telling one of my friends at the time, David. He made me promise him I wouldn't do it again. I didn't. I lasted 4 months, until he broke his pinky promise. So I broke mine. I only cut once or twice a month. I didn't really think much of it. By grade 10 though, I got in more fights with my parents, my mom and I fought over everything. My dad always agreed with my mom, and my brother just wished I was dead. I started feeling more alone no matter how many people surrounded me.
	I started writing poems, mostly about depression, or whoever upset me that week. I stopped suddenly once school ended. By June, Luke and I always fought, and I would go weeks ignoring him. Eventually I felt so bad, I started talking again, but saying it would never be the same. I never really truly believed who he said he was. I believed his age by his voice though. By August he spilled to me. He wasn't Luke Valentine, a 17year old. He was Jeremiah Smith, a 16 year old. I couldn't decide how to feel, that he cares enough to tell me who he is. Or to be raging at the fact I fell for someone who he made up. I chose the second one, and went off at him. By this point, I have started cutting so much more. I just felt numb for a long time.
	I once wrote a post about who I was on Tumblr. My friend saw it, and started crying. She took me to guidance at my school the next day. She made me tell guidance that I cut.
	I lied. I convinced them I stopped in May. That's when I started cutting more. That's when the guidance counsellor told me, I'd have to call my parents and tell them. My friend was beside me, crying more than I was. When the counsellor was on the phone, I blurted out to tell my dad I wasn't suicidal, because he thought I was before.
	I have seen my mother cry multiple times. I have never seen her cry so much in my lifetime. My dad went away to Paris that week. It was just me, my mother and brother. 
	Ever since then, I have been cutting so much more, just to feel something. I know some people who squirm when I told them I cut. So I keep telling them, because I know they don't care that I do. I feel like I can't tell people who care because it makes me feel so much worse. They care about me, and I don't. I'm more of a bitch now, I've lost over 30 friends this year alone. I always feel alone, no matter who I'm with, or how many friends I have. I could be with 5 closest friends, and still feel alone. I'm always depressed, and I can never seem to see anything in a positive light. I have the words fuck up carved into my leg and the word fat on my stomach. I have cuts running on every piece of skin I can cover.
	At a hallowe'en party, I got really drunk, I told those I didn't want to know that I cut. I told everyone I was sorry, but I just wanted to forget. Obviously, a drunken mind speaks a sober heart. I told one of my friends one of the main reasons I cut. Because I hate how I look, because I find myself disgusting and fat. She told me I wasn't either. I laughed in her face. Now, I avoid my friends more and more. Maybe I just don't deserve them.
	Because I feel like I'll never believe people when they say I look nice, or I have a nice personality. I'm just always tired now. Maybe one day I won't have to force a smile to seem like I'm alright. I feel like I'm tearing apart.

ei98b,depression,running_on_empty,Back to 'normal',"Normal for me is depression. I don't remember the last time I wasn't truly depressed (not including my brief reprieve recently). Must have been when I was a kid and didn't know any better.

I've posted here before. More than once. I've posted in the AMA's about how I was going to go across the US to meet the girl I'd been talking to for over two years. No one directly asked me but it didn't work out. While on the ride back home she told me she didn't want to be in any relationship at the moment. Later she asked if we could still be best friends. I thought I could deal with the whole situation at the time but the reality is coming back slowly. No love lasts forever, and I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life.

I'd never thought about suicide before I met her. I also never drank. Not that I drink a lot. But one night I just got pushed over the edge and got myself drunk. And now I think about suicide a lot. Not that I'd do it.... For some reason I have some kind of mental block against it. I'd never do it. And that's another depressing point- there's no way out for me. I can't kill myself, I don't have enough money for food, let alone alcohol or drugs. I have no friends. I have no time to do anything but work. I'm stuck in this existence.

No, I know what reddepression will say, and I don't want to talk to anyone. My parents and I are as distant emotionally as strangers, and I never want to open up to them about any of this. There's no one else to talk to. I desire to talk to therapists even less than my parents, and I couldn't afford them anyway.

Sometimes I feel I see a light, a little bit of happiness here or there. It's maddening because I don't have the means to reach it. Happiness might be completing a new website, but I never reach it because I don't have the attention span or work ethic to finish. I don't have the creativity and my intelligence is waning. I realize all this and the light goes away and life sucks again.

I don't know.... Depression is normal for me. It used to be comforting because it was the thing I remembered. But my trip showed me how to be happy for a few days. I guess I never really knew what I was missing and I was okay with it. Now I know. I did things on that trip that I want to do again but know I never will. I know what I'm missing now and that just makes my life worse.

TL;DR - I lead a worthless, depressed life, understanding the happiness I miss out on. The love of my life doesn't want a relationship with me, but wants to be friends. I have no way out.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ei98b/back_to_normal/,1291812730

eif9j,depression,datingdepressive,"How to proceed with GF of ~8 mo who doesn't like herself, has social anxiety, and seems mildly depressed.","Thanks in advance for anyone willing to read this. There's a **tl;dr** below.

I've posted to r/relationship_advice several times within the past two months under different accounts. Glad I found this subreddit because it might give me better insight into my girlfriend.

You see, I've been with her for about 8 months and things were actually pretty good at the beginning (but that's usually the case). I noticed early in that she wasn't too keen on doing too many social things. I learned later that she is medicated for social anxiety (klonopin). She also has very low energy and thinks she might have ""mild"" depression, but seems afraid to admit it right out. She has also mentioned several times that she has low self-esteem, actually saying she doesn't like herself. 

I have to admit, dating her has been more of a challenge as compared to any other girl I've dated. ""Challenging"" not in the sense that she demands much of me, but challenging in the way that I feel like I am keeping us afloat. I sometimes even feel like she withdraws and I can't help but think she's pushing me away. So I don't know if how she's been should be construed as signals that she wants me to fuck off or if I'm being naïve by assuming she still actually likes me, and that the way she's been has more to do with what she's going through; and not me.

My main concern is that I want her to know I care about her without scaring her off and feeling that she has to feel pressured to ""perform."" Right now (in the short term) it isn't such a big deal she doesn't like to go and do the things that I like to do even if I wish she could be with me at times when friends have their girlfriends around. We even once almost broke-up because she kept insisting I wasn't happy and felt like she was trying to ""let me off the hook."" The thing is, it may be too early for me to know whether or not I love her, but I really do care about her as a person. She's pretty emotionally closed-off and I'm closer to being an open book. I've actually had to make a conscious effort to step on the figurative brakes so as to not overwhelm her. 

I guess I really don't know how to approach this relationship. I sometimes chalk up her lack of motivation for lack of interest, but even if that was the case, I wouldn't know whether it's more a symptom of her depression/anxiety or if she's truly disinterested. When we're together, it sometimes feels like she wants me there (as affectionate as she can relatively be) then other times it's like she's aware of how she's coming off (and has even mentioned it) and seems to close herself off. 

Social anxiety coupled with mild depression and low self-esteem is nothing I've dealt with in a partner before. How can I show her that I care without overwhelming her? I don't want to feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her for the fear of doing something ""wrong."" In regards to her low self-esteem, would anything I say or do to counter those feelings be counter-productive or ineffective? I definitely don't want to be the cheery, annoying person who constantly tells her she's ""worth something"" and ""wonderful"", etc. However, I feel like I *show* her she matters to me, so should that be enough? 

Also, I can't discern whether the way she acts is a reflection of her attitude towards me or if it's mainly because of the third-party causes I've mentioned. I have zero experience with dating someone like this. I look back at the first several months of our dating and she tried a bit harder but that may have been because of the honeymoon phase. However, she's always had an aversion toward really going out and doing anything, especially around a big group and late at night. (She has extremely low energy.) So most of the time we have together has been one-on-one, not doing anything short of watching tv, or playing board games, etc. Only a handful of times in the 8 months we've been together have we done anything with a group of other people. This isn't a complaint, but just giving you some perspective.

I sometimes feel like I should just give her complete space and wait until she comes to me, but I've tried that; and I felt like she construed that as I was growing bored of her, confirming what *she* thought *I* thought about her (saying things like ""you think I'm a bad gf, right? You're not happy."") But I wonder if she was just projecting and perhaps she isn't happy because of me. I really don't know. I'm at a loss. I really care about her but I don't know how to approach this. We almost broke up once around the time I backed off a bit but we instead decided to keep things going at a casual pace, etc and she was open to that, especially when I mentioned that there'd be no pressure for her to ""perform""; just to be herself. She liked the idea. She was very affectionate that night, but I also hadn't seen her in a month. Because of that alone (how affectionate she was), I like to think I'm not fooling myself and that she really does like me, even if it's not to the extent (and consistentcy) that I wish she could show it.

I'm trying to stick it out with her as long as I can because I do care about her, but this is proving to be difficult since my face-to-face and communication/emotional needs are higher than hers, but right now, I'm just glad she's still with me. But I'm not sure how to progress with her if I want to keep this thing afloat. Maybe I can be offered some insights or pointed to resources, old-posts, or any advice you can give me. I know each case is unique but I'll take anything that might help me get an understanding of how she may be seeing the world, and how I can find that equilibrium between being supportive without overwhelming her. Thank you, Reddit.
*I'm in the midst of studying for finals right now so my responses may be intermittent.* Thanks again. 

**tl;dr** I've been with my girlfriend for ~8 months. I've come to realize she suffers from social anxiety (medicated with klonopin), says she doesn't like herself (low self esteem) and seems to exhibit symptoms of depression. I want to be a good boyfriend to her/supportive without saying/doing things that are counter-productive or overwhelming her with anything, but I also want to ensure she doesn't think I'm giving up either. At times it felt like she would push me away and didn't know if this was actually because of me or things she's struggling with. I want her to feel supported but I realize I have needs to. I will try to stick this out as long as I can, but I just need advice on how to proceed with her considering the circumstances. I have zero experience in this type of relationship in any capacity.

eii71,depression,endlessfloptimism,feeling very sad and helpless.,"Over the last few months I have started to feel worse and worse. I figured it was stress from work, but I'd always handled stress okay and I was not handling this so well. I've been increasingly fatigued and irritable. Constant headaches.

This is exacerbated by the fact that fewer and fewer of my friends, both high school and college friends, seem inclined to talk to me or include me in activities. They are almost all engaged or married, so maybe it's that they can't relate to me anymore. the college friends (graduated in 07) all live fairly far away and typically the only time I see them is when I drive up to them. The day before thanksgiving, though, they made plans to hang out 15 minutes from my house and didn't invite me until 3 hours before. I felt like a total afterthought.

I'm kind of seeing someone, but he lives an hour away and I don't get the impression that he cares very much. He flakes on me a lot and hardly ever has a kind word for me. When I'm in a romantic relationship, I frequently go out of my way to do nice things and be considerate of the other person. I'm up front with my feelings and make my expectations clear (of which there are few). I listen and will do anything to help if they need it. I keep thinking I should just get over it because not everyone is going to do things how I do.

I used to exercise almost every day, taking classes at the gym or jogging or yoga. Now the thought of exercising makes me exhausted. A woman humiliated me in front of a full spin class by loudly demanding I get off of her bike 10 minutes into the class. I was so embarrassed I haven't been able to go back. Yoga is so crowded lately it stresses me out to be in there. And jogging may be out because I have knee and ankle troubles. I can tell I have gained a couple pounds from not being as active which makes me feel so ashamed of my laziness.

Yesterday my dr told me she thinks I'm depressed and prescribed an antidepressant. It's good to have an explanation I suppose but at the same time I wonder if she's wrong and I'm just a whiny idiot.

I'm so sorry, I don't even know why I'm posting this. None of these seem like real problems. I know there are people going through much worse. I guess I was hoping to get some outside perspectives because I feel like I'm going crazy inside my own head. I don't want to burden people so I keep a lot to myself. There has to be something I can do that makes it easier to get up in the morning or that makes me not be on the verge of tears all the time.",7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eii71/feeling_very_sad_and_helpless/,1291841751
eijnp,depression,therealforeveralone,"I am the real ""forever alone,"" and I wonder how much longer I can go on...","(TL;DR at bottom)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*snip* edited intro.....I wasn't trying to be attention grabbing or funny about the ""real forever alone"" thing. I really do feel like that meme totally fits me. (though, strangely, I find the comics humorous, instead of offensive or depressing).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short version:

I've been alone pretty much all my life. I do have one friend who is close. But he's more like a brother than anything. I've lived alone for three years, and have had trouble coping. Periods of self-punishment, and self deprivation. I've sought conseling in the past, which hasn't been the best experience. Kind of luke warm advice and at a premium price thanks to my insurance charging me 6 times what they said they would. I'm desperately alone. And I'm really encroaching on my limits to cope with it. In fact, I've been balancing pretty close to this threshold for about a year now. I am wearing thin. I know I need to talk to a professional to get help with my depression &amp; mild anxiety, as it has gotten to the point that I am mostly listless. I don't get my work done on time. I barely get out of bed on the weekends. I really have no interest in doing anything....

Full version : Meh. didn't post. It's over 10,000 chars and I don't care to edit it. And you probably don't care to read it. So, it works both ways.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- tl;dr

So really, after all this dumping of thought (well, it would have been alot. But, oh well) the only thing I really have to ask you guys is...

1) Is there a substantial difference between a psychotherapist and a counseling service? (I assume there is, but my counselors in the past were never willing to advise me on that)

2) Is there a way to know for sure my insurance company will cover me to see someone and not wind up sticking me with a huge bill later?

3) If the answer to 2 is 'no', then are there any real psychotherapists that work on a sliding scale like these bullshit counseling services?

eim4k,depression,jasirla,Don't know what to think or feel any more. Would very much appreciate some opinions.,"I'm a university student living in a foreign country for 1 year, doing my courses' third year which is work placement.
When I moved here this was an amazing experience. Moving from a modest city to London, where I am now was amazing; a dream come true. I moved in with 5 co-workers; all in the same situation as me, in University, third year, living away from home (but in their case, not a foreign country). Usually people spend some time being acquaintances with each other before they move into being true friends, then good friends. That period has come and gone and I am realising that I do not relate to them. I am different, I do not fit in here at all. I feel socially awkward with them all the time and each day that passes they resent me more for me not fitting in with them.
My girlfriend is in another country doing a similar (albeit academic rather than work) year abroad. She has great friends who care for her and whom she feels connected to. I could not be further from this. It is at a point now where I feel afraid and anxious when 5pm approaches, because I know I'll have to go home and be around them. When I argue something they all gang up on me and make me feel very unwelcome in the house. I cannot make friends here as nobody can relate to me at all.
I feel completely alone every day. This was bearable a month or two ago but not now. It's making me feel so bad that I can hardly find the energy to do anything but go to work, go home, sit in my room and go to sleep. I feel like crying all the time. To make things worse, every time I speak to my GF I bring her down with me, so I'm worried about making it hard on her too, which she's conveyed to me. She tells me she's there for me but at this stage I can see she's just saying it habitually. Every time I talk to her she tells me about her day with her friends doing X, Y and Z which all sounds like fun, immediately making me sad for not having what she has. It only takes a few words like these to completely destroy any minuscule piece of confidence I manage to build during the day, and remember just how lonely I am.
I can't remember what it feels like to be happy. I can't remember what it feels like not to be lonely, or anxious, or introverted. I've never been like this in my entire life. I'm not sure what to think any more, or how to feel.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eim4k/dont_know_what_to_think_or_feel_any_more_would/,1291854564

I have started exercising, taking my vitamins and trying to eat better, it has only been about two weeks but I don't feel any better. Actually I feel worse.  

Most days at work I am fighting back the tears feeling lost and overwhelmed.  There is no one to delegate work to and it would be unbearable to go to my boss and say I can't handle my job. I really can't lose my job.   I keep applying for work both in and out of my company but no interest so far.  I feel helpless to change my situation.  Can't afford school right now either.

I am on Wellbutrin and usually it's fine.  Last time this happened my Doctor added Effexor but getting off the Effexor last time was absolute hell.  My Dr slowly tapered me off but seriously it gave me a whole new level of compassion for the withdrawal drug addicts go through.

I feel stuck at the bottom of a dark hole with no way out.  I am not suicidal but just in deep deep dark dark despair.  I am open to any ideas to get through this because honestly I don't know what to do.  I have no one to talk to. I feel so alone.

I am also terrified of his ""poison pill"" file and whatever it may contain. I don;t like the hacking attacks or the government's response to the situation in general. I try to avoid the news, but I know enough about what's going on to fear the worst, if I haven't checked in a while. I also won't do illegal drugs, so that's out. I have to wonder if this has to do with a change in medicine. I'm not sure if that happened or not, but my pills (effexor) did take a different shape. I have had many different sizes and colors of Effexor in the past, so I didn't think too much about it. This could also be anxiety about my own future manifesting itself as anxiety about the world.

ej2qb,depression,Worthless_Useless,Seroquel XR experiences?,"Due to a combination of insomnia and growing depression/anxiety, my psychiatrist put me on 50mg of Seroquel XR.  I have taken it each of the last two nights around 9:00 (roughly 2-3 hours before I go to bed).  I am taking it so early in the evening by my psychiatrist's advice in order for the sedation to be worn off by the time I get up in the morning.  However, yesterday, I had a somewhat drugged feeling that lasted until around 4 or 5 pm.  Today, I have the same drugged feeling.  The drugged feeling is such that it's not particularly debilitating, but I am a little lightheaded, and I feel like my response time is delayed such that I don't feel particularly safe driving.

ej81v,depression,onlyoncethistime,A thanks to the community,"For the first time in my life I have talked to a doctor about my anxiety and depression issues. I'm usually pretty happy, but about every 3 months for the last couple years I've had extreme anxiety attacks and major feelings of depression. It would feel like a thousand thoughts were running through my head at the same time, and I just didn't know what to do, which would lead me to being apathetic about what happens, which lead to panic when I realised what I had done, and so on.

By suggestion of this community, I finally contacted my college and made an appointment with a doctor through them. Unfortunately that appointment was changed to a date I was going to be out of state (holidays), but I kept calling other places until I made a new one at a different office. On the way there, pretty comically, I got lost on Seattle's public transit system, and managed to figure this out with only 30 minutes left until my appointment. Instead of shutting down and giving up, like I used to, I called a cab and had them drive me. *Then* I ended up leaving my phone in the cab and had to sprint after it for 3 blocks. I was a few minutes late, but I made it.

I saw a doctor that night, he seemed very understanding. I was prescribed Citalopram and, though it's only been a week, I do feel a difference. Much more balanced. It may just be a placebo effect, but I'm real proud I've done *something*. I have now also talked with my family about what I was going through, and for the first time in a long time I feel... okay with the future.

I always used to feel I should be strong enough, of my own volition, to get through the way I felt. I've come to realise that sometimes you need some help if you want to learn to walk properly again.

ej98o,depression,st0machAche,advice: i have diagnosed problems but i refuse to go back to medication. anyone else been here? advice?,"its taken weeks of failed attempts for me to finally post this:

i was diagnosed with depression (dysthymia) and OCD about ten years ago. i went to multiple therapists and went through different medication, ups and down with my insurance company, and generally dealing with therapy. when i say dealing with therapy, i mean past the initial breakthrough of confirming and making me realize i had these mental issues, therapy just turned into me paying money to complain to someone for an hour about the bullshit in my life. never felt like any real progress past having an ear to complain too.

here's my main issue: medication. 

pros: there were the obvious benefits of feeling somewhat better moodwise. plus any sex drive issues were completely erased by the side effects making me able to ""take care of business"" way longer than most girls would ever want or need me to (this was a definite pro for the medication compared to how things were before without it).

cons: dear lord, the whole time i was on medication i felt like a zombie. the one constant in my life is the ability to joke around about anything and make stupid comments about anything in front of me. medication blocked all of that out and left a blank cloud filling my head with nothing. many times i felt myself thinking about how odd it was that i could not think of even one thing to say, where previously it always came naturally to me. another problem was that i am a creative person. one of the only things that gets me through life is making music. medicine blocked that out as well and left me completely blank alot of times when trying to be creative.

i would normally at this point just think ""let me give it another try and see if i notice any side effects again."" the problem is there were many side effects that happened while on medication that i could not notice at the time, but looking back now its clear as hell to me now. multiple times i remember myself breaking down and crying at random times (once at work, another time in front of friends...). that shit would never normally happen. i also remember many (out of character) dick headish things that i said to people that i can't imagine saying now. but remembering back then, i said all those things without thinking any of it was wrong or harmful. and i was wrong. it was stupid things to say that i would never normally say. very out of character for me. it was almost like a barrier of internal bullshit that i normally have up was removed and i was saying stuff to people that should not have been said.

so now, the point of this post is to ask if anyone else here has been where i am. my issues still exist and dictate where i am in life right now (stuck in a rut with no progress in sight). my depression and ocd definitely contribute to my antisocial behaviors of feeling shame and guilt, while also causing me to pass up every great lifechanging opportunity presented to me for fear of obvious definite failure. i have been stuck in the same spot in life for a long time and i see no way out.

i find it hard for me to imagine making any progress the way things are now, but at the same time i cant imagine going back to medication with all the issues i've had with it. 

i feel like i am wasting everyday of my life stuck like this and don't know what to do.

any advice?

ejigs,depression,[deleted],Why does sadness feel so good?,"It's like some kind of cathartic release sometimes, sitting here weeping. There's beauty in it, almost like a negative euphoria; it feels just as true and right as happiness. But when you're happy, you look back on the sad times as 'pathetic'; forgetting they're just as real, just as poignant. I almost crave the feeling of sadness as a release; it really is quite curious, for a 19-year old.

It's occurred to me that I like being happy but hate the chase, the obsession for happiness. I hate the desires, the needs, the desires, the whole lot. It creates fake friendships, the false idea that you are getting somewhere in life, that you as an individual are important or significant in any way, the goal orientation, the ridiculous idea of 'success', whatever the hell that even means. But most of all I hate the taboo. The likes of 'don't worry, be happy'. Happiness has replaced any religious God as our master and we are slaves to it.

What we want, really, is satisfaction. To kick back and say 'that was okay after all'; the good times and the bad are both included in that. And to feel that way, I need to throw any notions of happiness out of the window, to just accept my feelings as what they are as all necessary parts to a whole. And sure, if I'm sad all my life, I'm performing a duty which is necessary for someone else to be 'happy'. They can look over at me, see my sadness, and think 'boy, I'm glad I'm not him!' (of course, it'd be far more respectful for that person to say 'I have utmost respect for your sadness, for you allow me to feel happiness') - Indeed, their happiness *depends* on me being sad, and my sadness requires me to look at other 'happy' people and say 'wow, those lot are having a good time, why aren't I?'

And so I no longer see depression as a negative thing but rather a way of life which comes and goes. I relish in it. It's the depression that 'too, will pass'.",11,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejigs/why_does_sadness_feel_so_good/,1291985349

ejive,depression,thetimbot,"Last night I was finally able to be honest with myself and my girlfriend, I've never been so scared for the future.","Hey everyone,

This is my first time being on this side of a post in this forum. I don't know if this the right place since I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm depressed but I trust the community here.

In highschool I didn't think I was smart enough to go to med school so I took college prep courses and did a diploma in biotechnology instead. After finishing college second in my class I was accepted to University and told everyone maybe I could handle med school after all. Instead of going, I accepted a job as a biotech sales rep and moved to Toronto with my then girlfriend. 

After four months things fell apart, I realized I didn't want to spend my life with her and that my job made me miserable. My solution was to run away to university and take another shot at med school. Part way through I realized I had made it impossible to be considered for acceptance since the med school here requires two consecutive years with 5 courses a semester. Because of my transfer credits from college and the way pre-reqs worked out the most courses Ive had at one time is 4.

I convinced myself that nurse practitioner was a better fit for me, using the standard stereotypes (nursing is about the whole person, doctors are robots, etc...). I've been accepted to a nursing program and I know that one day I will get into an NP program and practice in a specialty that grants autonamy nearly equal to that of a physician.

Last night my girlfriend and I were having a talk and I just blurted it out. Ill never be satisfied as an NP not because of hierarchy, prestige, or money, but because Ill always wish I had the in depth knowledge of the fundamentals that only physicians are trained to have. 

For a moment it was relaxing to have finally stopped lying to myself. I know that I am good enough at school to get into a med school and compassionate enough to be the kind of doctor I would want to be. That feeling of relief has been replaced with doubt and fear since. What if I take the two year to get myself eligible and don't get in anywhere? what if I don't get in until I'm in my 30s (25 now)? What if I can only succeed by being so devoted that I neglect my girlfriend and she leaves me? 

I'm scared now because I know that lying to myself won't be therapeutic anymore. So what should I do?

Please forgive spelling miscues... this was from my phone.

I'm not sure if this is depression or what but I couldn't think of a better place to submit this to.

I am at college (CS) right now but I don't see the point of it. I don't think I've learned any new, valuable stuff, and it makes me hate to do things on my own like I did in highschool, so it actually made stuff worse. Pretty much the only reason I got here is that I didn't want to go to a job and it would be hard to get one without degree anyway.

On weekends I just keep wasting time on reddit and similar sites, staying up late and then sleeping till noon. Getting out of the bed is the worst part of the day.

I go to gym, that is pretty much the only thing I like doing now, and I always look forward to it.

Right now I'm putting off some projects, just because I don't have any motivation to do them. I might get kicked out. This scares me. I do not care about getting kicked out itself. But this would mean I would disappoint family and friends. I wouldn't see my friends very often, if they even wanted to keep being friends. I have really no idea what they would think of me. It would mean I've wasted a lot of my parents money on this. It would mean I would have to get a job. I'm not prepared for this kind of responsibility (or any other, for that matter...).

I'm happy when I'm distracted from this. Watching movies, being with family or friends. But I'm worried everything is going downhill. I find myself thinking about stuff like this more and more every day. It takes me ages to get asleep because I can't get this out of my head.

The only motivation for me is to stay in school, keep going like this. Every day the same as the last one. No goal, no purpose. No fun. Only brief moments of happiness in between. And negative motivation isn't really working for me.

Take the medication for the rest of my life, this medication is so strong, I am sometimes unable to string the most simple sentence together &amp; I am sometimes unable to walk. I cannot go on like this for the rest of my life. Even a week of this is enough to leave anyone insane. 

I'm on the verge of just leaving my home and just going somewhere (I don't know how to explain it). I really am at my wits end, plus the stress of not being able to work and seeing my girlfriend come home every night tired  makes me feel worthless. 

It's just hard as anything trying to cope with this pain, as it isn't that common, something like 0.25% of the UK population have it I was told. Even my GP suggested like 10 different things before I ended up going to hospital one night in agony. I've joined a TN forum, but it's rather depressing lol everyone posts success stories and how they cope... I can't. :(",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejtkj/really_down_ready_to_take_my_final_bow/,1292024465
ejtxm,depression,[deleted],In a situation where I am very stuck and hate it.,"Hey guys, 

This is my first introspective post I've ever made on a public forum, so I apologize in advance if it ends up being ranty, random, nonsensical or simply indiscernible. 

I'm a fairly content fellow. When I'm out and about, I'm all smiles. When I'm with friends, I'm always laughing and always telling jokes. When I'm at home, I hide away in my room, think dark thoughts and simply want to get out. As an aside, I'd like to say that ""get out"" does *not* imply suicide - I have had friends commit suicide and, truly, I don't want to do that to those around me... It's selfish and causes so much pain.

I suppose I'll get into some backstory as to why I'm feeling stuck (in my current situation).

It all started about 2.5 years ago. I was in a relationship with this girl, and had been for almost 3 years. We were a healthy couple despite me going to school in a different city. I was finally home for that summer and got to spend more time with her. That's when I found out she cheated on me. The tl;dr of that story is: She cheated on me with the Australian man who took advantage of her when she was 13 years old. 

That crushed me. I had nothing but trust and faith in that relationship, and that simple action brought it all crashing down. I had always felt slightly depressed before that, but the relationship coupled with school helped in keeping me focused. I spiralled downwards. I got aggressive (I am *not* an aggressive person) if/when we talked (after we had broken up, of course), I spent days alone in my room, I didn't want to talk to anyone, didn't want to see anyone... It was horrible. There is a ton more to that story, but I'll leave it there.

While all this was happening, one of my best friends pulled me through. She would listen, she would help and would be there (after I came out of my shell). We've now been dating for about 1.5 years. 

I graduated from my school program this past winter (Music diploma) and am currently back home and working. I'm working in order to be able to afford going to Berklee College of Music in Boston without having to take out any student loans. I have a good job with the city. It is high pay but difficult work. Overall, I don't hate my job but it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life.

The problem is being back home. Since my ex and I broke up, and since I had been away for another year for school, everything back here changed in regards to my friends. A lot of them have claimed they 'hate' me (my ex is a compulsive liar, so I can only assume she lied to all of them [they were all mutual friends] and put me in the wrong) and the rest simply don't want to spend time with me. I try opening up to them, asking them if they want to do a quick lunch or something - always 'no.' 

At this point in time, the last time I've spent time with friends was late July. 

I am currently living at home with my parents in order to save more money for school, but the situation here has gotten worse too. It seems that since I moved away, my parents started hating each other. They sleep in different rooms, never spend more than 2 minutes in the same room together, neglect housework (I do a lot of it now), are passive-aggressive or are simply aggressive. I really wish they'd just get a divorce, frankly. It's extremely painful to be here and feel the tension. A lot of the time they take it out on me, calling me a 'failure,' 'worthless,' etc.

My girlfriend also lives with me. She's living with me because I live closer to the College she's going to than her parents did. Also, her family is... Not well off. They can save some extra money when she's away, and that's a good thing for them. Having her here adds a bit of tension, to be honest. I love living with her, but there are a ton of rules seeing as we're under my parent's roof. No sleeping together (separate rooms) being the most annoying of which (we're both adults). 

The tension in the house has gotten so strong. One night after coming home from work, I asked how my mother is. ""I'm pissed at you."" ""Why?""  
""Did you make a dental appointment?""  
""No, I haven't had time""  
""Did you scrape the driveway?""  
""No... I haven't had time""  
""Well why were you fucking your girlfriend last night then?""

At that point I almost snapped. 

That morning, I had to be at a morning meeting and went to bed really early in order to be rested. They knew this. Of course I didn't have sex with my girlfriend, we're more mature than that - we know not to mess with their rules when we're under their roof. 

I calmed myself down (had I not, I would have erupted in anger [again, not an angry person]) and reaffirmed that I had that morning meeting, informed her that we've been respecting their rules the whole time, that I've been really busy with work and that if I could, I would move the hell away; but can't. 

Lastly, I'm not terribly happy with my girlfriend situation. I love her, but there is a lot that's bugging me with it. I'm an only child, and one of my favorite things about that situation was the inherent privacy that came along with that. I get nearly none of that anymore. Eg: trying to spend some time alone reading, get jumped by her trying to 'play spook' me. .

I dislike my situation. I know it seems rather melodramatic and ""teeny,"" but I have never felt this stuck. I simply want to move away, move to the mountains for a while and work there; but I can't if I want to go to school next year. I want to be in a different city, one where there's less animosity from people I used to consider friends; but I can't. I simply want out, but can't...

Thanks if you read all that... It's kind of cathartic to get it all out there. Sorry if it made no sense.

**tl;dr:** Can't leave where I'm living if I want to do what I'm planning on doing, all while facing animosity from all directions and simply want out. ",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejtxm/in_a_situation_where_i_am_very_stuck_and_hate_it/,1292025910
ejw29,depression,DepressionEnd,I really need to sort my life out.,"I'm not sure what to do. My life is a complete mess.

I ""study"" at university. I can't go outside alone. I've been suffering from depression for years now, and have taken Fluoxitine for over 4 years.

I know there are personality problems with me, I just seem to be stuck in a rutt. I oversleep all the time; whenever I get less than 10 hours sleep in a day, I am constantly tired. It ruins my day. I need to be able to cope with less sleep, as I can't get to sleep if I haven't been awake for a longer period of time.

Because of a bunch of this, I miss lectures and tutorials. I get the feeling that my housemates/friends/people at university don't understand. I try my best to do exams/coursework without going to lectures/tutorials.

I'm lonely. I feel alone constantly. I had a girlfriend around 9months ago, but it turns out she was cheating on me with someone else and got rid of me. Most of all, I miss aving someone to talk to and someone to hug me at night.

I had a social night tonight. I left early because I felt ill. Didn't tell anyone because I didn't think they would care/didn't want to ruin their nights. Deliberated throwing myself into oncoming traffic. Chickened out as usual.

I just don't know what to do with myself.",13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ejw29/i_really_need_to_sort_my_life_out/,1292035074
ejxzn,depression,ImNumberOneExcept,I don't know what to do or if there is anything else to do...,"I'm not suicidal or anything but I really am pretty depressed and I needed to talk... it seemed like this is the place?

I got married about two years ago... Which I still think was the right choice, but it's been a lot harder one than I expected in many ways, mostly starting and ending with the fact that my husband's childhood and alcholic father messed up worse than I could possibly have realized at the time.

I didn't realize the extent to which he faked, rather than felt, normal human emotions, i.e. hurting me doesn't (usually) hurt him. Not that he wants to hurt me or anything, or that he tries to. It just doesn't bother him anymore than coloring outside the lines would. It's obviously wrong, but it's nothing that gets to him or anything.

You may think I'm dumb for not realizing this, but I know he does have some normal responses (like it hurts him when his mom is hurting or upset, or his brother, but I guess no one else) and I just couldn't believe it, I guess.

Alongside this, I am always the last thing to him. He says I am the first thing, but when it comes down to it, my needs are always last. It will always be made up to me later. I guess that makes it sound terrible. I don't mean to say that he wouldn't get up from the movie to get me a glass of water. He would. But if I really needed to spend time being close to him, and a friend wanted to come over and play a game, he'd have all kinds of reasons why he didn't feel comfortable saying no to the friend. If it is just him and me, it is fine, maybe even a little imbalanced (I do get to be first) but if there is anything else in the picture (work, friends, family, hobbies) I am last last last and he gets upset when I make a stand about it. And then we have a big fight and he admits at the end that he was being 100% irrational and doesn't seem to be just saying it, but the next time a situation comes up it goes almost exactly the same.

Anyway, he has been working on normal human emotions, he says he's been working on putting me first, but this has been going on so long now I am so emotionally fragile it really doesn't take much for me to have an emotional breakdown (it doesn't help that work is awful) and start screaming at him, the one surefire way to get him to stop blowing me off, but also a surefire way to make me feel like a harpy and a worthless human being.

I don't know what to do. I'm just trying to keep it together and find ways to get through to him without losing it, but it's so hard to do that I am never 100% relaxed or happy. And now that he is starting to realize that he is depressed too but that makes me more depressed... I don't know. I feel awful and I don't know what to do.

ekb4f,depression,[deleted],Am I in denial? I don't *think* I have depression...,"I've been having issues with feeling suicidal since seventh grade, attempted a few times and tend to go suicidal about once every three months. Most off this seems to be due to the fact that my life is just plain that shitty and NOT because of depression.

*Making friends and socializing IRL is so excessively difficult that I completely gave up on it a year or so ago, and my friends on the internet have a tendency to ask why I'm not asking my RL friends about my difficulties, or just to tell me to go make RL friends like any normal person. Either that or they think I'm trolling or lying.

*I have a bad relationship with my parents that may contribute to that, lots of serious trust issues and fears, and I don't think I can get any sort of medication without them figuring it out. That's kind of okay because

*I'm terrified that if I try to medicate with anything, I'll end up being dependent on it either in such a way that if I end up failing at life and not being able to pay for it, I'll spiral out of control or that the medication will be so effective that I won't give a shit about anything else anymore.

*I've been constantly exhausted and sick since the middle of high school due to massive overwork/overachieving that destroyed my immune system. To give an estimate, I have to sleep for 10-15 hours/day just to not be dead tired all the time, I cannot sprint for more than ~200 yards without serious consequences up to and including fainting, and even studying or doing homework frequently wears me out entirely. I've been tested for mono, HIV, anemia, thyroid stuff, and pretty much any other test you can get from piss and blood. Nada, so I assumed that I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which is what people get diagnosed with when they have real, severe, persistent medical symptoms but no underlying cause. I have not been diagnosed with CFS, however.

*I also have had severe difficulties with eating, not intentionally. A lot of the time, instead of feeling like ""oh yay its dinner time to eat,"" I feel like ""shit I have to eat food again? whyyyyyy..."" Food is not appealing in the slightest, and if I eat too much I tend to throw up. ""Too much"" could be anywhere from three bites onwards. I estimate that I eat what most people would consider about one and a half meals of food a day, and that's barely enough to stay on top of my hypoglycemia.

*After years and years of assuming that I had depression and getting a lot of flak from people who thought I was just throwing terms around for attention because I had not been diagnosed, I finally got myself tested for depression and came up...negative.

*Most of the symptoms I have could come from either CFS or depression or some third source. I don't think I have depression, but I can't really say that I have CFS without a diagnosis for the same reason that I couldn't say I had depression without testing (and turned out to be wrong)

*On the other hand, my boyfriend, mother, professors, dean, etc. keep trying to tell me that I *am* depressed and fuck the test results. Its getting really annoying but its making me question whether I have depression or not again.

*I also need to figure out wtf is going on pretty soon because I'm fairly sure that the way I'm currently living is not sustainable. Its hard as balls trying to pass all of my classes when I have no energy to devote to them, I stand even less a chance of being able to hold a job like this, and I can't help but wonder if I'm slowly starving myself to death by accident. Doctors are offering nothing but an endless series of blood tests to absolutely confirm beyond all doubt that I don't have anemia or whatever, therapist basically told me to go make some RL friends (which doesn't work). I'm scared for my future...",11,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekb4f/am_i_in_denial_i_dont_think_i_have_depression/,1292117295

ekfz8,depression,swatkins44,My revelation,"I have come to a revelation. It involves probably all of the most meaningful relationships in my life right now. I started college desperate for
new beginnings and tried my hardest to impress people by acting like 'the man'. Everyone decided I was a douchebag and hated me.I eventually 
say fuck it, and go back the the me that my highschool friends walked all over because at least it was still me. People notice a change and warm
up a little but I didn't get all that close to anyone. Fast forward about 5-6 months into the future when we are supposed to be looking for new
living arrangements I was having trouble finding someone who would room with me. I was still the outcast. The leftover noone wanted. I ended up 
one day asking Sean and TJ what they were doing. Their answer: We don't know, a lot of people have been asking. ME: Oh. Alright. That's fine. 
Maybe a week or less later, walking with Sean, TJ, and Ben from basketball. I ask the same thing. They tell me they don't know what they are 
doing and all their lottery numbers for on campus living selection are crap. I happened to have gotten a very good number in the lotto and tell them. Ben's reaction: Oh nice! We've 
been wondering where we would get another roommate! We'll get a suite style! Sean+TJ's reaction: They look at eachother in sort of dismay, obviously 
thinking that they did not want to room with me, but now that Ben ran his mouth they would be forced to. They acknowledge the idea but never 
really endorse or deny it. Their voices sound like death and I die a little inside. I am friends with Ben because my lottery number got us into 
better housing while Steph, Leigh, Sean, and TJ all warm up to me because they now know that I will be around them more than they had

eki5k,depression,[deleted],"18 years old, living downtown with Aspergers, overwhelming feelings of worry, sadness, anger. Music is the only thing I cling onto for any hope for the future.","The title pretty much summarises it.

I just got out of foster care/group homes June of this year. I was put in those homes against my will at 17 when my parents selfishly ""kicked me out"" for my behavior. I was on a cocktail of medication, including Abilify and Lexapro, that slowed my mind down and altered my way of thinking. I had no way of expressing myself and the only way for me to get to them was by acting out. I was never violent and never had any intention to harm anyone, even though my parents constantly exaggerated that I was ""threatening"" them, which is of course bullshit.

I went to four homes and all four of them treated me like a child no more than 10. I shared my residence with other people who were way more disabled than I was (none of them were even close to my level of functionality) and I was also denied internet access for 3/4 of a year because I had a ""history of viewing porn online"". (I was 18 by then, what crap) One staff worker was emotionally abusive and at times actually lied about my behavior to make me look violent. I was never able to speak for myself, no one would listen willfully and always sided with my caretakers no matter what.

I finally reached my absolute breaking point with this indescribable horseshit and successfully ran to Portland after two other attempts which ended with even more things taken. I guess my dense-headed parents finally realized that I wasn't meant to be in group homes for mentally retarded people and arranged an apartment paid with my Social Security. And here I am. 

I went off my antidepressants since I moved in. I'm way more clear-minded and functional than when I was taking them. However I just don't know what to do. I never had a job that lasted more than two weeks. It's hard for me to work, I don't feel capable and I can't imagine myself ever waking up on time to go.

I want to die. I don't want to kill myself (hence r/depression instead of r/suicidewatch) but I would love to just get out of here and not having to worry about the future, past, anything. The problem is made more intense with Aspergers. I don't have any friends who I hang out with in real life. If I were saying this to an actual person's face, it wouldn't be able to cover a quarter of this. My speech slurs/stutters and it seems I'm never able to say things correctly the first time.

What can I do? I'm a musician who has always dreamed big, always so excited about the newest song I make, but even that's starting to fade. On YouTube I count my views in 10s, not 100,000s.

I'm at a standstill and I just don't know what to do from here on. I have a lot of dreams but I rarely have the motivation to act on them; it's very inconsistent and always depends on my ever-changing mood.

Can you guys help me? What can I do to make living more bearable? How can I feel better, do better, be better?",4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eki5k/18_years_old_living_downtown_with_aspergers/,1292165302
eklcz,depression,throwaway-depression,Do I have depression?,"Throwaway account.

I think I may be suffering from depression, but I'm not sure. I have a fear of going to the GP only for them to say ""You're being silly, get over yourself"".

Here's some background information on my life. I've felt the symptoms of depression for around 6 months now. Before that I ran a web development company with little sucess. One of my clients moved one of his clients over to me (he is a web developer too). I couldn't deliver and just left never to return. I know this is a dick move, but I just couldn't deal with not completing. I just freeze up, unable to think or do anything and start worrying about everything else. My thoughts run wild inside my head and I end up worrying myself into depression.

I have been unemployed for a year after I closed my company. I started looking for jobs and had 2 interviews for which I got job offers for both. I recently started at one of the companies (small startup) near where I live and thought I'd be happy. The code was really bad and I had a hard time enjoying it so I left (even though money is getting low). I've just felt really ""depressed"" since I left, around a month ago now.

I should be happy; Got two job offers with great salaries for the interviews I had, in a time where getting a job is difficult too. I just feel downright miserable.

I think it's clear to me I have a problem with dealing with stress, but is it worth going to my doctor about? Normal people would just get on with it, but cripples me for months.

It's ruined my life, I can't hold down a job, I've pushed friends away and now I'm really looking for some advice so I can recover.

ekp1u,depression,apatheticandpathetic,"Apathy, futility and tears. I don't know what to do.","I felt like being creative so I decided I'd try to write some sort of short story. Then I realised I was writing about myself, so I decided to ditch it and just get some things out of my mind. I have no idea what to do with myself and when I think of ways to improve that, I just feel overwhelmed. Anyway, here's what I wrote:

I want to die. I’m not suicidal, I just often fantasise about a convenient way out. Perhaps a nice nuclear war that we wouldn’t know about until, well, I guess we wouldn’t know at all, death would be there before the realisation set in. It’s that realisation that I’d like to avoid. Suicide forces the realisation upon you; it leaves you with the decision to make and the knowledge of potential consequence. While I’m too scared and aware to do it myself, I don’t particularly enjoy living, and that’s the problem. It feels like a waste of time, and yes I’m aware of the contradictory nature of that statement. Time is our own creation, one that I’d like to give up. 

I’m happy at times too, but it’s always fleeting, and it’s always full of self-doubt. Hey, there’s a girl, she’s pretty, I’ll talk to her. I hope she liked me. Should I ask her out? Ah, I’ll just do it; I doubt she’ll say yes. She agreed, I hope she doesn’t cancel. She’ll probably come up with an excuse. She’s here. It went great. Why didn’t I kiss her though, now she won’t want to see me again. I’ll ask her out again regardless. Cool, she’s coming over to my place. We kissed! A few times. When she went to leave we hugged and kissed again.

Then came the fleeting happiness. It lasted about twenty minutes. I just sat there, completely content. Happy about how things had gone and pleased about how I assumed they’d go in the future. The self-doubt soon set in. Did she kiss me out of pity? Was it because she didn’t want to turn me down after accepting a second date? Why wasn’t she particularly forward, even after I kissed her? And it starts. Over and over. Now I’m just sat here after an exchange with her, where it’s clear she doesn’t want a relationship. 

My thought process soon turns to how futile everything is. Why get a job, why meet people, why live? Why try and improve things when it all just results in crushing disappointment, every single time. What is it that makes me different to everyone else? I say everyone else in the loosest possible way, I know plenty have the same thoughts and feelings but there’s something comforting in believing you’re alone in your pain. I guess it’s a sense of feeling special. You don’t enjoy yourself like others, but man, you’re so unique. Let’s go further and say you’re better than them. Your worldview is just so enlightened that society is lagging behind. Yet they seem to be the ones having fun. Who get joy out of such pathetic, to me anyway, activities. While I sit here crying and writing this. 

After however many months pass the hurt from this girl rejecting me will disappear. The nothingness will return and I’ll go back to my old routines. I might do well at the weekend in my chosen sport and for an hour or two I’ll feel like a hero, then I’ll get home and realise that the week awaits and I’m a mindless slave.

ekp57,depression,iwant2see,"This might not be absolutely relevant, but I could use some insight from folks around here (kind of long)","I'm not really...depressed or sad. But I've recently come to the realization that the world is a terrible, AWFUL place. That people are terrible. And that nothing anyone does sparks any sort of hope in me. Not all the 'donate/play for charity' or 'i helped out a stranger in need' or 'i sent a little girl a present' posts in the world could get me to think that the world is not a terrible place. Politicians, corporations, millionaires, the supposed 'top 2%'...they are what run this world. They are the ones that make the decisions. They have the money, and therefore the power. It's mostly true. 

Which brings me to my next point- where the hell do I fit in? Where do i fit in all of this? what is stopping me from just offing myself right now, and not caring about what others think? I have family with whom i barely talk to (weird grudges from childhood) and a boyfriend who, for all intents and purposes, is a really really nice person but someone that I just don't know how to talk to. I don't know how to tell him how I feel. he's supportive, and willing to stand by me, but I don't know how to react to that. nothing seems to effect me anymore. He tells me he loves me but I don't know what to say to that...

I don't have very many friends. I don't really even _want_ to socialize. I just don't know how I matter in this world in which everyone is out to do things only for themselves. They're selfish. Everyone is, to an extent. How do I stop believing that everyone is selfish? History has shows time and again that people will always be the same. What good does living do? I don't have a job, I don't even want one, and I just kind of want to be left alone. But at the same time...I sort of want to get over this. I just don't know how. 

Nothing motivates or propels me. I'm going to go broke soon, and I still haven't snapped to my senses and realize I need a job. But for what? Living in this terrible place that offers nothing in return? Living in the same economic level as I always was? I'm too scared to kill myself, but...I'll starve soon, yet still won't realize that I need a job and money. but to what end. argh, fuck. 

What the hell do I do? Someone who has been through this, please tell me what to do. I'm so numb to everything now. I can't ask anyone for help...my parents don't live anywhere near me and my boyfriend is swamped with his own problems. I need to get out of this rut.

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and mild agoraphobia. 

That's not why I'm scared though. Yesterday, shit suddenly got real. I feel extremely low, nothing makes me smile and I keep contemplating suicide. I've been bursting into tears at random intervals, and for no reason. This came on so rapidly, I'm honestly terrified that I'm going crazy or having some sort of psychotic break. I just walked outside and felt like something was coming to get me. I had to turn back and sprint inside, and even then I feel like I only barely escaped whatever was watching me. 

I'm seriously so scared. I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I need, I don't know, insight? Or at least some reassurance that I'm not losing it. I don't want to go insane. :(

ekysj,depression,nior_labotomy,Is this guilt I feel over possibly being depressed normal?,"Firstly, I have not seen anyone professionally. Why? I'm not sure, maybe it's the stigma, maybe I'm just stubborn, not sure. That's why the headline says ""possibly"", I have not been professionally diagnosed as depressed. I cannot, however, think of anything else this is.

I'm a 29 year old male, and have been feeling this way for a long time now, probably since at least high school. However, I've really noticed it more so in the last 18 months, since my girlfriend of 3+ years broke up with me for someone else. That was probably one of the hardest things in my life to deal with, I went to a really dark place for a few months. It felt like the world collapsed in on me. Since then, it feels like there have been problems on top of problems, and nothing has been going my way. I've done things to try and over come, I've started working out more, and have lost 50 pounds in the process, tried taking up more hobbies. These things have helped bring me back a bit, but there's just this residual sadness. This is where my question comes in.

I know when it comes down to it, my problems are insignificant, I think about how much worse off other people have it. I live in the richest country in the world, I have a job, a roof over my head, I have my family and friends in my life that care about me. I know there are millions, hell, probably billions of people in this world have it so much more worse than me, and have real problems. So I feel guilty for complaining about things like relationships and all my tiny little problems.

This is part of the reason why I haven't seen anybody about these feelings that have been picking me apart. I just think to myself, ""whatever, those aren't real problems. At least you know where you're going to sleep tonight. Get over it.""

I don't get over it, and these feelings keep festering, so now, not only do I have this fairly crippling sadness, but I have guilt over it too. This is no way for a person to live. 

Are there more people out there like me? Did you ""get over it""? If so, how?",5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekysj/is_this_guilt_i_feel_over_possibly_being/,1292239852
el034,depression,[deleted],"I have a 15-year-old friend, who is struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide. Unfortunately, it appears to me her parents are amplifying a bad situation, and they hold all the keys to her happiness. I would really appreciate anyone's thoughts or ideas... I'm really struggling here.","I have a friend, X, who is 15. She is struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide. I would really like for her to get help, but her parents don't seem to listen to or understand her needs. I really really would like some help figuring out what to do in this situation. 

She is currently attending school away from (her parent's) home, staying at an uncle's house much closer to the school. The school is a hard-to-get-in, generally great school. However X struggles making friends with the type of people who attend a hard-to-get-in school.

X is dating a boy who is 18, but who approached X's parents before asking her to date him, so as to get their approval. They appreciated the gesture and allowed the relationship, however, X's parent's first reaction to any attempt to stay home from school, or any other thing they don't want, is to not allow X to see her boyfriend anymore. Because X wanted to quit her softball team, X's mother called X's boyfriend (on his birthday) and told him he could no longer date X. However he decided to stay with her, and after a few months, her parents accepted that they were dating again, allowing them to be together and inviting X's boyfriend over for dinner again. They are generally on good terms at the moment. 

Because of X's distance from her boyfriend, her only opportunity to see her boyfriend is on the weekends when she is at her parent's house. If she has done anything that does not please her parents during the week, she is not allowed to see her boyfriend at all for that week. This includes things like cleaning her room and loading the dishwasher. In my opinion these are trivial things for her parents to hold her boyfriend over her head, but please correct me if I am wrong. This seems to be one the biggest issues she mentions when she discusses why she is so depressed (she would like to see her boyfriend more often, and often her parents block her ability to do so, with no regard to her feelings). 

Her mother off-handedly refers to X (in her presence) as evil, horrible, and selfish on a regular every-day basis. X's mother rarely shows affection (at least I have never seen any) with the exception of buying her clothes from high-end designer stores. 

In addition, in my opinion, they don't show her they trust her at all, often going through her things (makeup bag, school bag, dresser drawers, even guessing her password going into her computer and reading her AIM logs). A few times they have found marijuana-related things, but most often they find nothing, and it leaves X feeling depressed and lonely afterwards. They don't seem to think that any of her grievances are founded and her mother has said ""I won't EVER stop snooping through your stuff, because I love you because I'm your mother"" verbatim. 

In response to this, X has gone through her parents things, finding marijuana and paraphenalia in her parent's bedroom. This is another reason that she feels as if she is disrespected. X has even said to her mother ""if dad can do it, why can't I"" to which her mother responded ""I don't care what he does, I care what you do"". I feel like this situation could be handled differently, but I don't know exactly how. 

Recently after a day-long trip in the car with her family, X got into a fight with her little brother (apparently) because of backseat sibling rivalry over video game systems. X's parents stopped the car, so that everyone (little brother, mother, and father) could yell at her, tell her she was selfish and awful. X responded by saying ""I want to die! I wish I could just kill myself!"" which caused her parents to (understandably) freak out. 

X's parents brought her to a mental hospital to be evaluated. Before bringing her, they made her pack a ""hospital"" bag of clothes for when she was admitted. Evidently she was evaluated, and the doctor told her parents that she should be admitted. X argued with her parents, eventually convincing them to let her be in her own home during her birthday (which was in 3 days). She would have been admitted for a week. 

Since then, whenever she misbehaves or talks back, they threaten her with returning to the hospital so that she can be committed. Since the hospital they have also been giving her anti-depression medicine. However, she still tells me she has thoughts of suicide and killing herself, so that her parents would ""understand the pain"" they ""put her through"". Because of the hospital trip, she cannot share any of these feelings with anyone but a few close friends, however.

Recently, her parents found a towel with blood on it, from a nosebleed, and assumed she was cutting herself. Her mom yelled at her about it, and when she said it was from a nosebleed she said ""it doesn't look like a nosebleed! I swear to god!""

It seems to me even if she were cutting herself, yelling at her probably would not be the correct response. This is the attitude they seem to take with everything regarding X.

So, thank you for allowing me to vent a little. But please, I really would value ANY ideas, or perceptions, or any help anyone could offer. I'm really at a loss. The parents don't seem to understand that their behavior could possibly impact her depression, and she has been explaining that is one of the #1 reasons she is considering suicide. 

Her mother is currently attending a therapist with her, but apparently the therapist never talks to X one-on-one (the mother is always in the room). So far, all I have heard of the therapist is that he has prescribed the anti-depression drugs. It seems to me he could be a valuable resource, but X simply views him as a tool of her parents.

I'm not talking about a clichéd, romanticized version where I tell my parents I'm leaving and pack a slanket in a sleeping bag and spend the night at my friends house. No. I'm 23 years old for jeebus' sake. I don't live with my parents.

I live alone. I work for a mobile software development company but I'm no programmer. I'm heavy on the left brain. And I might be bipolar but I've never been diagnosed.

I'm completely underwhelmed with my life and I need some serious change. What's the worse that could happen if I withdrew all seven grand from my checking account, filled up my tank and just started driving? I'd write my parents a nice, ""I'll be back in an undetermined amount of time"" note and give my work the two weeks notice. Cancel my cards. Cancel my services. Breaking my lease would ruin my credit...

And therein lies the problem. Running away requires too much preparation. FUCKING OCD.

Any suggestions. Can I follow through with this?

Thanks in advance.

**Edit:** Wow guys. Thanks for the advice. These are really legit suggestions. For the record, I do have some trouble planning, or being decisive about potentially life-altering decisions such as these. The reddit community truly astounds me. Thank you again!!!

I'll try to keep it short and to a point.

A few years ago I was acquainted with a new group of real life friends. We've been pretty much inseparable ever since.

Just before I joined the the group, one of them had dropped out of school. About 4 years have passed since then, and his life has just been spiraling downwards. He has no interest in the things that motivate other people through life and is now up to a point where he barely ever leaves his home. He lives with his mother, who is also severely depressed. His parents separated a long time ago and his father is an alcoholic.

Through the years, we've all tried to motivate him. We got him to enroll at our school for 3 semesters in a row, and did everything we could to make it easy for him, including picking him up in the morning and driving him home in the afternoon. But it never lasted and he always stopped showing up after a few weeks. We've also offered him jobs several times but he's never interested. We always try to bring him along when we do something, but he usually declines. When we manage to convince him to join us he usually has a blast. The only sure way to get him to show up is by hosting a LAN party, which is a rare occurrence nowadays.

I know that he's been on some psychoactive drugs as well as sleeping pills for years. He's also been seeing a psychiatrist through the years, but I don't know if it's a regular thing.

I'm very worried about my friend. His life is a vicious cycle of computer use and sleep. His parents are useless. If this doesn't stop, I think it's inevitable that he will commit suicide at some point.

Reddit, I love my friend and I want to help him. Please tell me how.

emcc1,depression,throwaway2021,I had a breakdown last night,"tl;dr I'm alone for the first time in years and it's made me the lowest I've ever been in my life. 

Where to start....well it all started when my gf of 5 and a half years cheated on me and we broke up. That was 6 months ago now and I know I can't keep dwelling on that but it still feels like a bad nightmare that just won't end. 

The first two months were bad because it was the middle of summer and I had nothing to do except sit around and think about everything. When school started back I got better. I had plenty of things to keep me occupied and engaged so my mind didn't wander very often. By the time the end of the semester came around I was going great. But now school is out and I'm sitting around with nothing to do again. 

A group (about 8 people) of our friends always get together on Sundays to eat, watch a movie, and just hangout because that's the one day every week we can all get to see each other.  Then the breakup happened and we both kept going to the Sunday get togethers. I tried for a couple of weeks but I just couldn't do it. I couldn't stand seeing my ex and knowing all the stuff that had happened, I couldn't pretend everything was fine. So I stopped going. She still goes every week. I barely see any of my friends anymore and I feel like she's stolen them from me too. I never get invited when they go out because my ex and the guy she cheated on me with always goes with them and they know I don't want to be around either of them. 

I try to invite my other friends to do things but they rarely ever do. And again, I never get invited when they do anything. I try to include everyone so they'll include me but it never happens. I have a couple of long distance friends that I talk to almost daily and that's about all that gets me through the days right now. I'll stay up to 3 or 4 in the morning talking to them or surfing reddit because I don't want to go to sleep.

I'm afraid to go to sleep. Because as soon as I turn the computer off my mind goes into overdrive replaying everything about the breakup. And I know I'll have dreams with her in them where everything is fine. I'll wake up from them and I'll just ball up in my bed and cry until I go back to sleep. 

I've tried to change things. I've gotten new clothes, taken up personal projects, started working out, ect. But I just feel unfulfilled. I'm going through the motions of recovering because that's what I'm supposed to do, but they don't seem to help much. I just need to be around people that want to be around me. Anyway, that's my story, thanks for listening.

emkhi,depression,majorlydisappointed,"Not feeling understood, and wanting to dump those who aren't trying to understand","I've been through a series of five betrayals, all tied into one incident. I'm making progress (with therapy and EMDR) on the feelings, but I'm having trouble with a social side-aspect of the situation.

As an example, I was with a good friend and his wife at their home recently. The wife started talking about a business she wants to start, and that she was planning to hire (betrayer #4) as the office manager. I interrupted her, because hearing her say these positive things about #4 was hurtful - I thought she had understood how I felt about that person.  She asked ""You're _still_ mad at #4?"", and said ""You're putting me in a difficult position.""

First of all - I don't like being blamed for not wanting to hear about #4 as per the last comment.

I feel very frustrated about the question - from my point of view, I was betrayed by 3 people, and down at one of the lowest points of my life, and #4 and #5 kicked me some more. They were not directly involved, and I thought they had been good friends and would show me some compassion, whether they agreed with my perspective or not. That pushed me over the edge to suicidal.

Asking whether I'm _still_ mad at the people who treated me without compassion and without regard to my welfare to that extent? Well, _DUH_.

I thought my friend's wife understood this. We've been over the situation enough, but she seems to feel like I should have just a bit of anger, rather than the trauma I experienced it as.

The reason I interrupted her was because I was developing a strong feeling that I wanted to get up and leave their house and never talk to either of them again. Even though I managed to stop the thought at the time, I'm thinking that again now. Thinking that if these people ""just don't get it"", then I need to forget about keeping such friends and move on.

Oh yes, and all 5 people took the approach of ""You're not being the way I want you to be, so we're not going to talk with you"".  I _thought_ that kind of passive-aggressive attack would be socially unacceptable in the group I associate with, but apparently that is not the case. Since I'm very focused around resolving problems, people who won't talk are the most infuriating thing I can imagine. I'm guessing they're used to people yelling at them or something, but in my case they've taken what would have been simple to resolve, and escalated my frustration to traumatic levels. At the peak, I rated ""Major Depressive Episode"" on the ICD-10.

emp5y,depression,randrews,I hate Christmas,"I'm a guy in my late 20s, in a long-term relationship, with a good job, and I don't live with anyone abusive. I have it a lot better than some other people on here. I spent most of this year learning how to manage my depression through therapy, antidepressants (which I'm off now), and some life changes (getting rid of people who treated me really badly).

I was doing pretty well until just recently, when I fell back into the pit *hard.* There were a couple of triggers, both having to do with Christmas.

Last Christmas I got really depressed too. And the one before, and the one before that. Almost every Christmas my mind finds something to torture me about, usually related to money.

**I hate Christmas.**

* I don't get the presents I want, and then I feel guilty for being unhappy about that, because I don't think I have a right to. I feel bad and then I feel worse for feeling bad.

* I don't spend Christmas with my family any more, because when I did it was horrible. Christmas is a day when everyone but me has a place they belong, and I have an empty apartment and all the restaurants are closed.

* I've been an atheist as long as I remember (although I only owned up to it this year), so the whole religious aspect leaves me cold.

* I like buying other people presents, it just makes me really uncomfortable / angry at myself when people buy me things. I feel uncomfortable / angry at myself across most of the season actually.

* Stores where I want to go to buy things (like cable ties, or books) get overrun by hordes of idiots. I like going to the mall and just walking around, and I can't do that in the month of December.

**Edit:** Oh yeah, and insipid Christmas music. I'm prone to getting songs in my head, so the first time someone plays Jingle Bells at me, it's all over for at least a month.

emteb,depression,[deleted],Does anyone have a problem with tolerance?,"Almost every drug I've taken, with the exception of SSRIs, I almost develop an immediate tolerance to. I have severe anxiety, insomnia, major depression, and a few personality disorders in the mix.

No antihistamines work on me for my insomnia. Diphenhydramine? Good luck if I get to sleep with less than 500mg. I hallucinate pretty badly at that point. I switched to the Z-drugs. Ambien and the such. They worked for a while, but eventually I developed a tolerance and ended up with a vivid hallucination that let me drive down a highway believing that I was wirelessly communicating with every person in the world.

After that, I tried all of the benzos for my insomnia. Xanax worked for a while. After I got to 3mg, my psych stopped me. She switched me to Seroquel. 50mg worked for about 3 days. 75mg for another 2 days. 100mg for another two days. 150mg didn't work. So, we decided on some last ditch options.

Chloral Hydrate. My miracle sleep aid. 5mg/1tsp a night. It worked phenomenally for about 1 week. Then I had to bump it up to 2 tsp. Then another week, about 4 tsp. Then my psych stopped me because I was apparently around the threshold of respiratory arrest. Then I moved to a different state and am waiting on a psych appointment.

Currently I'm on nothing. I sleep roughly an hour a day, and the only thing besides barbiturates I can imagine is Xyrem. Is there any chance I could form a resistance to Xyrem?",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/emteb/does_anyone_have_a_problem_with_tolerance/,1292509747

I've tried all that I can short of dumping him in a hospital. We don't have any money and he is the one that has to call Community Mental Health if he wants to get any benefits (I've called and tried myself but they keep saying they need to talk to him). He's also the one that needs to make the appointment. I've been patient. I've bought him books that he doesn't read. I've tried to get him to go to places for short amounts of time. I've tried telling him the things that worked for me hoping he would try some of it. He just says things like ""what works for you won't work for me"" with out trying any of it. I've tried ignoring it and him and just trying to get on with my own life. I've tried recruiting friends to help and he just refuses them as well. He just seems to be getting worse no matter what I do. 

I've been agoraphobic. I know it's hard. I know it sucks. But I did get better. I read. I talked to people. I made an effort to change my thinking. He doesn't go out. He smokes pot and plays video games with his best friend who just enables him. He doesn't try new things. He makes excuses why not to go out. His words tell me that his thinking hasn't changed. He doesn't tell me what his real feelings or thoughts are.

He used to have dreams of being something. He used to want to be a lawyer. He used to want to go out and do things. He used to want to show me off to the public- no matter who they were because he was proud to be seen with me. Now he's too scared to be seen at all.

We fight all the time now and he usually blames me for not doing something right. I'm becoming pretty severely depressed myself. I feel like I'm the reason he's getting worse and feel like the only way he'll get better is if I'm gone. He can deal with it on his own without someone to blame. He won't have any one to nag him to go out. Plus it will help me because then I don't have to sit by and watch him rot. I can get things done for myself. 

I'm really torn on what to do. If I stay, everything could just keep getting worse, for both of us, or it could get better. He should have support, but I don't know how much longer I can hold out. I don't know who to turn to. I feel like I'm out of options.

emx45,depression,LastVestigesofHope,The Life that Never Was,"Where to begin?  I guess I'll start with why I'm writing this.  I'm not composing this to garner sympathy or pity from reddit. I think I'm creating this post out of some subconscious yearning to vent.  Whether or not this goes unread or makes the front page, opening up feels good.

If anyone actually reads this, you must understand my history to have any insight into my situation

I am a 20 year old white male, I've always been introverted, and have shunned social activity for the pursuit of knowledge.  I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have could hardly be called such.  I am your classic ""forever alone-er"", and have never had a girlfriend, much less had sex.  I spent almost all of high school in my basement playing computer games and learning.  I have a tremendous drive to learn; a day doesn't go by when I don't verse myself in a previously unknown topic.

I am generally well-liked by my peers (those who get to know me), but I've always felt that a chasm exists between me and most ""normal"" people.  I feel entirely out of place when having conversations with groups of friends.  I'm that kid that ruins the curve on tests, and the one everyone always asks to write papers for them.  While i can study an hour before a final exam and receive a 100 on it, I cannot engage in small talk with girls or strangers for the life of me.

I would consider myself a good person.  I will always help someone with their homework if they ask, I share my weed/booze without expectation of reciprocation.  I've never been arrested, nor gotten anything more than detention.

I've traveled quite a bit, and have been to most of the countries in Western Europe, Australia, Mexico, etc...  I am a certified SCUBA diver, and I have dove around the world.

Everyone has their faults, and mine seem to override any skills or accomplishments i have.  I not an attractive person, and am 6-1 240 lbs (I have lost 60 lbs since coming to college 2 years ago), and a complete lack of self confidence makes me wholly undesirable to the opposite sex.

I guess this is where the disconnect originates from.  Everyone has some primal urge for intimacy.  Personally, it is more of a maddening call.  My inability to conform has left me standing out in the cold for 20 years.

My disenfranchisement stems from the realities of the world.  I won't have a beautiful girlfriend, and I won't be the most popular.  Why play the game at all if you have no chance of winning?  I am not blameless for this, however.  How do I expect someone else to look past my face and body and see the true me, when I cannot do the same for them?  My own hypocrisy is further reason to divorce myself from the system.

I have stopped going to class, and will fail every single one of my subjects.  If, by some miracle, I am allowed to return to school, I will be moving into a single dorm so I can isolate myself from human contact.  If I'm not allowed back, I don't know what I'll do.  I was suppose to join my parents and siblings as lawyers, but that dream is almost completely extinguished.

I have contemplated suicide, but the ends are not all that attractive.  Death holds eternal nothingness, or Hell.  The emotional anguish it would cause my family is perhaps the greatest reason to not do it.  I hold onto the fact that eventually... everyone dies.  Every day I live is one less day that I have here on earth, and that puts a smile on my face.

So I slip into the abyss, it's where I'm comfortable, and it's where I will wait for nature to kill me.  I have no joy left in my life; I used to tell myself it would get better, but it doesn't.

* I have important work to do

* There's a 10€ cover charge, and since I wouldn't want to stick around for long

en2z4,depression,[deleted],Apart of me says hold on another part says whats the use its only getting worse.,"For the past 4 years I have gone in and out of depression. Many times wishing to die and wanting to commit suicide. I have made many mistakes in my life. Many that I regret and many I wish never happened. I am constantly reminded all around me, every day and ever where, of the many consequences of my stupid actions. I wont go into details because I dont want anyone to recognize me. Well this brings me to my title and why I am conflicted at this moment. Recently I decided to turn my life around (again) but this time it will work! I say. This time I know if I work as hard as I can good things will happen and maybe just maybe I can be okay. As this all begins everything now is catching up to me. Things that I forgot about and thought were over but are not anymore. It seems as i'm picking up the pieces one last time everything and everyone has come together to oppose my last effort. It seems that even luck is not on my side. It seems that in my last effort to break free of depression and go after my third chance at life. Life is doing everything it can to shut me down once and for all.
At this moment i'm scared because I am trying so hard so very hard to make something of my life. But i'm so afraid of falling again. I don't know if I can pick myself back up this time.

en34s,depression,sadbastard6886,I really need someone to talk to right now,"I posted this in /r/offmychest, but I haven't really had any meaningful responses and I just need someone to connect with right now... even if it is virtual.

Throwaway. About 6 months ago, I ended a 6 year relationship with my fiance (I am a 25M). We were perfect together. Truth be told, the split was completely crushing-- but that's a story I don't want to go into. In a nutshell, we split because of life circumstances, not because of any relationship problems... so there are still very strong feelings on both sides... its a miserable situation, but something I'm slowly starting to understand.

On the surface I'm sure I seem like I have all my shit together. I'm working toward my PhD at a major research university, I'm in a band, I have friends... but as soon as I get home everyday I start with the self-medicating-- booze, drugs, anything to numb the pain of living without this woman I thought I would spend my life with. It's so typical, but I go through cycles of happy/sad, happy/sad, over and over again. I think a lot about suicide-- not necessarily about going through with it, just thinking about it a lot. Thinking about death a lot. And for the first time in my life I feel the very real grip of depression tightening around my throat. It really is a suffocating feeling, isn't it? It isn't currently debilitating though, as I have this uncanny ability to turn emotionally cold temporarily when I need to focus on school or whatever various bullshit responsibilities someone in my situation has to deal with. But no matter how hard I try to push this out of my mind, to talk about it with people who care about me, I just can't shake this underlying sadness that seems to follow me everywhere.

I'm often in company but I always feel alone. And most of the people I try to reach out to don't understand because, to them, I have all my shit together. It's getting harder and harder to get out of bed each morning, and I guess I was just looking to write this out and maybe talk to somebody who knows how I feel. I've dated others since her, but I find myself pretending they are her-- basically using these girls (and that's all they are... girls...). I know its a bonehead move, but that brief moment of fantasy where, in my mind, I have her back in my bed really helps me get through the days. I don't like the person I am becoming, and I need to get a grip, but that's easier said than done.

Basically, I feel like I have this magnificent ability to hide how I'm feeling behind the guise of ""success,"" and it makes it hard for me to explain to people how miserable I am. It's almost like nobody believes me-- and I feel this sense of guilt... why should I be so blue when life is going so well right now? I'm mad at myself for being so weak.

encv9,depression,MissingKel,All about Kel: A verbose vent and a relatively lost guy,"Greetings, reddit.  Made a throwaway for no particularly discernible reason other than to give me no reason not to post this.

I do not ordinarily make habit of publicizing my thoughts, problems, or conflicts, but the presence of this subreddit has been nagging at me for days (perhaps weeks) now.  I do not frequently talk about myself at all, really, so this is going to be very awkward for me, and it's likely to show.  Also, I'm incredibly verbose... it's hard not to be, for some reason, so I also apologize for 'the book'.  This is perhaps to be more a rant than anything else, but I feel that I do need some guidance.

I am a 21-year old gay male, tall, not overweight but not particularly in shape either.  I'm certainly more logical than emotional, and in my relatively limited experiences with the world of 'feelings', I've found that not a whole lot matters to me.  This isn't to say that I've always been depressed as much as it says that I've never felt I had the capacity to be until now.  I'm an avid programmer, by hobby and for work, and I find I spend a lot of time working on my computer, and online, but not so much that it eclipses other aspects of my life.

In early 2006, I met a group of people in an online game and talked with them quite a bit.  A few of them became very good friends, over time, having met 2 of them in person later, and having the other eventually become a long-term business partner.  The third and final person of note was a very creative and 'feisty' (for lack of a better word) 18-year old (at the time) girl who, for the purposes of remaining semi-anonymous, I'll refer to as Kel.  If any of you have read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, you might know what I mean when I say she was very much like YT, in personality.

Kel had an unfortunate medical condition which, for the good part of her life, has kept her severely underweight, weak, and generally unable to be very physically active.  Her family was caring for her.

Kel and I would talk about all manner of things, but most of the time, it would come back to 'the future'... there was hope in the future for her to become more physically capable and mobile, and she and I shared a lot of common desires for the future; most notably, we both wanted to travel a great deal.  Travel is a fairly juvenile 'dream' but undeniably an alluring one.

Over time, we developed plans to travel around the US, by road.  For months and months we would talk about all the normal topics.. life, the universe, boys, girls, anything and everything.  We grew very close, over time.  ""Cosmic twins,"" she would call us.

Fast-forward to early 2010: there appeared the opportunity of a potentially dangerous surgery that would correct most of her medical problems and leave her more mobile and capable of achieving her (our) dreams.  She was apprehensive, understandably, as was her family.  Other friends and I encouraged her to make her own decision.  Eventually, it was decided that she would rather try and fail than simply die without having tried (inevitably, she would have succumbed to medical complications if she chose NOT to perform the surgery.)

Late 2009, she enters the hospital for one of many procedures preparing her for a surgery.  I lie awake at night, every night, waiting to hear that she's alright.  She is.  Over the next few weeks, though, she's in and out of the hospital for a variety of relatively minor complications.  Then, all seems to be fine, and they move on to the next stage.  This, however, does not seem to go as planned.  There are a myriad of complications and for the next 3-4 months, she is once again in-and-out of the hospital... eventually being more in than out.  We stay in communication frequently by text message, though the frequency of messages went down over time.

In June 2010, I receive a message from her family, notifying me that she had passed away peacefully due to medical complications resulting from the 'second stage'.  And, I suppose, this event in particular is the real center of the problems I'm coming to you about now.

The following months, all the way up to the present day, have been some of the most confusing and depressing months I have ever experienced, which is an incredibly strange thing to hear myself say.  If you knew me, you might agree.

I loved Kel more than I have any other person, and more than I'm likely to ever love anyone again, which is entirely confusing to me on so many levels.  I have previously experienced loss in my life, of people who were close to me (my mother, all four grandparents), but nothing has compared to this.  Being a relatively unemotional person, I found those losses to be significant events, but I don't think I've ever been devastated quite like I have been at the loss of Kel.  Even thinking about it is somehow causing an involuntary tremble like that I experienced when I first received the news... something I've never felt before.

Everything I do in my life reminds me of her and that she's gone.  All my goals are gone- to travel without her would be dull, to design ones own house would be unimportant, to meet new people would be pointless.  I fully recognize that this altered perspective is being forced upon me by my depression at suffering a personal loss, but the logical understanding of that is lost on me.  My life has ground to a halt and there feels to be no reason to move forward.

Being a very logical person, I've understood that if I can work through this, my perspective will change for the better and I won't regret doing it.. but my emotions don't care about logic, and despite my best attempts, they seem to be ruling over me more than I'd like to let them.

This long-winded post simultaneously adequately describes my situation and doesn't do Kel justice as I've described her.  In the end, I think most of this was a rant, but I'm looking for help of some kind too.  Of what kind, I'm unsure... just that I recognize that I'm incapable of finding my own path out from where I've put myself in my life.  Perhaps if anyone could offer some insight on how to make sense of what I'm feeling, and how to let my rational mind take back over and deal with how my life has backed up.

Thanks for reading this, if you've gotten this far.  I don't necessarily expect or require much in the way of feedback, especially for something this lengthy, but it would be greatly appreciated nonetheless.

endhs,depression,LecharSmells,"Need to tell someone what's going on, I have no friends I can tell.","Hi all. 
I understand that there are others that need more help than me right now, but I just needed to tell someone what is going on. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about my current situation for some time, since everyone I know is too close to the situation.

I'm 25 years old, and I have had severe depression in the past (about 7 years ago). I have been treated for it with antidepressants and therapy. I managed to wean myself off of the medicine after 2 years from the initial diagnosis, have been somewhat stable since then. Getting more stable every year. Except this year. I had been in a relationship with the love of my life and best friend for about 6 years now.

About two months ago, a couple days after my birthday, he told me that he wanted to be ""just friends"", out of nowhere. I refused because he made up some BS answer that didn't make sense to me, especially after everything we've been through together and knowing that we had an awesome relationship.  A week later, I find out through an IM convo that he had cheated on me on my birthday (I had been studying for an exam) with one of my very good friends. I couldn't believe it. They spent my entire birthday weekend together with each other, greeting me the day after my birthday with trite belated happy bday messages on facebook. When I had confronted him about it, he apologized and said that he had changed his mind and that he wanted to stay with me. I found out recently that he had cheated w/my friend again, a couple of days after he had told me he wanted to stay with me. He kept changing his mind. But for some effing reason, I still love him and am willing to forgive and work through all this crap. 
After Halloween, he made it seem like everything with us was going to work out. He would call me and text me and be intimate with me, like nothing even happened. We had several talks, but he would always clam up. He started to change his mind again, saying that he wants me to be happy and that he's going through alot of stress and is confused about everything. The limbo of whether or not he wanted to stay with me went on for the past two months, and is continuing to go on, unfortunately.
I found out that when he was making nice with me, being intimate with me, he was still seeing her on the side, and even brought her home to his family for Thanksgiving. And he's still seeing her, while lying to me about it. I've confronted him about it and called him out on his stupid lying, it's so obvious. I told him that I needed to know his final decision soon because I can't take much more of this. I tried to get my stuff out of his apartment, but he stopped me and said that he doesn't want me to take my stuff. He says that when he sees things like my hair ties/dvds/books/clothes/etc that he thinks about me and misses me....  what am I supposed to think now? Augh.

Throughout this entire ordeal, I have started to feel myself slipping again. I don't want to go back to the hospital. I don't want to be back on medicine. But I can feel it. It's so familiar and there is a part of me that wants to just let the feeling wash over me. I've started thinking about suicide again frequently, sometimes fixating on it without knowing that I'd spent hours just thinking about it. I don't want to go back to the hospital.

I want to be with my boyfriend, and I want him to choose me. I told him I was willing to fight for our relationship, we've had our ups and downs, and he's had to put up with me and the moodswings and character changes that came with getting off my meds. He was very supportive and I don't think anyone else would have been there for me like he was. I know we have something special, and I don't want to just let something this great go because I know we can work through it, but I don't know how much longer i can fight. I'm getting mentally weaker by the minute. The pain is much worse than it was 7 years ago, and I have no one to talk to because all of my ""friends"" are his friends, and he doesn't want everyone to get involved. I don't know. This probably sounds like a stupid and petty problem, I'm sorry. I just have no one to talk to and the itch for physical pain is starting to creep up on me again and I don't know what to do. I have a feeling that he is not going to choose me. I want him to, but I don't think he will. He doesn't even want to hold my hand anymore. When he tells me, will I be strong enough to handle it? I'm barely strong enough to handle anything right now.

I'm so stupid.

I'm sorry if this isn't a huge deal, I know that there are others that really need help. I just needed to tell someone, anyone.

I was going to counseling but they don't even help. I told my psychologist that I had a real difficulty speaking with my instructors and I told her that I needed to speak with them and discuss what was going on. Ughh, I am so upset and feel like she didn't take me serious enough. She brushed me off on my way and told me to speak to them since I had too.
I don't understand why my university has this center if they can't actually help you with your needs and only tell you to do what you already know you have to do (but can't do). 

I don't even ever want to come back to this place because of everything. I feel so pathetic. I had a 3.7 GPA and now I am going to be on probation next semester. I loosing my scholarship and am totally fucked. 

How did I let this happen? How do I make sure it doesn't happen again? How do I push this out of my mind long enough that I can just finish my last paper? Help:( please",8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/engjd/someone_please_help_me/,1292602341
enhuv,depression,_false_,drugs stopped working (?!?) ,"I am on 522mg bupropion, 50mg zoloft, 2.5mg zyprexa, and sometimes the occasional xanax.  This has been my course of treatment for 3 months and 15 days.  9 days ago, when the zoloft was added, suddenly it started to work - it was like the lights came on.  At the same time, I got some extremely good news (possible job offer, chance to climb out of this hole, define myself) and I was walking on air for about a week.  Then, 2 days ago, it turned out that the job offer was not going to be coming and suddenly I'm back in the pit.  I have had suicidal depression for my entire life. This is the first time I've tried medication rather than just liquor and obsessive behaviors as distractions (school, hobbies, people, volunteering, music, anything that would entertain me).

3 days ago, I met with my dr., and told him things were awesome.  I wanted to point to the zoloft and say now the puzzle was complete. 

It would appear, though, that the drugs still have not managed to do anything for me except curb my appetite and give me ringing in my right ear in the early morning and late at night.

I don't know what to do.  I can try to talk to the dr but he doesn't give a shit.  He actually forgot one of the drugs he put me on, apologized and said he had made an incorrect note in my file, and then didn't believe me when i told him the dosage.  We had to call the RX together.  He's a douche.

I have not had any alcohol in 2 months and it is driving me out of my fucking mind.  

Married, good job, loving family.  Gun to my head.  I don't understand anything.  Thank you for listening.

enmho,depression,[deleted],This is mostly a rant,"I am so tired of everything and nothing going my way.  Sure, I've fucked academically up quite a bit the past couple months, but it seems every time I sit down to try to fix it, I can't bring myself to.  Here I am on crunch day if there ever were one, and I can't bring myself to work.  Luckily, I'm also not crying (unlike yesterday when I woke up at 9pm after 18 hours of continuous sleep).

I can't focus at all and the past couple weeks this strange, powerful longing to die (or maybe ""not exist"" would be more accurate) has bloomed in my bosom.  I hate myself increasingly and can't remember the last time I felt a positive emotion aside from distraction.  I feel guilty for failing my professors and parents and for hating my life.

When I stop and think, I have no desire to get out of bed in the morning. At all.  Hope has always seemed foolish and absurd, and there's nothing I really care about.  This paragraph structure is terrible...

I'm tired of feeling this way.  I'm tired of looking to the future and seeing nothing but emptiness and misery.  I'm tired of hating every aspect of myself irrationally.  I don't actively want to die, but if I went to sleep and never woke up, I would be ok with that.  Maybe I'm just crazy in thinking that only a self-generated reason to live makes life worth living (and I'm, currently at least, either unable or unwilling to change that).",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/enmho/this_is_mostly_a_rant/,1292623094

for two years.

All my education was in 'boys only' schools. Bachelors degree too. I did go to europe for the masters course but since I'm in engineering there were no girls in my

I am now 29 years old and have never been on a date. I don't even know what its like to talk to a girl. Tried going on OKcupid and a couple of bars, shot down

enn04,depression,jmuzz,Read about my biggest regret and then tell me I'm not a monster if you can.,"Cause it would mean a ton if I could hear that from somebody, I have been hung up on this for more than a year now and have felt completely unable to move my life forward since this happened, like everything has been fake and pointless and I ruined my life and I no longer deserve to be happy so what is the point of trying...

So I'm gay, not that there's anything wrong with that.  Last year I started seeing a guy during the summer.  We hung out once a week...  We talked about staying friends, had a bunch of sex...  But near the end of it I was developing feelings for him.  And then, just before he had to leave to go to school again he told me he loved me.  I really fell for him, and I said I would do a long term relationship with him and committed to doing visits every few months (6-8 hour car drive, shouldn't have been too bad.)  He would be back home where we could hang out regularly every summer until he was done school...  Oh the life I could have had...

2 months later.  My first time visiting him.  It was my birthday.  I dunno WTF I was thinking, I guess I was stressed out from not enough sleep or having some kind of paranoia or something, but I decided while I was there that the long distance thing wasn't working for me and I wasn't getting what I needed out of the relationship and I broke up with him.  But damned if that wasn't the stupidest shit I've ever done.  I returned home.  Felt good about it.  Felt bad about it.  Regretted it.  Regrets got worse and worse.  Asked him to take me back.  He refused (probably rightly feeling I wasn't stable enough.)  We hung out again as he wanted a place to stay for a conference.  I felt disrespected by some of his actions, tried to talk to him about it via Email later, erupted in a fight, he said he totally misjudged me as a person and said a bunch of other shit, and since them my self worth has been under -9000 and my guilt level over +.

Here's the kicker, I was 26 at the time, and he was 19.  So yeah, isn't this some kind of terrible manipulative thing that I did?  Don't I deserve to be miserable and keep on punishing myself by sabotaging the good things in my life and refusing to find any joy in them?

enn9e,depression,needsomehelpnow,Need Advice about Depressed Mother,"Throwaway account...

Hey reddit, I'm a longtime lurker, and I rarely post anything but I feel as if some people in this community might have some good advice. So here goes...

Over the last few months my mother has spiraled into a somewhat deep depression that, frankly, I have no idea how to deal with at this point. I'm scared, I'm angry, and most of all, feeling very helpless, and am looking for any suggestions as to how I can help my mother over come this terrible mental health issue.

I believe that this all started about 7-8 years ago, when my parents finally decided to get a divorce. Around this time, my mother was fairly taken back by the death of both her grandmother and mother, and was severely distraught. She seemed to cope with this fairly well over the next little while, but the subsequent divorce (in my opinion) started off a series of events that led to her current depression. Her and I (I was 15 at the time) stayed in our family home, while my dad moved a couple of km away. She barely acknowledged him for the next couple of years, almost to the point of ignoring his existence. Meanwhile, he was (and still is) very close to me, and was helping her out financially after the divorce. My dad is a great man who I admire dearly, and has been trying to help her any way he can since the separation.

My mother began to be a very big hoarder, and eventually our house filled up with copious amounts of useless junk. I tried staying on top of this, but as a teenager, didn't have much of an impact.

This went on for the last 7 years - she was working very little (part time), had no real hobbies and social life on a daily basis (although she still managed to find things to occupy her). Her life was OK, but looking back everything was in limbo - i recognized that she was not dealing with any outstanding emotional issues, and as a very stubborn person by nature, it was hard to get anything out of her. I stayed at home during my undergrad, partially because I didn't want to leave her alone in such a relatively big house (she needed someone to do all the heavy lifting, grocery shopping, etc...). 

Fast forward to this summer - I finished my undergrad, got accepted to Grad school a few hours away from home, and decided that I was finally going to move away (I'm 23 now). At around this time, my mother began to show a change of heart, and said that she wanted to sell the house (it was getting older and needed some work that we had not enough money for, and too much space for 1 person to live in.) I was happy that she decided to do this, so over the next couple of months, spent A LOT of time cleaning out all the junk that she had accrued over the last decade (quite the task I must say). By end of summer we managed to sell the house, buy her a really nice and affordable condo about 15 minutes away from the previous locations, and clean out all of her crap. I also moved away around this time, but have visited her almost every weekend since then.

During the move, she began to really worry me - she lost a lot of weight (she is skinny to begin with), stated being very negative and indecisive, and her self esteem went down. I hoped that this was all going to end when she finally moved in to her new condo and settled in, but I was wrong... It got to the point where we went to multiple doctors and psychiatrists looking for some solution to her state of mind, and on multiple accounts was told that she needs to take medication (anti-depressants and anti-anxiety) in order to cope with this problem. She's very cynical of any type of medication, and it was almost impossible to talk her into taking the anti-depressents. She's been attending weekly meetings with her psychiatrist, and says she is taking her medication (but refuses to take the anti anxiety meds), but after 3 months of this we have seen no positive change, but rather a continued increase in depression. My father has been talking to her a lot, as well as friends and myself, but without much success.

She's alone in this condo, and every day I keep feeling more and more scared. Very recently she has made some concerning statements: she say's that she is losing any drive to live, and had called me last week to say goodbye to me. I feared the worst, but then she explained that she wanted to be admitted to the hospital and feared the doctors would ""dope her up"" [sic] so much that this was the last time I was ever going to see her normal. My dad agreed to take her to the hospital, but again she refused. 

She's losing touch with reality, and her being unsupervised is not comforting to me. My dad has been trying to help any way he can, but this seems to do more harm then good. At this point, she keeps fixating on my father, saying that she wants to get back together and have a ""proper family"" as she always wanted. Meanwhile, my dad has his own life now, and this will never happen (they just dont work together). I'm coming home for the holidays, but It's really hard for me to spend time with her without yelling or feeling upset, largely because nothing I try seems to be working.

 I don't know what else to do - should I admit her to a facility (which she will not be happy with), or take time off school and try and help her by being close to her (this is temporary, as I have to finish school sooner or later)? How do i get her to take the anti-anxiety meds?

Any suggestions from redditors in similar circumstances? How did you cope with this? What seemed to work best?

TL;DR: My mother is depressed, and therapy + medicine is not working after 3 months. Her condition is worsening, and there are hints of suicide in her thoughts at this point. What can i do to help?

He said that, he was going to have to let me go, that I wasn't being nice enough to the waitresses, and that talking about smoking weed was unacceptable.

eny6u,depression,Notmyrealhandle25,People wonder why I never seem to think it will get better. Why am always so damn pessimistic. Let me tell you a tale.,"My life kind of sucks.  I'm a 25 year old male living with his 64 year old mother, working a part time job making about 600 dollars a month.  There's other problems too. Like how it seems to be impossible to get out of the worthless job I have and get into something that will earn me enough to do CRAZY things like get my own place, pay for my own needs and stop being a lonely 16 year old stuck in my 25 year old body.

I know someone that has worked for Coca-Cola's distribution arm for about 10 years now.  He said he could help me out. Get me a job there. That would be amazing, seeing as how even the entry level job there makes about 14/hour. Not to mention all the over time.

Got an interview. Took them a week to send me an e-mail telling me I wasn't good enough to put boxes of soda on a pallet.

Tried again. Applied for both the warehouse job as well as the merchandising job. Only got called for an interview for Merchandising (this is where you drive around to all the grocery stores and stock their shelves for them and set up displays). Awesome! That's 15.50. I'm more qualified for this job too! I have 10 years of almost unbroken customer service experience and they want someone that is good with customers and people. I'm totally in.

Took them less than 24 hours to tell me I wasn't good enough to stock soda.

I tried again. 3+months later they had another listing for a warehouse job. I never got a call for an interview for that one.  If any other jobs get listed, I've learned not to apply for them, since I'm obviously not good enough to work for them.

About a month ago, maybe 5-6 weeks at the most, a friend of mine out of the blue IM's me. Asks for my resume. He went to bat for me with HIS friend who works for a rural ISP talking me up, asking her to back me to get into this place.  They have an opening for an entry level IT tech. Awesome! That's, literally, exactly what I'm looking for.  I make arrangements to stay at somebody's place near by so I can commute there if I get the job. Arrange for someone to work for me if I have to call off to go for an interview short notice.
I end up communicating with friend's contact that works there. She's totally cool. We get along great.
2 weeks go by. She IM's me one day to tell me she had to almost threaten them to get them to take my resume out of the trash. I should have realized how poorly this boded for me.
Finally, they call me...at 2pm on Tuesday. I never hear the phone ring. Why? Because I work thirds. I'm dead asleep at 2pm. Leave a message. Don't really sound that enthused. I don't get this until I wake up at 10pm that night to go to work. Well, can't very well call them back that late, so whatever. Go to work. Work my shit, 8-hour shift making almost nothing, get home totally exhausted and worn out. Grab something to eat, take a shower and go to bed. Figure I'll call them before the week's up.
They call again. Thursday this time. AT FUCKING 3:30PM! Didn't leave a message. When was I supposed to get this call? They KNOW I work thirds. The contact there TOLD them.
Funny enough, I happened to be awake. I call them right back. Get the secretary. Tell her who I'm calling for and who I am. She transfers me. Phone rings, and goes to voicemail. I leave an exuberant 5minute-ish long message. Talking about how eager and excited I am. How I can't wait to talk to him and see him for an interview. Etc.
I stayed up another 3 hours waiting for a call back that never came.
I don't hear anything until last night, before work. My friend IM's me. He's pissed and disappointed. He's never going to help me again. Says I've obviously interested in working retail my entire life, since *I NEVER CALLED THEM BACK*
Wait. What?
Evidently, the guy I called told at least my contact there that he would never hire me now, and he's super annoyed and I'll never get a job there because I *NEVER CALLED HIM BACK*
I realize, as I've stewed on this whole thing that I was never going to get a job there. They were never going to hire me. I was never supposed to get any of those phone calls. You don't call and talk to someone that works thirds at 3pm.
The biggest thing that pisses me off, even more than not getting a shot at this job, is my friend has now given up on me, since I've obviously screwed everything up and my new friend that works there things I've lied and made her look bad.
It's been a bad 12 hours since I found out about this. I'm filled with bitterness and selfhate and depressed as shit. I needed to tell *someone.*
And that, ladies and gents, is why my life is shit.",7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eny6u/people_wonder_why_i_never_seem_to_think_it_will/,1292690145
enylk,depression,ThrowAwayOrNot,Time to give back some help.,"Hello /r/depression,

Warning, long and first post, but worth it I believe.

EDIT : Here's a TL, DR; :

1) Identify what is it you have

2) Acceptance of your state of mind and thoughts

3) Find the right SSRIs

4) Find the right therapist

5) Go on with usual advices ( Eat properly, do sports, get out of apartment, see people, talk to friends, drink less etc)  

6) Don't read too much STORIES of depressions, don't read too much people bragging about their happiness either

7) Profit 



(probable throw away account, given this thread and those I plan to make for /r/BDSM :) )
 
I'm on my way to recovery, and I'd like to share what I think are the basics of overcoming a depression. I read lots of good advices here and elsewhere, and I think it's fair to give back now that I'm better. Obvious and mandatory statement : I'm not a doctor, this is just my take on the problem, from my experience and other's experiences.

I'm not going to detail my story, unless you're interested, for reasons I'll detail below. Also, english is not my first language, apologies for typos and such.

1) Identification
The first, most important thing, is to realize if you have or not a depression. It may sound simple, but some people have other issues - such as insomnia, anxiety - which may be depression symptoms but might as well be a complete separate issue, which won't be solved the same way. Also, if you're a teenager, remember it's very common to feel depressed and dark at this age. It's temporary, it doesn't mean your condition is not real or that you exaggerate it, but the good news is you can be fine by just waiting it out ( in general, and if you *can*), which is not the case about most depressions.

Now, the steps to recovery : You'll find many resources about depression that give (very good) advices, such as doing sport, simply walk out of your house, try to force yourself into meeting people, eat well -very well actually-, talk to friends and family, get a hobby, go to /r/getting_over_it, listen to new music.

All of these are good advices, and you should do them at one point, now if you can. But the problem is you're probably too depressed to actually do any of it.
Or see any point to it. That's depression for you : you just can't cope with yourself, your issues.

2) Acceptance
First step to overcome this is, is acceptance : Depression is quite common, and happens to a large variety of people. You're not weak, bad, whatever, it's just happened to you, like cancer may happen to people : there are causes, and sometimes it just happens out of the blue. It may be bad luck or any other reasons, but don't dwell on the causes too much for now.
You must accept your depression, accept your bad thoughts and state of mind. Don't try to reject them, they'll come back stronger. The basic thought mechanism is ""ok, it sucks immensely, this is clear, but this is normal.This is ok. I'll deal with it. Bad thought number1 : you're here, I acknowledge you, you're part of me. I'll sort you out."" .Then try to *gently* push the thought away, don't repress it strongly.
My first, natural reaction was to try to strongly reject the bad thoughts, but that's not helping at all. This is something therapy taught me and I can confirm it's true : It's making you more obsessional, drives you crazy, till the ""I want to die"" thought becomes overwhelming.
So learn to truly accept your depression, and in mind THIS IS SOLVABLE, you're not the first or the last one to be in this horrible shitty state of mind and you won't be the first or the last one to overcome it. Of course you don't believe me or yourself for now ( I wouldn't have as little as 4 months ago), this is ok too , just consider you have absolutely nothing to lose in trying this, except maybe money, but money worth shit compared to your well being so spend it there / earn more to get through, it worth it.

Now, I advocate the combination antidepressants (SSRIs) + therapy. 

3) Find the right SSRIs
You might have read a lot of shit about AD, and maybe it scares you. I'd just say that : I thought it would be the worst thing to do to myself, but they basically saved my life. 
The important part is to find the right one for you. If you don't feel less ""dark"", if you don't have less bad thoughts after a month after a month of treatment, or if the side effects are too bad, you MUST change brand. 
Many doctors have no clues about AD and give them away and basically let you deal with it. You must find the right one, don't hesitate to change (especially if side effects are worse than the depression, which is something that may happen) brand or doctor even if you feel uncomfortable with them.
The right AD don't make you feel ""empty"" or zombified. They don't make you happy either, it's a misconception. They just make you have less bad thoughts, and make you able to deal with them (you become less obsessional / anxious about them, which in turns make them less strong). 
This will make therapy much, much more efficient for you. It will give you a break, and make you able to deal with your issues.

4) Find the right therapist
Now, there are many therapists, like there are many AD. Analytical, behavioral, mix of two, and GOOD AND BAD therapists. I've been blessed by finding a good one at my first shot, but this hasn't been the case for other peopleI know. Remember therapist may suck at their job, like any other employee in any specialty.
So same thing as for AD, be prepared to change (the sucky thing is that you have to give it a go for a month approximately, don't switch too early). 

5) Go on with ""classic"" advices
With this, you should be much more prepared to go through the other advices ( sport, eat well etc, ref. point 1), and continue your recovery process.

6) Don't read too much STORIES of depressions, don't read too much people bragging about their happiness either

Another thing I find useful, is to not read too much stories about depression. It might be obvious, but yeah this makes you feel more depressed even if you're first comforted by the fact you're not alone experiencing shit in your life. That's why I won't detail my story in this post.
At the opposite of the scale, don't read too much bragging / I'm super happy threads or articles either, for a similar reason. It may make you jealous, sad , envious, more obsessional.
Just read the recovery / solutions bits if you can, and don't read the story or don't pay attention to it.

Last but not least, if you have grown in a religious environment, you're facing an extremely hard challenge in addition, whether you're still a believer or not . I feel too lazy to detail it now but you can google it (religious envrionment / depression).

7) Profit
I hope I helped. I'm still not a great state of mind as I speak, but all those advices made me get over the darkest, most hopeless, period of my life. The ""badness"" I feel now is ok and will be dealt with in time, I'm just happy I got out of the ""no hopes and plenty of obsessional bad thoughts"" phase. It's getting better and better, and I now I'll be well at one point.",10,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/enylk/time_to_give_back_some_help/,1292692041
enze8,depression,_throwaway325_,Need advice for someone married to a person with depression.,"So I really need advice.  I've read a bunch of depression websites, talked to some people, but I'm at my wits end and I don't know what to do anymore.


So, here's the story.  I'm married to a woman with depression (self-diagnosed, but has been prescribed different medications for it from the family doctor).  We've been together 5 years and have a child.  In the past she has gone in and out of funks, but on the whole has been pretty stable.  In the last 6 months things have gone from semi-bad to really bad.  She has told me that she is having a hard time being in a committed relationship, that she loves me but isn't in love with me, that she has doubts about what she wants, that it is not my fault, etc.  I've told her that I will stay with her no matter what it takes, but I'm really having a hard time with this.


Lately she has been treating her friends better than she has me.  She would rather go out and party it up like a single lady rather than spend any time with me.  She says she loves me, but I don't receive any physical or emotional affection from her at all.  It feels to me like I'm slowly being replaced and that my feelings mean very little to her.

I've been with a girl for a few years, and her life isn't really sunshine and rainbows. I've tried really hard to keep her life afloat, and it's come at a large cost to my own; I've suffered in the health departments as well as academically, and I don't really have a social life left either. Social life problems include: my family is seriously sick of my shit and wants me to break up with her already, and thinks I'm retarded for staying. I rarely see my friends at this point, I miss them to death and I feel so terrible every time there's a gathering and I'm not there. I should be graduating college soon, with subpar grades; at this point I just want the diploma and to go out into the working world somehow, but I don't even know if I can land a job or if I'm healthy enough to hold one. The part that bothers me the most is probably that I shouldn't be in this situation at all; I've made it through a terrible illness, I was a great student, but somehow I got myself here.


My girlfriend is likely depressed herself; academically she isn't doing too well, but she needs to get a job as soon as possible. She lives in an oppressive home environment that makes her nonfunctional, so getting her out of her home is her current priority, but she needs money to stabilize that and make it possible.


I'm supposed to go on a trip with said friends tomorrow. I want to go. I feel like if I suddenly go though, I haven't been spending enough time with family so I feel bad about that, and I'd be leaving the girlfriend behind for the span of a few days. I can't see that going over well, but at the same time I don't feel like it's an unreasonable demand. I spent a lot of time with this girl, mainly at this point to help keep her out of the house. Arguably she could go out by herself or with friends, but she doesn't want to go out alone (is my understanding at least, if its something different that's possible but unlikely) and she doesn't have any friends to go out with at this point. I'm torn between what I do; if I stay it feels like enabling and it comes at more cost to me, if I go it feels like abandonment and causes more problems. Another note though is that trying to deal with short term problems all the time may just allow a long term problem to continue festering. Mom is pissed at me about this whole ordeal, freshly so right now, I haven't even mentioned trip to girlfriend, friends have wanted to go forever and its been on the calendar for ages. I have schoolwork to makeup as well...

One of the primary reasons I quit my job was due to the fact I have anxiety, and was having constant panic attacks the last weeks I was there.
My main problem now is that I fear of being unsuccessful. I see my friends around my age, getting great jobs, moving into their own houses, and it frightens me that I might not see that for a while. I get ideas of ways to make a living, but lose motivation for them quickly. I'll start a project, or a website, or an idea, and within a week I find myself bored of it, or just lose motivation, despite getting profits or not. This is an extremely frustrating predicament.
I find it hard to do something that I enjoy, and any hobbies i've tried before I lose motivation to keep them going. I've thought long and hard about something I could enjoy, and turn a profit.

eo6wx,depression,depressed_girl,In a relationship and depression deepening no matter what.,"Background: diagnosed with depression, bipolar, etc, etc...

I hate being on meds because they make me feel numb, without energy and they stunt my personality.

I'm in a relationship and it's been a year in. I've been depressed about 70% of the way through. Gradually, as time goes on my boyfriend has been less interested in initiating sex with me (and I'm always up for it) and has shown less interest in me in general. If we go out to see his friends he'll leave me in a corner fully knowing that I don't know any one and feel hugely uncomfortable and anxious, so lately I've just been leaving these situations all together.

If I'm down I'll let him know but these days he ignores me. I feel like I'm crying with my arms open begging ""please comfort me, I need your love now more than anything to get me over this hump"" but he ignores me... he won't even return my calls. He'll come home later (we live together) and warily pretend as though everything is okay. I feel so alone and scared sometimes and I used to have him to talk to and now I have no one.

I'm doing CBT in my own time and have tried therapy and it helps but sometimes the feeling is so overwhelming and I need comfort and I feel as though I am just left there. I feel unloved, unwanted and insecure, basically.

I sometimes wonder if I'd be better off alone. I want to escape to another state and just start all over (who would miss me?)

I'm not suicidal and I have had blips of happiness and productivity but this cycle in the relationship gets me down hugely. The more I need him the more he withdraws... which makes me sadder which makes me need him more...

He used to make me feel so safe and loved and I thrived when I felt that way. Now I feel the opposite. Our daily interactions are barbed at best and I'm always holding my tongue, trying to stay relaxed, trying not to feel rejected when he doesn't try to fuck me and love me....

I feel so alone and useless in this relationship. What are you supposed to do when the one thing you need is the one thing you can't get? Forget about it and create another need?

We love each other so much and have invested so much time in this but I don't know anymore, it just feels like a 'relationship', not two people who are connected and loving...

eofqh,depression,[deleted],I want to die.,"I thought long and hard about writing this. It seems to me anyone who makes a post like this is blatantly crying for attention. But so what if I am? It doesn't matter anymore...

I'm bipolar, type 2. 22 years old. I can't remember a time in my life where I've been happy. I don't know what being happy means. 

Financially, I guess you could say I'm a success, especially for my age. I make pretty good money, I have a nice apartment, and on the surface what would seem like a pretty good life.

But I can't enjoy any of it. I've been to doctors, I've taken pills, I've done therapy, I've done all the crappy little things they expect to work and they never do. I try to be optimistic, but shit happens and it sends me spiraling back into deep depression. I'm sick of it.

Since I was five I knew suicide was probably the most likely outcome for my life. I've wanted to kill myself pretty much perpetually since then. I've never actually made an attempt -- I'm scared of both death and the consequences of what would happen if I failed. But it's always on my mind. Throughout everything.

I've felt worthless. Unattractive. Useless. I have no reason to be alive. I contribute nothing to society. I take up space and consume resources -- indeed, it's not just psychological masturbation to think that the world would in fact be better off if I were dead.

My family doesn't talk to me -- not that there's any animosity between us, they've just never really cared or tried to care. I have no friends. Not to say I couldn't have friends if I tried, but I have no social skills, and the constant anxiety I feel in social situations prevents me from pursuing it. The very idea of that anxiety means I don't even *want* to go out. I just sit at home day after day. I talk to no one, not even online. 

Aside from work, I am completely isolated from the outside world. If I dropped dead tomorrow, they'd just think I'd quit and there would be no inquiry into my whereabouts. I know this because I've taken entire weeks off work without telling anyone, and all I got was an email asking if I was coming in.

There's no end in sight to this dreary existence. There's no hope of getting over it. I've tried tons of pills, none of them work.

I've been through Paxil, Wellbutrin, Abilify, Lithium, Adderall, Cymbalta, and a host of others with zero effect. I am without the slightest hope of ever getting better, of ever being happy.

But when you tell some one that you want to die, their reaction is, of course, that you shouldn't. But at what point does that cease to be the case?

If you see a wounded animal, it's obviously in pain, and it will obviously never pull through -- it will simply die in agony, slowly -- wouldn't it be far better to simply put it out of its misery, than let it suffer?

And truly, I am suffering. I cannot take this pain. It's the worst feeling in the world and it's perpetual. It never ceases. There is no let up.

Even when I cycle to my ""hypomania"" phase, I don't feel any of the euphoria associated with a manic state. I get more work done, I have more energy, but am I happy? no. Do I feel better about myself? no.

I can never have children. I refuse. I will not put any child through this hellish nightmare. I broke up with my girlfriend because I couldn't bear to put her through my shit any longer. 

She couldn't understand that it wasn't HER that was making me unhappy. She couldn't understand that no matter how hard she tried to please me, I was incapable of enjoying anything. 

Food doesn't taste good. Jokes aren't funny. Sex is meh. Even hard drugs offer little in the way of comfort, and coming off them simply compounds the problem.

I want to die. I'm afraid to die. But that's all I want at this point.

**EDIT:** Wow, quite a few responses. I guess I should follow up.

I wrote this post because I was feeling particularly shitty and felt like I needed an outlet for that shittiness. I wasn't really expecting much beyond ""QQ more ya noob"" so I haven't really checked since I posted it.

First, thanks for all your responses. I tend to think the worst of people when it comes to what they think about me, so it's hard to expect much empathy from others.

One of the most annoying things about this whole process for me is that changing doctors is NOT a fun process. Everytime I have to find a new shrink I have to wait 2 months for an appointment. In this case, I made an appointment in october, and it's not until Jan 4th. Soonest I could find. 

My previous doctor treated me like a criminal the moment I admitted to having self medicated with pot (something I don't particularly recommend). I was under the impression I was supposed to be honest with my doctor, and not expect judgment.

I've brought up the possibility of ECT before, and was told we should look to drugs first. I don't really want to look to drugs first. I mean, it seems to me it's a pretty safe, effective and painless process with few side effects, so why not? Why endure all the endless side effects and weight gain that comes with the cocktail of pills they expect me to take?

I've been on so many pills I can't remember all of them. I've tried eating better, getting more exercise (I've lost 50lbs since my last birthday), getting more regulated sleep, etc. And I do feel better physically, but I'm still the same wreck I've always been emotionally. 

At this moment, I can't say I'm at the same point I was when I wrote the original post. I want to live, but it's hard knowing that at any moment something might trigger those feelings of hopelessness again. 

And my appointment is still 2 weeks away. I only have one week of medication left.

eoh3o,depression,regretandworry,I feel trapped by life,"I'm not sure what I am expecting to get out of this. I guess I hope that talking about it at least will make me feel better. Here goes..

I am depressed a lot lately. I have been in the past, and I usually get over it, but this time its lasting a long long time. Most medication doesn't work for me, or I stop taking it. I tend to outsmart my psychologists because its just in my nature to never admit anything is really wrong. The whole psychology/psychiatry thing are complex and difficult, so its way too easy to convince them of a particular problem, get your pills, and move on while saying everything is alright.

It started with elementary school, when I moved. I was on ritalin, and I was very short and malnourished as a result. I hated eating, I was obsessed with germs and such. I got picked on a lot when we moved from one elementary school to another. I lost all of my friends, and was now the new kid who was tiny and a little odd.

My oddness just increased as I became a social outcast. Without friends, I stopped understanding how to interact with people. I became obsessed with AOL and IRC and things online. Video games, books, programming, everything that wasn't interaction in a physical space with people. This went on for a long time.

When I was 20, I finally decided, 'Fuck it, I'm going to get a girl.' So I did. It worked out pretty well, lost my virginity all of two weeks later. I started getting overweight when I turned 14 and got off ritalin, but that wasn't really a problem in my quest I guess.

But then I fell in love with her, and I married her. Logically, she is perfect for me and I don't know what I would do without her. We've been together 4 years... not a spectacularly long time, but longer than I've ever kept any non-family member around me. Its just.. I'm depressed. She went to college, she had all of these experiences and I have not. She's had 7 partners, and I've had her. I'm bi, and I've never done anything with a guy either, but she's fucked a few women while she was at it.

I'm stuck in a job. We have debt like cars, student loans, living, etc,  that we need the two jobs and can't get by on just hers or just mine. I don't dislike the job, its just not quite what I want but I'm scared to look for something else.

I hang out with some of my other friends, and all they can talk about is the latest person they banged, or the party they went to while I was asleep so I could go to work in the morning.

All of these thoughts, and I feel guilty for every one. I am upset about being overweight, while feeling guilty because I know there are people who can't get enough food. I want to leave my job and start my own business, while feeling guilty because I know there are people stuck in far worse financial situations. I want to have more sexual experiences, while feeling guilty because there are 30 year old virgins (I'm 24) and people who won't find someone who loves them as much as my wife loves me.

I stay awake sometimes and just wish I could leave everything behind me, all of this baggage from past shit, and all of the baggage from my friends and my wife and my debts and just move and start a new life somewhere else all by myself and see how it goes. Logically I know this is a crazy idea, but emotionally I just feel off track and lost and sometimes I feel if I can't just reset everything I may as well just end everything.

I don't know what I want, and I feel bad for not knowing and for taking the great things I have for granted, but what I feel is what I feel and I can't seem to make the thoughts stop or go away, and I feel like theres not much anyone can do to help me. Change has to come from me, and I just don't know how to do it and I feel like I don't have the strength or time.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eoh3o/i_feel_trapped_by_life/,1292798417
eoheh,depression,rklex,I am way beyond apathetic. I've essentially muted my emotions.,"Sorry it's long winded but i'm not sure exactly how to get what's happening across.
**TL;DR: My grandmother got lunge cancer and passed. Grandfather brought in other woman, and made a spectacle in public. Never grieved. Don't know how to start to get over it and get emotions back.**


Growing up my family was tight knit around my grandmother. We lived about a mile away from her. We were always there. I remember her house better than my own. It wasn't just my parents and my two sisters, it was also my two cousins and my aunt who lived half an hour away. I remember us all being there. Everything she did was amazing. She cooked, she made us costumes for school plays. She decorated not only the house, but the outside, like for halloween she would put carved pumpkins all up and down the drive way. The neighbors even let her use their large side yard to put up more lights and such. Everything felt like home when she did it. She supported us (being the 5 grandchildren) in everything we did. She took us to soccer practice, walked us to school, did whatever was needed to help. Then when I was in 4th grade she was diagnosed with lunge cancer. We watched her go from a lively active woman, to sick and tired. It was the worst when it spread to her brain and changed her. Then shortly after, she passed. I was maybe ten when she passed. 
The situation got worse. At the time I didn't think anything could make life worse than my grandmother dying, but my grandfather found a way to do it. He moved another women into my grandmothers house not 2 months after it happened. We were still trying to sort my grandmothers things. This woman he brought in told us that she was going to throw it all out and if she found us at the house again she was going to call the cops. Things were tense not only at home, but also in public. All of the grandchildren played soccer, and scenes happened at the local soccer league between my father and grandfather that turned into shouting and us leaving early. Many hateful things were said. Everything was a complete wreck. I didn't know how to go to my family about it. The one memory I have about crying for my grandmother after the funeral is of us in the house that my grandmother grew up in. It was late at night, I couldn't sleep as it was the first time we had gone back there. I started crying and my sister said as in how I remember it, ""Crying isn't going to bring her back."" Knowing my sister, that isn't something she would tell me but that's how it stuck. So there I was, lost without the center of my life, not knowing how to deal with, thinking that I shouldn't cry about it. I made it through school ok, never doing great nor terrible, just doing what I feasibly thought was reasonable from the teachers. I moved through highschool doing well in what I thought was interesting but didn't need much work. My work ethic diminished, in most aspects. I had been a soccer fanatic and the star of any team I played with. Not too much later that stopped, I played well and on competitive teams, but never stuck out or really progressed. I never finished games, I would get to the end of them and just stop. When it came time to decide what to do for higher education I picked something easy because I had no interest in anything. I still really don't. The things that really trouble me are
1) I can't find a way to not half ass anything, esp school work. I wait till last second, or don't do it at all. Growing up I was a come home from school do it then kinda kid.
2) I can't say I've grown attached to more than handful of people. Nor can I say I've remotely cared for any girl I've dated. It's always been more of a companion thing. I never use them physically, I've found that since I noticed I don't care I've becoming incredibly timid with women. I always let them lead because if I don't I really do feel like I'm using them.
3) I feel like I haven't grieved for my grandmother. I can't so much think about her without crying. It's been long and hard getting through this.
4) I don't seem to feel much of anything. My second room mate in college told me that he couldn't read how I was feeling about anything until I was pushed to far and went to anger (which rarely happens).

I talked for a few sessions to a psychiatrist in training or so, a woman finishing her doctorate at my school. She picked up on most of my things, such as the not caring for my gf. I all of this with her. She told me that she thinks I have a mild reoccurring depression and muted emotions, but I can't remember the name of it. The semester ended, she was graduating, and I was moving back home. The sessions stopped and I went back on with normal life, going through with just work and playing ultimate ignoring my blankness once again. 

**How would I go about getting over this. I now live over seas going to school, and won't as much see my family for another 7 months. So I find it very hard talking to them about it. What are things I can start to do to help with this and get life back in me?** I know I always hear everyone grieves differently, but I just don't know how I do. It's starting to get me way down again, and I want to take care of it before I get over it for the time being and ignore it again.

eoi1p,depression,MsBitch,Eating myself up over daughter being abused,"I am suffering from PND, and out of nowhere, I started thinking about something that happenned years ago when my eldest two children were babies. I was a single parent, I had come out of an extremely violent relationship and was in pieces. I used to attend a young mothers group, and there was a girl there who kept offering to babysit my kids overnight.

It seems ludicrous to me now that I ever took her up on her offer, I hardly knew her except from the group, I had never visited her home or she mine, I didn't even like her that much. I let her have my kids overnight because I was so desperate for some rest and sleep. When I collected my kids the next morning (they were aged 20 months and 8 months) my eldest was crying and the stupid woman told me she had not stopped crying since I had left. I don't remember how I felt, I remember her sitting on the floor sobbing, and I took them home.

It never occured to me at the time that something bad may have happenned to them. I was broken, depressed and young and stupid. Since the idea that they may have been hurt has entered my mind I cannot shake it. I mull it over again and again as to why this girl, who had 2 small children of her own and was pregnant, would be so insistent on taking my kids overnight, I always reach the same conclusion, either she or someone (her OH?) around her wanted to hurt them.

My eldest has had serious bowel issues, she never went to the toilet properley and still does not. I cannot help thinking they did something so bad to her it caused this. The thought of them hurting her makes me physically vomit, the guilt eats me up, I cannot believe I left my children with a virtual stranger. I cannot believe how selfish and stupid I was.

The worst part is not really knowing, but I honestly cannot think of one good reason why that girl would have wanted to take my kids. She was only 17 (I was 20). 
I don't know how to stop thinking about it, because there is no way of really knowing, and no possible resolution, I don't know how to move on from it. ",4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eoi1p/eating_myself_up_over_daughter_being_abused/,1292802588
eoio6,depression,guidancewouldbegood,Premed student struggling with life. Might as well write it all down first. ,"""It's just..."".

That is indeed the phrase I have dreaded for the past four months. What exact is the remainder of such a phrase?

I've been working my ass off for four months now, in one of the most prestigious and highly competitive universities in my country. I don't find the workload excessive, and I walk into exams feeling prepared, but the grades haven't been good. And despite being able to talk to my girlfriend and my sibling about how the results are not coming in, and how despite my best efforts, I'm keeping a brave face about it, I will always have that ""It's just..."" somewhere along the lines within the conversation.

I get my work done, it's for sure. And I've worked harder since the midterms to get everything back on track. But in doing so, I've just been getting more and more depressed. And the finals didn't feel great to walk out of, despite my all.

This year, many of my friends didn't come back, unable to pass required courses; many friends have dropped out around exam time, unable to cope with the stresses; I have no friends nearby. I have such a lack of friends, in fact, that I've taken to ordering in food for myself, going out to eat by myself, even going out to bars and drinking by myself. The bars part, of course, did not start until very recently, because I have had a fear of my depression worsening during the period of alcohol. 

Yes, I have a family history of mental illness. And yes, I have sought out help at my University's mental heath centre, but their scheduling spots begin in January. I don't think I'll be able to wait until then.

I want to make it as a doctor, I want to get into medical school and all I want to do is work to be able to make it in. The one thing I want the most, more than anything else, is to help and cure people, and use the benefits of my acquired knowledge to do good in the world. I am a well-rounded person who has done considerable volunteer work and research work, who enjoys exercise and his long-distance relationship. I eat good food, I exercise regularly, I have a great family, and I have a lot of potential.

But that's ""just it"", isn't it? I feel like a waste of potential, whose best attempts to succeed will only be met with failure. I have thrown everything I have into the fire, so to speak, reread WebCT, gone through all the annotations several times, done my readings, and attempted to rid myself of all distractions. But I am doomed to not meet the objectives I have set for myself. Losers do not get into Medical School. Dreamers do not get into Medical School. 

I have sought ways to cope with the depression and anxiety, of course. Exercise, the aforementioned help, timed distractions every now and again (reading, Reddit, news, webcomics, Rubik's Cubes, Sudoku, you name it). But I find little solace in these things, and I find myself hating all the things I used to love considerably much. I feel as though Drugs won't help, either.

For years, I have gotten to where I am by manning up, getting over things, and completing tasks to the best of my abilities. But it all just feels empty right now, and I'm unsure how to get out of it.

It also seems that I can't seem to communicate properly lately... in my head I said x, y and z, but later on I reread my email, or go over the conversation in my head and realize that I left a bunch of important detail out, or just completely missed the point I was trying to make.

Additionally, I can't seem to get up the motivation to do hardly anything.  I used to be such a hard worker, but lately I've been doing the bare minimum, at work and in my personal life.

Anyway, some background: I'm overweight and have been my entire life.  As I'm getting older I'd really like to lose some weight.  Been counting calories for the past two weeks... too many carbs... so at least I know what I should do for that.  I also moved to this city about two years ago and I still don't have any close friends here.  My best friends live eight hours away.

This all seemed to have started for me about the time my wife and I got out of debt.  It was a lot of hard work and took years, but we did it and now we are quite financially secure.

eovd9,depression,issheinterested,"When dating someone w/ depression, how do you know when..","...they're either disinterested or simply need space?

I've been dating my girlfriend for ~8 months now and of course things always seem to be a little more exciting at the beginning, so I don't want to unfairly compare everything to that. But for the past couple of months or so, she's been a bit more honest about her anxiety and depression, but I can't help but think that the flat tone in her text messages/being okay with not seeing me for weeks means she's disinterested.

Now clearly there are times that those who are depressed need their space, but say that she was over me, how in the world would I know if I wouldn't know whether or not to chalk up her distance to depression or disinterest? She's really nice so I don't even know if she'd blatantly tell me to eff off out of sheer guilt...but I'd prefer that if that's how she felt.

I've read that at times those who are depressed simply need time by themselves and tend to push those away who they care for (she's admitted this herself), and not necessarily because they don't like them. Obviously there have to be times when they are pushing someone away that they would prefer to not be with, too.

ep85m,depression,tatertotty,"How to detach from parents? At the very least, how to cope?","Hey lovely reddit. First time in this subreddit, though the reddit community in general has helped me through some tough times. I apologize in advance for ranting rambling babbling, but I desperately need help coping with the parents. The history might take a bit long to outline so let's get started.

My parents and I have always had a very rough relationship. Both are very well educated and live very disciplined, strict lifestyles. Ever since I was young, I always felt like they were making me grow up way faster than I should've been. Even silly silly things that only make sense in retrospect: being disciplined for having a baby blanket, ridiculed (and I mean serious ridicule) whenever I did/said something childish, and (I say this bitterly but with some embarrassment) throwing away any stuffed animals or toys when they felt I was becoming too dependent. Anyway, childhood stuff aside, this is the kind of attitude they raised me with. I was constantly put into academic programs that were 3+ years over my class level, not because of talent or intelligence but just because they decided I'd ""be able to handle it."" I started fantasizing about suicide when I was still fairly young, around 8-10 (I know this because of the dates on some drawings and some things I'd written), but never seriously attempted suicide.

In my early pre-teens I also had to abide by a strict curfew so I'd only ever have contact with friends Saturday afternoon (this curfew was generously extended to 7pm Saturdays by the time I entered high school). Unfortunately for them, I also lost my virginity quite young. To avoid a tangent about that, let's just say I kept my mouth shut about it (it was my idea, completely consensual), but my best friend snooped in my diary and turned me into the school parent teacher association and my parents found out pretty quickly. I was basically told to my face that I was no better than a prostitute, that I had shamed the family, that I didn't deserve my last name, bla bla bla. This confrontation was a long and drawn out one, but the message was always the same. My father then decided he would not speak to me for the next two years though we lived in the same house (I was grounded in my room for a few months and not allowed to leave the room unless it was for bathroom or food, then after I was ""ungrounded"" from the room I was allowed to be in public areas but my father would basically act like I was a ghost and would not address me or respond). Wonderful environment for a kid huh? ;) During this period there was some rebelling on my part, i.e. piercing my own nose and smoking cigarettes, but nothing too mind-blowing. After some good grades (and still not being spoken to by my father), I was given 3 hour non-internet access on the family computer to complete homework assignments, and a lovely 30 minute allowance to ""play"" on the internet. I didn't know it at the time, but my father also installed a keylogger and regularly reviewed my history, and I was frequently punished whenever I would visit a ""bad"" website or say something bad about my family on the internet (took me long enough to figure out what a keylogger was). I looked up the abortion pill once out of curiosity, and had my internet privileges restricted and my mother promptly informed me that women who took that pill would almost certainly die. 
I continued living in this hell hole, rebelling here and there (my parents would find an empty cigarette carton, or I would be a little late for my curfew, or I would be caught masturbating.. no joke, kind of embarrassing to admit it though). When I was 16, my parents caught me sneaking out to a friend's goodbye party, and they simply had enough with me and my dad packed a little gym bag full of clothes and sent me on my way. I crashed at a boyfriends house, dropped out of school (you try even giving a shit about school after that happens), and got a job graphic designing and bartending (I lived overseas so being underage was not even questioned, and my 20y.o bf was already in the industry so he hooked me up). This is not as bad as it sounds, trust me, it was a relief from what I had known. I was in touch with my mother, who would sometimes want to see me just to see how I was doing and to slip me some pocket money. Anyway, after a little less than a year, I felt like a fucking loser and like I wasn't getting anywhere. I knew I had to make it back to the US where there was at least some chance of me getting ahead. I literally called up a ""meeting"" with my parents, and my dad and mom both pretty much knew that I was asking for forgiveness. They decided it was best for me to ""start fresh"" and to move to the US to finish high school. I left within the next two weeks and finished my senior year of high school on my own, getting rent payments from my parents and just kind of bs-ing thru the year. I got like a 4.5 or something ridiculous, went to a so-so UC school, and here I am at age 20. I am sooo grateful that my parents are financially supporting me. They have paid all my college expenses and even offer a small allowance for living expenses. I cannot ever be thankful enough. But you know what? I have been fucking acting for the past 3 years, ever since I called them back up for forgiveness. I have been an entirely different person. I know we all hide our personality to an extend with parents, but I fucking seriously hide it. I am an entirely different person, to the point where I sometimes can't keep a straight face because honestly, it's ridiculous. The problem is, how do I keep a healthy detachment going? How can I cope with my parents? I am so sick and tired of playing a different role but since they are supporting me, I cannot be an ungrateful little brat. Today they told me to my face that I should not pursue X career (career I have been working towards for the past few years) because I simply can't cut it, simply not the type, simply can't cope with the type of people. It was basically another way of telling me that I am not smart enough. This is the same kind of thing they've told me my entire life, yet I have proved them wrong every single time. I was my class president for 3 years in a row, high school drop out maybe.. but I ended up in university with a 3-year double major both with highest honors. I tell them over and over again that I can do it, that I can cut it, but I just feel like a useless shithead like I have my whole life. I'm so sorry reddit for this huge ass wall text. Honestly I need some advice, some perspective, even just a comment from a redditor who has any clue what the fuck I should do. I am very very grateful for everything they have done to help me. But they like the act I am putting up, not the person I really am. I am stuck here for the rest of Xmas so it would be nice to have some redditor opinions.. 

TL;DR: parents super strict, I've been a sobfest about it for the past decade, need to detach but not financially dependent. 

edit 12/24/10: thank you for your comments.. just wanted to keep you wonderful lovely people updated, but I had my first panic attack yesterday. I'm ashamed to say I always considered panic attacks to be some sign of weakness, or some gesture of defeat, but after yesterday I feel immense respect for anyone who can carry themselves through such a scary experience. I think both my anxiety with food and my relationship with my parents is causing it, I really thought I was about to die and have been barely able to leave my bedroom or even hear my sister's voice. How surreal.. I feel like an insane person. ",4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ep85m/how_to_detach_from_parents_at_the_very_least_how/,1292919113
epb6f,depression,MrSad,Fat and Sad,"Hi every body,
Ok, so I'm not going to bore you with my **whole** life story, but i'll tell you a little. I'm an obese 21 year old male (319lbs), I have struggled with my weight since I was 5 years old and have been thinking.

I have thought about my situation and I seriously think I have had depression since I was around 13 years old, that's the earliest I can remember.It is quite possible I have been depressed from an even younger age since for my entire life my family has done nothing but want me to lose weight, which is understandable but you wont believe some of the things my mum has said to me, how many times i've cried wishing I could change. Its like everybody, my family, my doctors, they didn't care about how **I** felt about the things they were putting me through, only that I needed to change.

Recently I lost some weight, 20kg to be exact. Everything was going well, I was abit happier then it all just stopped and regained it and quite possibly some more, it always happens. I just lose motivation and start feeling sorry for myself. 

So, recently I have been thinking, trying to find a pattern in my yoyo weight loss, and what I think I have found is that I peak and trough in and out of depression, and when I'm not depressed I feel normal and motivated, this is where I lose weight. 

I'm not sure of the medical symptoms of depression, but I have a strong feeling I am.

-I often feel tired, even after waking up after a 12 hour sleep.
-I lose motivation, focus and passion for the things I normally love.
-Intense feelings of hopelessness and insignificance.
-Just don't care about anything attitude.

Its been like this for years, on and off, feeling ok then intense loneliness. Recently in the last year and a half I have also become what I can only explain as detached from myself and everything else around me, like, as im writing this I feel terrible emotionally but in my mind im judging myself, saying how stupid this is and how I should just get over it, that im trying to find excuses, others to blame etc.

I really don't know what to do, I should see a doctor but Im embarrassed about this, what right do I have to be depressed? Everything that is 'wrong' in my life is nothing compared to other peoples? 

I just wanted to tell some body, sorry for wasting your time.

eq7bn,depression,besoin_de_psychiatre,"Having one's self-esteem contingent on intimate relationships, and the joys of weight-related stigma and isolation","I'm not really sure if this is the right venue, but it seemed more appropriate than /r/OffMyChest. I guess the holidays bring out the worst in a lot of depressives, and I'm no exception. 

I'm a long time depression sufferer, I've been coping okay with the help of a daily 150mg of effexor. Until September, when I moved cities, I was seeing a psychiatrist regularly. I've been meaning to find a new one where I live and perhaps a separate psychologist/therapist/counselor.

By far, it seems, my biggest problem is that my self-esteem and sense of self-worth seems to be inextricably tied to being in a relationship, or at least perceiving that I *could* be in a relationship if I wanted to be. Right now, I feel like there's nobody out there with whom I could have that kind of connection.

I was dumped by my last girlfriend in February '07, after which we kinda still hung around each other until about January '08, when she finally decided that I was a hindrance to her moving on and just forced me out of her life completely. I was a wreck for a good portion of the intervening year and *really* a wreck for the first part of 2008, until about April or May. I've been on a handful of dates since then, not for lack of trying, but nothing has stuck, and it eats me up. Either she lost interest or I wasn't sufficiently attracted, or something didn't feel right... I always blame myself, probably not entirely fairly. 

Despite being in that last relationship for 2.5 years, I'm still a virgin (she was neurotic about pregnancy, and never went to the doctor for that pill prescription she wanted in addition to condoms... and I didn't push it because that would've made me a horrible human being, right?). Turning 26 next month having never had sex presents some further challenges, since people assume, in adult relationships, that if you're not a religious type and you've been in a committed relationship before then you have at least *some* experience with sex. Not so for me.

A big part of my problem is I'm overweight (partly due to a length of time I spent on a particularly high dose of effexor) and I have zero confidence as a result. I don't even bother approaching women in person, no matter if they seem like they might be receptive to such advances from *other* people. I occasionally send messages on OKCupid, but response rates are pretty low there in general, and I'm no exception of course. I'm pretty sure listing your ""body type"" as ""a little extra"" is a red flag for most people.

I've tried losing weight but staying motivated when you can't even picture the goal is really, really hard. The worst part is that I actually have to *think* about my weight on a daily basis when I'm making such an effort, and that requires an enormous amount of emotional energy. **Normally, the only way I make it through the day without crying is to walk around mostly *forgetting* what I look like, and avoiding mirrors.** My chemical dependence on a metabolism-destroying antidepressant doesn't help any of this, though it does shorten my attention span enough to stop me from ruminating.

The worst part is the dread I have that fixing my weight problem won't solve my relationships problem, or my self-esteem-as-defined-by-relationships problem. I think it's entirely possible I could wind up at approximately normal weight for my age and height (though that's almost unimaginable in the first place) and still have the same trouble I have now just because this negative self-image has been with me for so long. 

tl;dr fatty depressive is unwillingly single, tortured by inability to connect intimately, worried he is permanently damaged such that getting rid of the fat won't solve the problem.

I'm not sure what I expect to take away from the responses but I'll be happy to hear them. Really I'm just happy someone might read this... it's incredibly hard to talk to most people in my life about this.",24,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eq7bn/having_ones_selfesteem_contingent_on_intimate/,1293069983
eq8us,depression,Poison1990,I was depressed and now I'm pretty okay. Don't loose hope. ,"I used to suffer from depression and I found myself visiting here quite a bit, either making posts myself or looking at others to remind myself I wasn't alone.
A year ago I was miserable and discontent with life. I ending up making a lot of mistakes and cheated on my long term girlfriend who I loved dearly, broke up, and fell into a pit of what seemed like never ending sadness and self pity. Thoughts of killing myself were triggered by the tiniest of things and I cried so hard because I felt taking my own life was inevitable. I had no one I could talk to, no social life, and I spent hours and hours lying on my bedroom floor, or in my shower just hoping I could summon the courage to put an end to my suffering. 

Over the past quarter I haven't visited r/depression or SW at all because I haven't needed to. I'm a very different person now. So I was just thinking about how far I'd come and just wanted to leave a message to anyone in a similar position to how I was.

Have hope, because there is a cure for your depression, you just have to find it.
It maybe a case of just waiting for your life to change, or it may require you to take more active steps.

I had counselling, and I was on meds, I tried jogging and cycling, and drawing, and writing my feelings down. None of these were the cure by themselves. Perhaps it was the combination, perhaps it was none of them, or perhaps it was just time. 

Whatever, just please don't give up on yourself and take the easy way out as I was far too tempted to. 
If you are feeling anything like how I felt, then you're probably not convinced. I don't blame you. But you're just going have to trust me on this.

Anyway, that's all I have to say. It's not as articulate as I'd like, but I've always had trouble expressing my thoughts. 

If you feel like venting your problems to a stranger feel free to send me a pm. I almost guarantee that I won't be able to help but you might feel better for it.

I wish you the best of luck and don't forget to love yourself

I literally spent over 4 hours today just trying to find someone on the internet. I'm so socially awkward around girls and I have no idea where to go to meet them, so I resort to the internet to solve my loneliness problems. I really should tell my parents, but I can't bring myself to tell them. The crushing loneliness I'm feeling right now is terrible.

Diagnosed with clinical depression a few years ago. Gone through maybe three psychiatrist/counselors? (I don't know their actual titles). That was largely ineffective because I wasn't ready and willing to put it all out there. I feel like I'm ready to find a proper therapist (not a prescription sheet machine) but do to constraints out of my control I can't at the moment.

I enact things in my mind a lot, daydream, fantasize. Sometimes I'm sitting with a therapist, getting it all out, which feels therapeutic in it's own right. Sometimes I'm in a coffeeshop shooting the shit with friends that don't exist. I sheltered myself from the world for a long time, in a basement of course, I think these two above plays in my mind are there because I deeply desire that human connection. 

Sometimes I fantasize scenarios that are unpleasant, yet therapeutic in a disturbing way. Different scenarios come and go, but they all usually have a common theme, some sort of dire medical situation that changes my life. One I used to have a while ago was that I had a brain tumour and had to have open skull surgery. Blah blah blah it changed my life and made me who I envision myself being in the future. So basically I'm waiting for a deus ex machina of sorts to save me

 Meanwhile in reality, I've had a bit of minor surgery (long ago) to know that the smell of alcohol disinfectant in a clinical setting is enough to make my knees weak. That thread in askreddit today about dead bodies? It's got me thinking I won't go visit my family on the 25th because that would mean driving 250km (one way) on busy highways in whats shaping up to be slick conditions. There was an iama about a hemophobe, someone afraid of blood. Someone mentioned that such a thing has something to do with supressed rage, which might explain a lot, as a lot of my daydreams involve lots of anger.

Well I don't feel like I've gotten it out properly here, I guess at the moment my biggest concern is in the latter paragraph and feel that's kind of urgent and why I'm rushing to submit this, so fuck it, I'm gonna hit submit and see where that takes us.

I can't take the life I have anymore. 
I have great family and friends, but I can't function anymore. Even though I am a very high-strung person, I have always been able to function. I've recently gotten 10x worse and keep buckling down everyday. 


This semester at school I did absolutely horrible. I've fairly certain I'm going to loose my scholarship and just that fact makes me majorly depressed. I want to come home for next semester, I just don't know how to tell my family. I've tried to get help while I am away at school, but it just isn't helping. The most they were able to give me was once every two weeks (and that was after the 3 weeks it took to get me an appointment) and that is not cutting it.


I have been home from school for less than 1 week and I already have an apointment with a psychologist for monday (which I was able to schedule today). 
I am really hoping this will start to help me and I am fairly sure it will but I am just afraid for when I go back to my university in a month. I know I can't get the help I need there and I am afraid I will get worse if I go back. I just want to feel sane and happy for more than a week at a time. 


I feel so much pressure in telling my family of my failures. I have always been an excellent student and it has always jsut been expected of me and now I don't know what to do. I am just so depressed and so angry I f*cked up. 


I'm so angry at my school as well for not helping me when I asked. What are the health services I pay for in my tuition/room &amp; board good for if they can't help me when I need it?


I'm so worried to go back now, I have had suicidal thoughts for years and after things getting so much worse, I am afraid of what stupid things I may do. 


Just to let you know how my anxious, over achieving mind fuctions:
Last year I recieved a B, I was depressed and mentally beat myself over it for weeks in addition to having numerous fleeting thoughts of suicide. This semester I failed two classes...


What stresses me out more is that I don't know how to even come home next semester if I decide to. I spoke with my school and they said students typically need to be in good standing to recieve approval for visiting student status at another college. I don't want to drop out of my school, I just want to be where I can recieve the treatment I need and feel safe. I also don't know what I would do if I couldn't continue taking classes while I was home. I would go crazy without something to occupy me. 


I know this is a rant but can someone offer me any advise? I know I am speaking to someone soon but I am just really upset today and feel extremely trapped. Has anyone else had to come home for a semester to recieve the help they needed and then went back to their univeristy?

eqyer,depression,AdversaryWithin,Flunked out of college. /life,"I'm going to be blunt. I am completely and utterly fucked. Backstory (I'll keep this short as possible): 

22 M, rich family, my dad lived the hard knocks life and made his own way out of poverty to graduate college and become a successful businessman. I'm a highly intelligent guy but I never applied myself much in school, and I got into the same college simply because my dad went there. I changed a lot in college. I became aware of what I was squandering, and it became the focus of my life to see to it that I not waste anymore of my potential and live up to what I should be. 

Then, sometime around a year and a half ago, the depression hit me hard. Every single day for over a year now I have had thoughts of suicide. It used to be that there were good days and bad days; good days are when I didn't have those thoughts, bad days are when they crept up again. I don't have good days anymore, just less bad days. 

There is a part of me that desperately wants to die, and has conspired to push me to this end. It has taken my girlfriend of 3 years, it has taken my friends, it has taken my mind. Last spring I was in the throes of a complete and utter breakdown. No one would see it happen, of course, I just remove myself from sight when the pain becomes overwhelming. 

Anyway, I got put on academic probation. This semester, I finally sought out therapy and got put on Sertraline (Zoloft), but it was too little too late. I couldn't focus on my work. Even though I got extensions for all of my assignments at the end of the semester, I failed to meet the balance of my requirements and have failed out of three classes. 

I have flunked out of college, just like the depression wanted me to do. Just like it wanted me to lose the love of my life. Now, it wants to take my life. This has been the sole obsession of the last year, and despite my best efforts to stop it, I have failed. 

If I do not graduate college, I will kill myself. 100% chance. Maybe not right away, maybe not in a few weeks or months, maybe not even for a year or so, but it will happen. I just simply won't be able to live this down. I'll never be able to forgive myself. I've been given every privilege, every advantage, every second chance... yet I still fucked up. Hundreds of thousands of dollars spent over a lifetime of college-prep private school, tutoring, and college tuition down the drain. So much good I could have done for the world... gone. And I'll never get a second chance again. 

My parents don't know. I've lied to them, right up to the end. I told them everything was okay, because I wanted to make everything *be* okay... they trusted me, I broke that trust. When this hits, it'll hit harder than anything else in the world. I swear, I wanted to get those assignments in. I really did. Honest to fucking god I did. But every time I'd sit down to work on one, all that anxiety would flood back and overwhelm me, and I'd resume my desire to die. I took refuge in distractions, and have a 20,000 karma account to show for it. Awesome. (Hell, it's not reddit's fault. If it wasn't reddit, it would be something else.) 

It's too late to do anything now. Final grades are due today. I couldn't just do all my work now and then beg for a miracle from my professors. They like me, but they don't owe me that, and it would be a sin to ask them. Maybe it would be a sign of good faith, and maybe with a letter to the dean showing them that I am fucked up, and I failed because I was fucked up in the head, and that they should let me back for another semester and just count this one as incomplete... shit, I don't know. It's probably impossible. I'll never get back into that college. Even if I did, it wouldn't matter. I'd still have to face my family and... jesus fuck, I don't even want to think about that. 

What do I do, reddit? Seriously, what are my options here? I can't take medical leave, the semester is over. Grades due today. The desire to die is haunting me stronger than ever.

er7lj,depression,SeriousAboutSuicide,For your consideration.,"I've been off my Zoloft a few days, not necessarily a good thing, but in being detached from the chemically-encouraged state of normalcy, my mind's been racing as it tends to when undermedicated with all sorts of thoughts. 

As another Christmas day dawns, with another particularly trying year coming to a close, I find myself dwelling in the butcher shop of a playground in the darkest corners of my emotions. Paranoia, homicidal fantasies about people who've wronged me, suicidal thoughts. 

The usual.

While disturbing, to be sure, I've realized something. That were I to take the plunge, as it were, and indulge in my desire for revenge, followed by my desire for the ultimate peace that death seems to promise, while my life would be over, that of those I would leave behind would be shattered.

When you take the time to review your trail through life, to see what you've achieved, however trivial you might believe it to be, it's had an impact, most poignantly upon your friends, loved ones, coworkers, even pets. What happens, though, when you imagine yourself removed from the picture? You might visualize your wife crying as she tries to pack up your things, part of her yearning to just toss gasoline on it all and light it up to not face the sorrow of picking through the memories. Your coworkers might wander around, numb in shock that someone whom they worked with day after day finally went ""postal"". Your dog might lay on some worn old t-shirt still possessing some of your scent, wondering where mom or dad went.

Sometimes the brain seems to ooze entropy, leaving one with an unquiet mind when tranquility would be far more pleasant. While disconcerting, this little trek outside my zone of normality has helped me realize how the brain, chemically, can sway our judgement, our logic, our heart, sometimes far afield from the well-travelled paths that define our morality or our sense of purpose in life, and indeed obscure the borders between these and insanity.

I love my wife, my friends, a few of my coworkers, and my dogs. This may be my one and only shot with them, and their one and only shot with me. I do not want to indulge in my desire for revenge and to terminate my own suffering by doing the equivalent of ripping the roots of my life, intertwined over time with the roots of those I love, out and away from the earth I'm grounded in. 

I hope, if any of you are considering this hard choice, you achieve the clarity to realize that life, if only for yourself, is worth living, regardless of how the ""meat"", your organ, the brain, might twist that delicate notion around to spite you.

Meanwhile, I've cut my overall spending to something that's manageable with the albeit little credit card debt that I have.  I'm fairly comfortable with job security at the moment, so I could buy something for myself, but the truth is, there's nothing that I want.  The necessities are covered, and I feel like that's enough.

My friends wouldn't take me seriously, and no one could get me the help that I needed.  These dreams have been bugging me a lot lately.

I still have happy moments, i think.  I feel like crying right now, but I can't quite get there.  I told my mom just earlier that I was feeling depressed, and she asked me if I was feeling suicidal.  I don't really.  Sometimes I wish I would just collapse, or get hit by a car, or something like that.  Something that's out of my control.  I don't know.

I know there's help out there.  I could go talk to someone, or pick up the phone, but especially with that suicide helpline, I don't want to call in and tie up a line.

Now you may enter the exciting world of world and related expenses. Lucky Lucky you!

Mom and Dad are soooo happy they no longer have the financial responsibilities that came with you attending the educational housing units (good thing apartment life is cheaper than dorms) that you have entered. And they are looking forward to you paying room and board.

Having you home safe and sound from these hard work experiences of that dreaded Disney and home from that awful place in Italy. I don't know how you were able to stand it knowing that your mother dearest was home waiting by the phone for your next frantic call.

Next year holds fun and exciting journeys for you. Payable gigs such that you have already been accepted to will bring you much happiness.

Good luck my dear dear Nicole, I am so happy that you will be buying your own car, paying for the insurance, gas, and repairs that I may even give Rudolf a kiss!

Love to you!
Love Santa


__________________________________________________________

Background on this:

This was written by my mother.

Yeah I did graduate, my mother did not...apparently she's jealous and making it seem like my college graduation is worth nothing to make her feel better.

I am currently living at home because I cannot afford a place of my own and I was told it would be in my best interest to save up money to get a place. Since I was strictly forbidden from getting my own apartment because of health insurance reasons.

When I went to my first college they had no dorms, but it was in a really rural area and thus the apartments were cheaper than dorms really urban universities...but they like to tell me I'm a huge liar even though I stayed in a dorm and it was cheaper the second half of college...


I was in Disney World just recently doing the Disney College Program but it had nothing to do with my major (theatre) and it was just making me extremely depressed...so I quit.

When I was in Italy the high altitude messed with the doses of my medication and made it really hard there. I finished cause it was my last semester in college.but im sure I would have had a better time if I wasn't so depressed.

The ""Payable gigs"" thing....I have callbacks for performance gigs which I haven't gotton yet....so she's humouring me.

I can't afford a car as of now...my car exploded in the summer...so im trying to save up to get one. But obviously Santa thinks I can't.


My sisters letter from Santa basically says how amazing she is. I'm sick of how im treated and I wish I could leave, but id rather deal with this than be homeless. I'm really depressed and I'm sick of being told how much a failure I am. I can only handle so much. And for someone who knows I'm on medication and everything all she does is taunt me and make me feel like I'm worthless....

Perhaps it's the realization that staying with my folks probably wouldn't make me feel any better.

Perhaps it's the idea that my in-laws hate me for moving their son across the country for my job, for encouraging his departure from Christianity by simply being an atheist, and for being bat-shit crazy.

Perhaps it's the gray Pacific NW that robs me of all motivation in the winter.

Perhaps it's this horrible pseudo hangover I have, even though I didn't drink a drop yesterday.

Perhaps it's the vivid memory of being committed to a psych ward on Christmas 5 years ago.

erj9t,depression,wheeldog,Gotta power through this.,"I left Arizona a decade ago. I left my mom here, her and her adopted 'son', some guy that supposedly takes care of her. No one in the family really likes him but she does.
 Anyhow I asked her if I could come back to live with her while I go to college. I saved up 2000 bucks, and got my car going good, and packed up and quit my job and came to live with her after getting accepted to the University.
 I get here and find that she is really living like an animal. I've blown through most of my savings trying to get her car fixed up, got some propane in the propane tank so we can have some heat, been going around with my brother (he's only here for a week) trying to get stuff fixed up. Everything is a shambles. So much trash here because she can't afford to have trash pick up service. And she has no insurance on her truck, no registration (it lapsed), and a broken tail light.
 We got it new spark plugs, air filter etc. but it needs a lot of work. so does the house. so does the entire property. Junk everywhere, trash, outbuildings fallen in... I was doing fine until I got here, now my depression seems to be coming back with a vengeance.
 I was so excited about going to school but seeing my mom like this, and having no job yet (I've only been out of work for a week but it seems like a year with all the money I've blown through)... my brother and I are just in disbelief. I had no idea things were this bad here. She lives a ways out of town... and with the bad truck, she rarely leaves the property. She's lost touch with the world it seems, except for the Mormon church people she hangs out with, they do help her a lot but mostly she just stays in her room watching movies on tv.
 She's old now, and hunchbacked, and I don't know how to deal with her, she lives in the past. I'm kind of devastated at the state everything out here is in and the depression worries me. 
 I just needed to rant, I'm terrified of running out of money, I have bills to pay! And I was just getting my credit straightened out. I hope I can find a job very soon. I start school in a few days, and I have parking permit and books to buy: I'm not sure I can make it through all this. If I dont find a job I'm pretty screwed. frightened, terribly.
 The 'adopted' son, the con man who ws here when i left, he's not here  and apparently he just leaves her here to fend for hrself all the time. He's been gone for about a year this time.",6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/erj9t/gotta_power_through_this/,1293341726

But I just feel like a big faker and that I have to keep up a facade of happiness at all times.  I love my job, but can't get up the motivation to go beyond just going through the motions and doing the bare minimum.

I just feel like life doesn't have a point.  I try to be a good person, volunteer, give to charity, etc.  Christmas is especially hard on me because almost all the traumatic things that have happened in my life happened on Christmas or in the holiday season.  I just can't stop crying.

erkzv,depression,swio,Omega 3/Fish oil tablets. Does it work for you and how much ?,"I found that depression reduced when I was on diet to lose weight that involved me eating alot of fish.

I then read about the link between omega 3 and depression. So I started taking about three 1000mg fish oil capsules a day. Over time it helped, but was still up and down a bit.

Then I read another weight loss book that suggested at least ten 1000mg fish oil capsules a day. That sounds like a lot, but its not actually a drug, just a form of food really and not expensive. 

So I started taking around fifteen 1000mg tablets every day. I figured it can't hurt and three capsules helped, maybe more will help more. I have found its pretty much cured depression after a month or two. I don't know for sure that the fish oil and end of depression are directly linked. Maybe it was something else that I have not realised that caused the change, but I'm pretty confident the link is there for me.

None of this is with the help of doctors or therapists. I have self diagnosed and never sought out help from a professional. But I have read alot and run through self diagnostic questionnares so I'm pretty confident that my assessment of my mental state is roughly correct.

I was wondering has anybody else had a similar experience and found it worked? or it didnt' work? Or for people who are struggling with depression would you consider trying this? It's cheap and easy and does not seem to have any risk.",25,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/erkzv/omega_3fish_oil_tablets_does_it_work_for_you_and/,1293354764
erse9,depression,fattyacid13,I don't get why I lie to myself,"I work 14 hours a day. I make a living, but I hate this. I just don't know what else to do...

I'm in the military. Currently undergoing one of the more intellectually challenging and mentally stressful training programs there is. I've just had 70 college credits worth of classes shoveled down my throat in the last year, and have now been undergoing the hands-on training portion. I spend almost all my waking time at work. I cut back on sleep to give me a little more time with the internet, my best link to the outside world until I can get a car...

I was sent to New York from the south with only 8 days notice. I managed to find a place with a friend I'd made from the smoking area at work. We're living in a house owned by a very rich old guy, who is creepy as fuck. I feel uncomfortable being in the same room with him, but the rent's cheap and it's very close. This is good, because I'm counting on my roommate for transportation to work every day. The alternative would be walking to work in the snow. However, between the heavy workload and hours of dealerships and lack of my own mode of transportation, it's been extremely difficult to acquire a vehicle of my own.

I've been nominally dating this girl for the past 5 months (as of the 02Jan)... She has defeated every chance I've had to see her, though. Now, having spent Christmas away from home for the first time (and yet feeling bad most about the fact that I don't feel bad about not being home), we've officially cancelled it, because it's just too much of an emotional drain on me when every glimmer of happiness and love I've felt has had the undertone of being a dream, a lie, or just a stupid delusion I've tricked myself into believing out of pure desperation.

I've been told I'm not entirely unattractive, and many female friends agree that I have a wonderful personality that is readily apparent in the way I speak, and yet I don't have any confidence when it comes to actually making the play myself. The only times I have, I told myself not to because I was ""with"" this girl.

Worst off, I've always had an active imagination, and seen glimpses of scary things in my mind's eye since I was a kid... But usually in the dark or by myself. I've started having weird mental images of people dying, even in well-lit areas when surrounded by people... When I was on the subway a couple of days ago, this cute Asian girl walked past me as she got off the subway... and after she walked past this pillar, I don't know why, but the most disturbing image of her being shot in the face played through my mind. I can't believe I've been able to contain myself.

A few times, my friend and I were in the subways, and he'd stand near the edge... Yeah, just impatience and wanting to get on the train sooner, but it made me so so so nervous like I was going to have a panic attack if he wouldn't step back from the edge.

I need help, but being in the military, I'm afraid to seek assistance, or else I'll lose this all and my chance at a wonderful career in the future. I still have about $17k in college debt looming over my head, not to mention the fact that I'll lose my steady paycheck and only chance at getting a car... If I seek medical assistance, I'll be administratively separated and lose everything I've worked for, all the stress I've gone through, all the emotional pain of realizing that I know the technical and conceptual details and systems that I work with in immense detail, and yet I can't remember a whole lot of what I ever did before I joined the military... It wasn't even a full year and a half ago, goddammit! Why can't I remember back that far as clearly as I can remember everything I've learned in these training programs? I hate this. HATE IT. The worst part is, it's something I really want to pursue as a real career when I get out, though on a different side of the industry. In the meantime, I can't stand this.

...But I have to put up with it. What else am I going to do, go back to working in fast food and living with my parents? They have enough load; my brother and uncle are both living with them while they get *their* lives put back together. Plus, my mom's mom died at the end of last month... I can't imagine she's really as fine as she tries to sound on the phone.

I don't know what else I can do. I don't know if I'm strong enough. My only option is to suck it up and see it through. I don't know if I can, but it's my only option...

edit: Even before, when I was doing very well in the schooling with (in all honesty) only a bare minimum effort, when I was running regularly, in good shape, doing well for myself, going out with friends every weekend... I was still depressed. I really only managed to snap out of it by being in a relationship... One of being quite desperate, with a girl I didn't really like and wasn't physically attracted to and honestly annoyed the fuck out of me with her stupid fantasies. It lasted two weeks. I couldn't even keep it up inside of her. It became pretty obvious that this wasn't really going to be a thing. The depression returned a few months later, as loneliness set back in. I snapped myself out of it by meeting the girl I just ended it with... Now, I've come to realize that was never going to work out, and I'd just been lying to myself the whole time.

ertg7,depression,JustNotWorkingAtAll,I just don't feel like doing anything...,"I'm 17 and I still don't have any plans for myself. My family emigrated here in Europe to have a better life. I have been living here for three years already. And days go by, the life here on what I expected to be was far from what I thought. In exchange for having a decent life, bad things keep happening to me.

Making friends here is completely different in my home country. People I've met are very friendly to me in comparison to where I was born. In here, you don't see people see your mistakes at all. If they were to see you do something foolish, they don't mind at all. It's like every person wants their environment to be. I'm not used to it. I know it is weird but I just feel I don't belong here. Blending in this kind of environment feels uncomfortable to me. 

Being at school made me feel like a nobody. Even though you had those friendly people around you, it did not work (It was hopeless). At the end of the school year, I made zero progress of having friends. Yes, I talked to some people in my class and in other classes as well but none of them was really a friend for me. 

Then we moved to another city which was quite excited since it is near to my relatives after a year. There lived my cousins, uncle and aunt. One of my cousin was the one who I was very close with. We hang out most of the time we meet. He introduced me to his friends. He belonged in a youth group. From there, I met people who are younger, same and older than me. It felt like home talking to people who spoke the same language and came from the same place. This is where I met a very special girl. 

I was clueless at that time. I am not going to brag but she fell for me badly. She would call me or text me whenever she could. We had our happy moments and memories It's every guy would want to be with. I was interested in her but I could not express it. All I did was to tell her things over the chat which I did not do at all. There was all talk but nothing was done. It is quite pathetic that she was about to leave but I told her to stay and give me another chance. But I blew all of it. As we were visiting another youth group just next to the city, I saw an attractive girl. At first I hesitated to talk to that girl but I found a chance. While we were there, I would most of the time talk to that girl. Ignoring the one who I made a promise with. I was so ignorant that I did not notice what I did. Finally she gave up on me and I let her go.

After a few months, I felt that something was missing. How I missed out every chance to stay by her side. I was pathetic thinking every moment that I hurt her. She finally came to our house with her parents. I talked about and how sorry I am and if I were given a chance, I would not mess it up again. And she said something that made me realize that it was already over. That she already moved and so should I. This made me regret all the stupid things I did to her.

After more than a year, I still couldn't move on. I kept looking over pictures of her and try talking to her. But it was not the same anymore. The guilt had me clinging to her memories and lingering on the past. It really hurts to see someone go away from your life.

This event was only one of the things that I hated to happen. My uncle had a conflict with my mom. It was about me quitting on a position of the group. This made my uncle hate me. And really affected my relationship with not only him but to my cousin as well. IT all came falling down. 

Losing people you loved really hurt. I never had any contact with them. It became a huge impact on me which really kept me thinking. I am very depressed. I already went to a therapist and it did not help not even a little. I feel helpless and nothing to turn to not even my mother. She already had enough problems struggling to feed and I would not want to be a nuisance. I keep telling to myself that it would be okay but its not. With all these happened to me, I lost my motivation. I lost interest on what I like to do most. Nothing really makes me happy now.

eru3e,depression,wintersadness100,Back in a slump...,"Hey guys.
Background - depression settled in throughout senior year in highschool.  External and internal reasons.  Freshman in college now.  Took a while to even feel as though I was getting better.  The last three weeks have been the happiest of the past 2 years (started running, writing more, all kinds of stuff).  But now we're back in a slump.

I'm home for a couple weeks, and I feel really lonely.  It's not as biting as the loneliness I felt last year, but it's pretty deep.  It's snowing heavily out, and I feel like I SHOULD be snuggled up with some cute girl watching movies (just watched the end of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, made things worse).  I guess a lot of it has to do with being home instead of at school.  I do have friends around here, but I associate the majority of them with last year and letting me down when I really needed it, and not really understanding the nature/severity of what I was going through.

What should I do?  How do I avoid the loneliness? What can I do to keep this from happening again in the future?  Anyone wanna just shoot the shit about whatever?  Perhaps a pump-up speech is in order?

erzo0,depression,btrthnu,Lost everything,"In the past 4 years I've lost everything pretty much. I quit grad school without getting my doctorate, I'm deep in debt, I got divorced, and now I'm back home living with my parents at age 37. The worst part however is that this year, in a fit of rage, I lost my best friend. Somehow I just got so mad at him I sent him about 100 violently angry e-mails and serially called him, yelling. I even got so mad I went to his house to confront him, but when he came to the door he was like 'you better get going' so I left. Anyway, this is my best friend of 15 years -- i helped hm move, helped during his divorce, he helped during mine, he knows all my secrets. 

[TL;DR I lost my fucking best friend. It's worse than losing everything else in my life -- my career, my wife, my money.]

anyway, i thought i was dealing ok, but then on Xmas i realize, fuck, i can't give my friend an Xmas call. It's the most horrible feeling in the world -- he was really my only close friend.

Also!! I only recently got out of a marriage where my wife was verbally abusive to me, as well as abusing me in other ways. Also, I saw a lot of verbal abuse growing up, because my father would drink too much and get abusive. I think I may have acted like this due to simply the stress and anxiety of being at a crossroads, but my past also has something to so with it. Also, my ability to ""grow up"" and start my own life has been impaired because of a limiting and disabling O.C.D., which I'm in therapy for.

Thanks for your honest replies -- it's nice to get an objective opinion. I've tried to make things up with my friend, but maybe I just wasn't ready; maybe in a couple years when my life is back on track, I can perceive things from a distance, and then actually understand what I've done.

es7dr,depression,discardable3141,Frustration,"This would be a throwaway account - for what I think are obvious reasons. I'm upset. Frustrated, bored. I'm almost 30 years old, on disability. I'm fat and have terrible acne. I feel like an entire decade was stolen from me. Now I all I can think of is the hideous impending future barrelling down on me. I'm getting older. I broke my ankle, and it still hurts. Who the hell knows how long it will hurt for? I may have pain from it for the rest of my life.

Disability pays only barely enough to live on. I desperately wanted to get an iPhone 4 today, and I already have a 3gs. That was when I learned that the only way to upgrade is to either activate it on a new plan, and swap sim cards(so that mom would get the current 3gs). The only other way involves paying $600 for one. That was the impetus for my current mood. It's petty, but it's not the real reason I'm so upset.

I'm upset because god isn't real, the fairy tale I was told as a child was nothing but a lie. I'm upset because I'm pretty sure I'm bi, but was raised with very homophobic views so that my mind has a terrible time trying to deal with those feelings. I'm upset because there isn't a litmus test for bisexuality. I've come out to my friends about it... but who the hell knows the truth? I could be wrong. I certainly can't tell my parents about it.

I'm perpetually broke because of disability. Even the smallest extra expense can upset everything. Every day I see people my age with families and careers. Deep down, I loathe them for what they have.

I have to share the apartment with a roommate in order to live on my own. I constantly live with his interference in the organization of the place. 

So, I sit here on the verge of tears. I can handle the disappointment of not being able to get an iPhone 4. What kills me is my failure. My failure at managing money, at school, at life. Being 30 and on disability. I'm not asking for anything, I guess. I just needed to say a few things. Don't think I really feel any better after all that.

esd23,depression,Viriathus,A private pity-party you're invited to!,"I'm not sure if this is a rant, a pity party, venting, or something else entirely.  So I'll write what's on my mind and it'll be a jumbled mess, but maybe it'll help to get it out there.

I grew up as a military brat, and like many military kids I had wanted to enlist since I can remember.  I never wanted, nor planned, on going to college.  As such, I did poorly in high school, to the point I barely graduated, I figured, who cares?  I scored in the 90's in the ASVAB, which opens most if not all jobs in the Air Force.  Then I found out, I'm medically disqualified from enlisting.  I had pins in my arm from surgery, broke my arm, when I was 13, I also had scoliosis, and I saw a shrink when younger.  Great, you can get waivers for all of them which I did, to the point where I considered having the pins removed.  Long story short, it never went anywhere.  

Now since I never planned, nor wanted to go to college as stated, I had no back up plans.  So, I went to the local community college.  2003 rolls around and like most people I was feeling particularity patriotic, the US about to invade Iraq not long on the heels of 9/11?  I went to the Army recruiter, this time I got as far as the MEPS station.  When they started asking me questions I admitted I had seen a shrink, they already knew right?  Turns out, my Army recruiter neglected to put that on the paperwork.  Oops, if I had known, I would have lied about it.  So, I had to sit out MEPS, and arrived back at square one...again.

So, back to community college...again.  Around this time I met a girl who unfortunately I saw on average once or twice per week.  I always drove to see her, about 50 miles, and she never once visited me, which annoyed me to know end, and she knew it.  But, she hated driving, and I liked her.  Eventually we started drifting apart, and I, being an idiot, cheated.  Completely my fault, and unforgivable.  I never told her.

After I finished, I transferred to a local state school.  My first year there, was probably the most depressing I'd ever felt.  I had no friends, I didn't know anyone, and while within driving distance from home, what was the point?  I had one friend at home, and wasn't close to my family.  My ex and I started to talk again, and we even talked about getting back together.  In the middle of all this she started dating another guy, completely within her right, but, I felt betrayed.  Should I have?  Of course not, but I was lonely, depressed, angry, and like I said, felt betrayed.  So, in a fit of blind foolish anger, I told her I cheated on her while we were together.  I wanted her to feel the pain I thought she deserved for letting me think we'd get back together.  I know what you're thinking, that's pretty fucked up.  I know it is and I don't make any excuses for it anymore.  It took four years but we eventually became 'friends' again, we'd talk every once in a while, but not hang out.  Though every once in a while we still talk about getting back together, we both know it'd never work.  It took me those four years to finally forgive myself for what I did.

Anyways, back at school...I eventually made a friend who was surprisingly a lot like me, minus the anger I almost always felt.  He was honestly the only friend I made that year.  In my second year I made an effort to be more sociable, I was tired of being alone, depressed, and angry.  And you know what?  It worked, for who years I was pretty sociable.  I had a decent amount of friends.   I went to the occasional party, the first party I had ever been to?  I was 21-22.

So, I graduated and moved back home with my parents after getting a temp job working HR for a medical company.  But who cares right?  I have loads of friends now, people who want to hang out and shit.  Times a re still pretty good.  Eh, sort of.  Of all the 'friends' I made at college only two seemed to remember me after I graduated.  So, every once in a while I'd drive the 90 minutes to school and hang out for the weekend.

In Sept '09 my two best friends from college decided to move in together in the local city.  Sweet!  Best mates?  City life?  I thought we'd hang out, go out to bars, make loads of other friends, etc.  I mean, what could be better?  It'll be like How I Met Your Mother!  I'll be Ted.  Except, it wasn't like that.  Even a little.One of my roommates ended up getting a job working second shift, 3-11.  Well that sucks, and he went home every weekend, about 2 hours away, to see his girlfriend.  Well that sucks even more, this is the first friend I met at college.  I never felt any sort of grudge or anger towards him, but it would have been nice if he stayed home every once in a while to hang out with his roommates.  My other roommate, well, she's naturally sociable, she makes friends pretty quickly, pretty easily.  I, on the other hand, do not.  While I tend to come across as pretty serious, I also tend to joke around a lot.  Problem is, I say just about everything with a straight face, so people don't know when I'm joking or if I'm being serious.  So people tend to get angry with me.  Doesn't help that I'm a bit of an ass.  I freely admit that I don't understand why some people get offended so easily.  But everyone is different.  

Back to where I was.  For the year I lived in the city, I think I hung out with my sociable roommate  only a handful of times.  To her, hanging out was spending time together.  To me, hanging out was going *out* and doing something.  After getting out of work, I spent all my time in the apartment, so why would I want to hang out at it?  I wanted to go out, party, meet people, do what you're supposed to do as a 20-something living in the big city.  So while we hung out every once in a while it became increasingly more rare when she started dating someone, understandably so.

Once again, I fell into depression, to the point where, for no reason at all, I spent an hour crying on the sofa when I was home alone.  It was then I realized, maybeee I should get on kind of anti-depressant.  Mind you, I'd seen my fair share of therapists, but all they seemed to say was, 'why do you think that is?', well I don't fucking no, how about you tell me and try to help me out some.  Each was more worthless than the next.

esde7,depression,ApprenticeStoner,Does this make sense to anyone else?,"I will frequently, probably 1-2 times a day right now (but these numbers are extremely variable and difficult to estimate) feel a sudden wave of guilt, completely and utterly out of the blue. In the next few seconds, I struggle to place this emotion. On some days, my mind can't find any justification whatsoever for this guilt to exist, and it quickly fades. If, however, I am currently experiencing any negative emotions, this guilt will (try to) latch on to and greatly enhance them. Over time I have become much more adept than I once was at forcing this guilt to fade before it has a chance to find a seat within my mind, and I have also greatly improved at damage control if it succeeds in doing so. At the lowest points in my life, this strange guilt with no apparent origin has sent me into an emotional downward spiral resulting in seclusion and self hatred. 

Can anyone relate to this? I am really curious to hear your thoughts and input.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esde7/does_this_make_sense_to_anyone_else/,1293508924
esdtv,depression,lonely_geek,I *know* I can get through this - I just need a little help.,"In my peer group, *I'M* the stable one that people come to for help.  Everyone I know expects me to have my shit together 24/7 so I've resorted to creating a second username to ask internet strangers for assistance.  I already feel kind of like a jackass for even asking - I know there are people out there with worse problems than mine, but here goes.

The week before Christmas I got dumped by my girlfriend of 18 months.  Yes, I know, not even 2 years.  It still hurts.  Over the past few months it seemed like nothing I could do was good enough for her.  I finally found a job a few months ago (I was unemployed when we met), I had a challenging semester (group projects FTW!) and my mother got sick (she's doing better now btw).  Every time I would leave cookie crumbs on the counter or forget to change out the toilet paper or not wash a dish to her specifications or even make some off-hand remark that didn't sit quite right with her I would be accused of everything from not respecting her to cheating on her.  Every time she would make impossible demands (as there are only 24 hours in a day and I do require sleep) and I would jump through flaming hoops just to make her happy.  Every time it got worse and worse.

A couple of weeks ago I had JUST finished my last final exam of the semester (40+ hrs / week on salary + night classes).  As soon as I got out of the classroom I sent her a text asking what she was doing.  She responded that she was going to a local bar to watch a basketball game.  I told her that I was on my way and that I could not wait to see her.  Our normal routine (she works 40+ hrs / week as well) is usually seeing each other 1-2 nights during the week and spending the entire weekend together.  We tried (briefly) living together but that went over like a lead balloon.  I raced to the bar and waited for her to pull up.  As soon as she got there I jumped out of the car to give her a hug.  We went inside, found a good place to watch the game and ordered our drinks.  She and I had planned to have our Christmas on Saturday night (Dec 18) because she was going to visit her family in another state and I was planning on seeing MY family in another state.  Before our beers had arrived I said, ""Oh yeah - some friends of ours sent me a message today saying that they were going to spend Saturday afternoon delivering presents to everyone and wanted to know if we would be at your place so they could drop it off.  I told them yes, but don't worry - I'll go out and get something for us to give to them.""

She went absolutely APESHIT.  Now, what would have happened is they would have knocked on the door, said, ""Happy Holidays!"", given us the gift and we would have said, ""Same to ya!"" and given them their gift.  Takes 2 minutes tops.  According to my ex, I had INVITED them over to OUR PRIVATE CHRISTMAS, which meant that I had NO RESPECT for her and I obviously did NOT have ANY interesting in spending time with her at all.  She told me that it was over and that she deserved someone better than me.

I have heard that phrase so much over the past 6 months that it is the only thing I hear whenever I think about her.  My confidence is completely shot and I'm trying like hell to concentrate on the things that most normal people do without any effort (fold laundry, eat dinner, brush my teeth, shower, etc).  She's pulled this crap with me a couple of times and I always take her back when she calls me up crying.  This time, however, I noticed a facebook update from her not 24 hours after she dumped me.  She posted on a mutual friends' wall that she had cleared up her weekend plans and would love to attend her party.  I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm pretty sure that she was planning on going to that party all along but she didn't want me to be in the picture.  What I need from you guys is to tell me that it *will* get better and for God's sake PLEASE TELL ME NOT TO CONTACT HER.  Like the subject line says - I know that I am better off without her, I just need some help getting through this.

TLDR; Girlfriend dumped me the week before Xmas, has a history of saying abusive shit to me and then begging me to take her back days later, need encouragement to not take her back this time.",21,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esdtv/i_know_i_can_get_through_this_i_just_need_a/,1293510856
esene,depression,[deleted],"A long story, Please give it a read. (No tl;dr if you want just skip to last paragraph)","So i've created this post, I'm not sure why exactly, and posted it to the places that maybe my musings can maybe reach someone who needs it.  I'm currently in school as a Psych major working towards a BA in Psychology, masters in Social work with a focus in Substance abuse.  I watch Intervention every week it's on, i consider it training, and saw an episode tonight that spoke to me.
A little more background about me.  The end of 2005 was not a banner year in the PantsAreOptinoal household.  I just got out of a 6 year relationship, i was depressed, felt unloved, i was about to turn 26 in a week and I felt like my life was going nowhere.  I wound up with another woman in Aprilish of 2006 and to say it was a emotionally bad relationship would be putting it lightly.  It lead to a huge depression, which transitioned into anxiety and panic attacks and by the end of 2006 I was a shell of a man.  I had hit bottom and i was sure it hated me too.  By 2007 I was depressed, thoughts of suicide ran in and out of my head on a regular basis but i knew it wasn't a solution, just an easy way out.  In 2006 and 2007 i was as depressed as you can get without ending it, i was having 3-4 panic attacks a day on a slow day and crying uncontrollably.  in 2 years time I left my house probably twice.  Both times I was doped out of my mind so i could get out and to a doctor.  I tried to pushy myself to just walk out to my back deck and every time, i would throw up just at the thought of it.  


All hope was lost until one day, for whatever reason, i was crying my eyes out yet again and screaming loudly how i hated what my life had become.  Then i realized, i need help.  I cant fight this, whatever it was, demon for lack of a better word, without help.  it took 4 months to do it and me getting high out of my mind pretty much and my mother driving me, but i finally went to a therapist.  My therapist decided I should take some paxil to help and group therapy.  ""Hello, i have anxiety about groups of people? Fucking group therapy? Where did you graduate from? Wal-mart!?"".  Thankfully she knew more then me.  I started group and after the first meeting, driving myself there.  After just 6 months I could see the massive change that was happening for the good.  It's coming up on 3 years and i'm better then i was even before I realized i was starting to feel depressed.  I don't have group anymore, i'm off my meds and if I stay home for more than a day or two, i get cabin fever.


""So what the hell is the point in this post man? You are better, why are you posting here?""  Glad you asked.  I hope this finds someone that is at this time in their life.  Maybe more than 1.  I want you to know, wheover you are.  It can get better.  No matter how hopeless it seems, how bleak and black your future looks, stick with it.  You'll reach a point like I did.  Where you finally say ""I fucking had enough of this.  It's time I took my damn life back from this demon"" and you start doing it.  Group may be your answer, maybe meds, maybe neither but your answer is out there.  Keep looking. Do NOT give up.  We all have a purpose though you don't feel it or see it right now.  Me?  I went back to school, changed my major to Psychology and want to give back like that.  Maybe my purpose was to live through what I did so i can help others just as those who went before me reached out to me.  It's not a hyperbole to say, they literally saved my life.  You're worth saving.  Get help.

 I have two cats. They're my babies, and some days they're all that keeps me breathing ya know? Like if I didn't have them, I'd have no reason to even try and fix my situation, I'd just melt into a puddle of useless slush. But my parents are allergic. Now they've been very accommodating to me, so I don't have to get rid of them. They'll just have to stay outside in the garage with their dogs. I know I'm being silly, but I feel like such a bad mommy. Like they're gonna hate me for taking them out of their cushy inside life, to a cold winter life. Am I being stupid?

esyuj,depression,QotSa,El Mañana ,"So I've been pretty depressed and I was wondering if reddit would like to help. So it all started when I met this girl, we will call her ""lemon"" so i met lemon at a friends party and she seemed cool I didn't think of her as anymore than a friend at the time and she also had a boyfriend. Time passes and a I hang out with her, her boyfriend, my friend and his girlfriend another girl was suppose to come but she bailed. So we all hanged out at a mall and had fun. I still have no feelings for this girl until she breaks up with her boyfriend after he said some shit he shouldn't have said. I start having feelings for her I really didn't want to rush things so I thought I would wait a month or two until I would ask her out. A week later she dates some douche. I stick through it all the way through the summer we didn't really talk much until school started again we didn't have any similar classes except lunch. Then about a week or two into the school year we go to a party together. The party was incredible and according to friends we flirted alot. So after the party my friend, his girlfriend, lemon, and I walk around(lemons boyfriend wasnt invited to the party btw). We find this amazing spot where we just layed looking at the moon. Apparently she tried holding my hand too according to my friend. Then while I was over a friends house my friend tells me lemons boyfriend fingered her. Not only does this get me depressed I also remember fucked up things about my childhood that is too personal to share. Friends make fun of me(but it's not about the girl they make fun of my insecurities) go on the verge of suicide. I still loved the girl at the time, and then I found out she threw mea surprise birthday party :) I was so happy but sadly her fucking boyfriend had to be there. Then I lost a spark for her I stopped likeing her. And recently she has been a bitchy slut. A girl I loved who was nice changed. My friend and her were arguing in text and she told him ""if he asked me to have sex by now I would"" I was pissed at this point not were my friends being douches to me I had this to worry about. I stopped caring about this girl which is great bit now I feel as if I'll live my life alone and I'm still a scared child on the inside.

What can you do when you know you have a problem, but need to work to pay your bills?","I have been previously diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar disorder and general social anxiety disorder.  I have been hospitalized twice for attempted suicide, the most recent resulting in a three day stint in ICU, followed by a psychiatric commitment for four days.


Technically, I am highly functional (I've maintained jobs before and after each commitment, without playing the ""medical"" card).


After my last suicide attempt I was taken off all of the medications prescribed by my current psychiatrist (a combination of benzodiazipine's and SSRI's for depression), and upon revisiting said psychiatrist, was told that I would not be prescribed any medications unless I entered into an intensive outpatient program.

Personally, I think I need something like this.  To detail my history would really take more time than it's worth. 

At the end of the day, I'm wondering what alternatives I might have to Intensive Outpatient (where I am basically forced to leave my job, and attempt, in many cases unsuccessfully, to get state paid benefits which would not even cover my rent, never mind my cost of living).


I could spend days describing my issues, diagnoses and trials and tribulations of therapy and psychiatry.  I'm really just not sure where to go from here.  I'm doing very poorly, but being poor and/or homeless doesn't seem to me like a step in the right direction.

etk8w,depression,Aloyarcs,"Anxiety ridden, looking for info/advice","IAMA 17 year old male who's becoming increasingly concerned with anxiety issues which are leading me to feel depressed. I have a tendency of being over analytical and I've been losing interest in almost everything.

Back story: Depression started playing a role about 3 or 4 years ago.  I changed schools, lost friends and such. To make matters worse my uncle, who was like a father to me, died from liver cancer. I took heavily into World of Warcraft for about 2 years.  I didn't attempt to make friends at my new school, all I cared about was the game.  I had two close friends at this time, one, (Friend A), who was actually a cousin of mine i met at my previous school, and (Friend B) a classmate I hung around.  They both played WoW too, so we stayed close.  I eventually managed to ""get over"" this period of depression in 9th grade. I quit WoW and decided to try and make friends.  There was this one girl i had a crush on since the moment i saw her, I still remember seeing her for the first time and even though i remained distant from people, I always tried to be near her. In 10th grade we had all of our classes together, finally actually talked and hit it off really well, really really well.  I don't know if it was my history influencing it, but i finally found like I had someone to go through things with her.  It wasn't long before I fell in love.

This was a completely different point in my life, I actually cared about something over than a video game. We related in every way possible (but what young love isn't like that?) I admit, it may seem cliche, but I really found someone special to me for the first time in my life, I never felt like I had a friend like her. We soon discovered that the feelings for each other were mutual, at least the part where she liked me.  But there was a problem, She wasn't single.  Her boyfriend (Douche) was well, a douche.  No one liked him and he has no friends except her. She started going out with him Freshmen year, none of her friends liked him.  Her being in a relationship was really difficult, i guess.  She thought it was wrong to leave him for someone else. We didn't do anything physical. 

She liked video games but was never very serious. I bought her some games and we played along side with Friend A. After months of talking 24/7 she came over to my house.  She and her boyfriend were fighting, and summer was almost over.  I kissed her. She kissed back.  We were basically right below making out the rest of the day.. nothing to physical, just pecks. Happiest day of my life.

The next day she was fighting with her boyfriend, I figured she was finally done with him and stuff.  So i backed off that day, not wanting to ask her about it.  The next day i ask her, She said everything was fine between them. I exploded.  This was the start of my anxiety.  

My mother has serve anxiety, she isn't medicated, but she gets really bad sometimes.  Shes horribly afraid of shut doors, and is prone to panic attacks.

So I drop to the floor and start throwing up.  She says she loves me, but shes not ready to leave him.  I was relentless and most of the rest of the summer is a blur.  

So I start trying and struggling to remain just friends.  One night while playing games with her and friend A a thought hit me, they sounded flirty.  after a few weeks of thinking this i thought i was highly paranoid and becoming my mother.  I knew i must have been wrong, and I was driving away my friends.

One day I question her about it and she confesses.. They like each other.  My heart was utterly crushed.  I began thinking I wasn,t good enough.  Panic attacks started increasing in frequency,  I began having suicidal thoughts and crying all the time. 

Fast forward to school starting back up.  She broke up with the douche at the beginning of the year.  She stayed single for a little bit.  During this time we went to our school's pride day.  We had fun, which I didn't think was possible anymore.  My mom had dropped me off and it started raining, so she asked her mom if they could give me for a ride.  We went to walmart, before dropping me off at my house.  We rode in the truck and listened to her iPod.  Before I knew it she put on our song and she held my hand.  This was so utterly shocking to me..  This sort of things happened a few more times.  I kept going through periods of extreme optimism and pessimism.

Then a few days later she starts a relationship with friend A. After a while she cheats on him with her ex.  This goes on and off. She finally breaks up with Friend A. Goes out with her ex again for awhile (kinda), At this point he was dating another girl.  She gets fed up with him again, and goes back out with Friend A, but not officially.  Damn that weird high school drama shit. She went through some more phases of being close to me again, holding my hand and such, nothing ever serious again.

Modern Day. Shes going out with Friend A, and I'm kind of accepting it now.  Despite that we aren't doing well.  She feels that Friend B has taken her place of best friend, which he hasn't.  I've done everything to show how much she means to me.  I got really bad with depression for awhile.  I had a few suicidal episodes, but I've never gotten to the point of attempting.  I think its really started to make her distant.

Over the past month I've gotten really better with the whole depression thing, but our relationship is still in the gutter. I'm really concerned with irritating her with psychotic episodes. 




I'm getting bad panic attacks every few days.  In the past I've feared being put on pills.  But I'm starting to accept it as an option.  I do have some fear and concerns. My family hasn't been doing financially great lately, but were not too bad off.  Im worried about the cost of treatment, and what treatment for anxiety like this entails.

TL:DR Was depressed, two friends in the world, made a new one, who I thought was basically my soul mate. Rejected by her, and now shes going out with one of my only other friends.  This has made me have increasingly serve anxiety and I'm concerned about costs and treatment that i can expect.

Due to the position I'm in right now, I don't have anyone to talk to and I really need someone to talk right now. I've been depressed for who knows how long now. I've never sought out medical help, I never thought I needed and was in denial about being depressed. Work just got worse which is adding to my depression, and the girl I've been trying to develop a relationship with, well, it's complicated to say the least. I stopped drinking, knowing that it will not help me in any way. There's too much to talk about in a self post but if anyone is willing to listen, please leave some sort of IM or email.

etvip,depression,icantdoit1111,Advice?,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I'm kinda guessing here.

My life has been tumbling for a few years and I'm hitting a breaking point. I've tried to kill myself twice this fall, and spent a decent amount of time in the hospital. I've been diagnosed with schitzoaffective disorder. I keep trying to get help, but nothing is working. I've been on a number of different meds and they all either don't work at all or make me suicidal. I've been out of work for a year and a half, I'm completely broke, and it's gotten to the point where I can't even get off the couch without having a panic attack.

I'm not suicidal now, but I need help and I don't know what my options are. My doctors aren't helping, and I don't have money to see a good doctor. I need something to change, but I don't know how to do it, and I'm terrified of doing something that will make me worse again. I can't get any lower without risk of suicide.

What options are there for me to get help?",11,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/etvip/advice/,1293748545

I'm even in college for medicine, but with no real interest I dont see a reason to do it, or to study or do anything actually. And I have no idea what to do.

i feel like no matter how hard i try i am not getting anywhere. people my age go out and have fun etc. when i am busy stressing about everything. i cant focus at uni cos of all the crap happening around. $!#$!%!# i dont even know how to put my problems into words for it to make sense. 

i am single and every man that comes my way are fucking jerks. last 3 i have been involved with had gfs. wtf is with men these days? where are all the good men? i dont need the comfort of a man to be happy in life, but i am sure like most girls would feel the same way when i say its nice to have someone to do nothing with (but not be dependent on him). 

i am lacking motivation for anything in life. i dont feel like seeing my friends cos i have to be all smiles and happy, force myself not to break down into tears. house mates i avoid, because i am sick of seeing them licking each other's face when ever they are at home or anywhere together infact (they are a couple). parents who keep reminding me how much of a disappointment i am and managed to accomplish nothing in life and i am 23. @$!#$#!!

eu2sk,depression,Indiepressed,I thought I was getting over it. Things just got so much worse. (long post),"So here's the deal guys. 

My best friend died in September of 2009 and I think that's what eventually led me into my (self diagnosed) depression. I was fine all the way up until about the end of Senior year of high school which was in 2010. After that things got so bad. This summer was by far the best of my life because I had a group of awesome friends but problems arose as things went on. 

One of my two best friends left for the military and I fell into a hopeless teenage crush with his girlfriend (the second best friend of mine). This actually had happened while they were going out and honestly, this was wrecking me. 

I have never had a girlfriend and I'm 18. I always get told that I'm cute and adorable and honestly, those comments hurt because I *know* that girls don't want to go out with guys who are *adorable.* I try in this aspect of breaking my streak of loneliness. I'm very outgoing and am a really nice guy I just never find anyone who wants me and it hurts. It really does. 

To add on, my friend's girlfriend and me got really close over the summer and I started to like her more. Of course, since she already had him and he made her happy, she didn't like me. I've grown to love her as a platonic friend but it still hurts because deep down I still have these feelings I suppress because I know it will never happen. Plus since I moved away to college, she's become closer with another friend of mine. We used to do so much together. We used to go out to eat and just drive around and talk. We used to talk every day. She used to text me and see how my day was going. Ever since college started, that has all dwindled down and died. 

I went to college as a Physics major with no real background in Physics. I was hoping I could pick up on what I needed in the class with some hard work. Well, the first two or three weeks went by and I was falling further and further behind. I couldn't keep up on the work in the class, the reading, and all the homework from my other classes. I decided I would switch to a lower Physics class. I did and I still did terribly. I withdrew from it and accepted the W on my transcript. 

After this, I just fell into what I thought would be my deepest phase of depression. My best friend was upset and not doing well since her boyfriend left for the military. I was trying to comfort her while trying to cope with this terrible feeling of depression. We used each other as supports which was probably a terrible idea since she has a lot more supports than just me. 

By this point we were still texting everyday and talking on the phone twice a week for about an hour. But I was a shell of myself. I had to put on an act to be myself in front of my college friends. By the end of dinner with them I felt mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted. I would go to lay down and sleep and I wouldn't sleep a wink. Either that or I would sleep for 14 hours and miss two classes, one being at 9AM (Psychology) and one being at 1PM (Calculus 1). I would miss both. It was bad. 

Soon it got to the point where I wouldn't eat for a day or two at a time. I would stay back from dinner because I 'felt sick' or because 'I had an essay to write.' Then it got to the point where I would not sleep for 40+ hours at a time. I pulled 42 hours once and 36 hours another time in a two week interval. Then the next week I would sleep 12+ hours a day and then go to bed after being awake for 8 hours and then repeat. 

My best friend (the girl) finally convinced me to see a social worker for free from the mental health department. I hate the stigma that comes with being depressed (people treat you differently) so I always put it off. Once I went, I got there and within 10 minutes I was sobbing like a little bitch in my chair. I felt terrible. I was having dreams where I would die and no one would cry or attend my funeral. It was just bad. 

By the end of the semester, finals were creeping up and my 9AM class was just fucked. Seriously fucked. I barely went. I never studied or read. I always slept through it because I had no motivation to go to class? Fuck it, why should I? Why should I ever get out of bed? I finished my papers for every class and studied for Math because it's the only thing I care about academically anymore. 

I should also mention at this point that my friend got out of basic training and could text people now so my best friend pretty much stopped being there when I needed her. Then we found out he was home for Christmas and New Years. That's good news but that means that I probably won't have any support that I so vitally need now. 

After finals I went home for Christmas. My best friend was home from the military and hanging out with his girlfriend and my other close friends. They all went to see Tron and invited me. I had literally no money or car anymore. Usually they offer to give me a ride or spot me but nothing. 'Hey what are you guys up to?' 'We're seeing Tron and HP5. You should come.' 'I have no money or ride.' 'Oh okay.'

We were supposed to meet up later at a mutual friend's house and we did but I had spent the last 5 hours alone in my room sulking because my friends didn't want me around. I went home, smoked a huge bowl and sulked in my room until the high wore off and then I drove to the meetup. My body was there but not me. I didn't want to be. 

But you know, by the end of the semester, I was feeling pretty alright. This day where my best friend came home and saw me for 3 hours after being gone for 6 months kind of hurt but it was the worst day I'd had in a while. In college, I smoked a lot of weed and got a lot done in every class but Psych. I was happy around people, talkative, and didn't feel drained. I felt as close to happy as I can remember. 

Now we fast forward to after Christmas; so now. I decided I wanted to tell my parents about my depression and talking to a social worker and my bad grade. My plan was to tell them after New Years but we ended up going on a trip to visit relatives in Maine until NY Eve. Well today we were sitting around and my 2 brothers were giving me shit about something and my dad joined in and started berating me like usual.

eu325,depression,rmm45177,It's 2 in the morning and I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking about how much I've fucked up my life.,"I just turned 17 the other day and had another birthday all by myself. I've been trying to get in the mindset that having friends or not don't really matter but that's just bullshit I tell myself. The reality is that I desperately want friends but I've just gotten to the point where I've given up on having any. I keep worrying about getting older because even though I don't like school, I don't know how I'll be able to go on when its done. Everyone else has their lives all planned out and they have people who care about them and will help them not fall in their face. I feel like I'm way behind. I just can't believe that I missed out on being a kid and the reality that I'll never have a 2nd chance is too much for me.
