Other than the torturing bugs though, I can pretty much relate to most of what you said/have done. I can also relate to the mental health issues you listed too. I've been diagnosed with a bunch of things. (Also, torturing bugs is one thing a lot of people do... Torturing small animals or any animal with a larger brain capacity is cruel and a bit different, imo. My mom used to burn ants with a magnifying glass and she's doing fine now. Lol) \\n\\nI don't think there's anything wrong with your personality though! I think you just need to try your best to embrace the certain aspects of your personality that are more positive or that make you feel positive. I'm working on this myself too, and I was thinking: if attempting to help someone else out through a comment makes them feel a little better, it'll make me feel a little better too. (hopefully?) \\n\\nAnyways though Imo, lots of people are naturally inclined to want to see gross stuff. I don't know the psychology behind it... But when you think about it, the whole horror movie genre exists because people like to see stuff like that. You could always strive to get a job in the entertainment industry and try to replicate things for horror movies or shows? My point here is, even though I don't personally know you, there are so many jobs or things you can do to contribute to the world.\\n\\nTo add to that, I've been learning myself that a lot of how I feel is due to my perspective on things. It's easy for me (someone not feeling your feelings atm) to be able to look at the stuff you listed from a different/more positive perspective... But when you're feeling like shit then its almost as if you get stuck looking at everything from a negative perspective.\\n\\nAlso, I don't remember if you mentioned anything about seeing a counselor/med provider but meds definitely do help for me personally. Even if you're not in counseling or anything I don't think it would be a bad thing to talk to someone licensed in psychology so they can help you out and tell you why you're feeling the way you are feeling. You just have to find the right counselor too... I started in counseling myself a long time ago and it took me years and many, MANY counsellors, but I finally found a great guy to talk to.\\n\\nApologies for including so many stories about myself but I can just really relate to what you're going through and it sucks.

       "  \"First. I am sorry that you're struggling. It's hard when you feel like the only person in the room who can see what's happening and no one is listening so you are forced to sit back and watch the train wreck dumpster fire happen in slow motion.... Except if I'm reading it correctly-nothing happens. Just the replay. In fact, it sounds like you might actually be living for once. And that can be terrifying when you don't know what to expect. Of yourself and of the world. When it hurts so much and you feel so invisible-of course you're going to hurt yourself. You need to have that pain validated somehow and if this is the way to make it stop well oh fuckin K then! Except.... EXCEPT-That's the lie our illness tells us. It's the trap that keeps us stuck in unhealthy coping mechanisms-because those mechanisms are going to help perpetuate the illness. With me, PTSD and the isolation that I put myself through to feel safe-was the worst thing I could do to for self care. I am a recovered cutter. I have a sponsor that I call when I feel some kind of way. I have been incident free since 2015. Why do I say all of this? To show you that sometimes the only way out is through. And the first step to that is giving yourself some serious grace and compassion. The toxic shame was crippling for me. The fear of discovery, the shame of the act, lying to my friends and family, the creeping feeling of inevitability and failure. I just wanted to be seen. I just needed the emotional noise inside me to shut the fuck up for five seconds so I could breathe! I wanted someone to save me. I wanted to save myself. And none of that is possible without hope and connection. Without those things life is just an endless sea of grey... And for me? That grey was all the different ways I was going to be hurt. And those around me. I want you to know that it feels big in the moment because it's the first real time you're feeling IT. Like Neo in the matrix using his eyes for the first time. Living is hard normally. But if you've had coping skills that have severely inhibited your emotional growth-then when you start feeling those things-fully, it can be very overwhelming. The thing is thought-not to get swept away. And if you do-to be forgiving to yourself for perceived mistakes. Being vulnerable IS NOT the same as being unsafe. It took me the better part of a decade to crawl out of the hole my mental health dug for me. It took another 2 years to get over the shame of what I didn't understand before. And now I am here-talking to you. Do not ever discount your experience and what you have to offer the world-your close relationships, and yourself. The world absolutely needs more of you, not less. Not ever. You can uncover what you need to heal. You can get your illnesses to a manageable level for YOU- and that is is different than what neurotypical judge is normal. It took me far longer then it should have to realize I was judging myself by a set of standards that were not my own and that I often didn't actually believe in. Unwrapping those cognitive distortions really helped go a long way to determining my own way through the world. I know you said therapy isn't working-I disagree. Your current provider is what's failing. Not the science.  Try another until you find one that encourages emotional safety. Once you get that-they can guide you towards true healing. I also recommend getting a sponsor for your darker times. It has saved me many times over the years as I've struggled through my trauma work. I know when you're dark inside hurting yourself sounds like a great idea. But, like the darkness-it is a temporary feeling and it Does pass. Please don't make any more permanent decisions in the moment based on temporary feelings. I see you. There are no quick fixes or magic buttons. But there is light. And you do deserve it. Please follow up with a mental health professional as soon as you can to discuss next steps. You got this, I promise you... Just keep swimming.\\n-Edit- TL;DR: Please watch Everything, Everywhere, All at Once if you haven't already : )\",\n",

Most people on here would tell me: \"you\\'re dumb you believe in the mystical sky creature and storybook\"...) I know, I\\'m not claiming to be smart either, just stating what I personally believe and I believe that all you have to do is ask and try your best and He will forgive you. I won\\'t mention my personal sky guy beliefs anymore tho. \\n\\nIMO, lots of people have done bad things, (myself included) what really matters is if you keep choosing to make bad decisions or do bad things even if you know that what you are doing is wrong. \\n\\nImo, if you know what you\\'re doing is wrong and you really CANT stop yourself from doing it, it would be amazing for you to realize that it isn\\'t something you can control/conquer on your own and it just means your brain may be lacking certain chemicals or something else. \\n\\nYou already are getting professional help with it though! As dumb as it sounds, you\\'re already making good choices on your own. At some point you MIGHT need to try to control or \"reign in\" the amount of time you spend on a certain subject with the thoughts. It seems like since you still have the ability to make good choices, you might have the ability to control the thoughts? I can\\'t say whether you can or not. If it\\'s to the point where you really can\\'t control them though, again that\\'s extreme and you def gotta get some help with that! No one should have to continue to live like that on their own. \\n\\nIn terms of the looping thoughts, I have personally had the same thing and I just needed to get the right medication for that to subside a little.  I remember it being super draining though and if it\\'s causing you not to sleep or it\\'s invasive to your life, then you\\'re already exhausted, then add on that your brain is running at full capacity all the time, so just make sure to show yourself compassion! You\\'re just struggling at the moment but you got this! \\n\\nThe other thing is, thinking that you don\\'t deserve a good life just because you\\'ve done bad things isn\\'t true (again imo) . I think everyone deserves a good life. If that individual is actively trying to work on themself, then they deserve a good life imo.\\n\\nGood luck at your counseling appointment tomorrow too. Hopefully your counselor can explain some of the science behind why you\\'re feeling the way you\\'re feeling so that it may be more than just \"reassurance\" that they\\'re providing??  If this is a new counselor, it may take awhile to find a good person though. (again, just my experience)... If you already know them and they\\'re good just ignore this part!']]"
